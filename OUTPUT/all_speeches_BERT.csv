123,r081021a_BOA,australia,2008-10-21,        ,stevens,1,"Turkish soldier is said to have asked some New Zealand prisoners why it was that they had come so far, voluntarily, to fi ght a war in Europe. They apparently replied that they had expected it to be rather like playing a game of rugby. It is not recorded how Australians answered the same question (perhaps they could not decide which code of football was most apt). But they certainly also went in a spirit of optimism. That optimism was soon a casualty of war. Optimism seems also to have been a casualty of recent fi nancial events abroad, as outcomes have been rather unlike what the sophisticated modern set of institutions and markets were supposed to have delivered. Many have observed that the world faces the most serious international fi nancial crisis since the 1930s. The world has, of course, experienced many crises, of various kinds over the decades, not least the one to which the ANZACs responded. These were often, in terms of potential and actual human misery, far more perilous than today's fi nancial dislocation. Nonetheless, the situation is very serious. It is up to policy-makers and private market participants to put the system back together, without the excesses that built up over the past years, so that it can serve its proper function: facilitating trade and genuine investment fl ows, in the process supporting economic growth. For this audience, I had intended to talk about the Australian and New Zealand economies - noting some of their similarities and differences, and common interests. Given the circumstances, I will touch briefl y on those issues, and then devote some time as well to talking about our shared interests in getting the global fi nancial system back into shape. It is stating the obvious that the two countries have a lot in common, dating back at least to James Cook. We share the British system of laws and custom, the historical relative geographical isolation from 'old' Europe, an increasing orientation towards Asia, and generally an outwardlooking mentality refl ecting small economic size. Notwithstanding that Australia's GDP is seven times that of New Zealand, we still see ourselves as small. There is a signifi cant amount of grassroots integration between the two countries which has occurred fairly naturally. Apart from the relative ease of population fl ows - which facilitates labour mobility - one is struck by the number of Australia-New Zealand Associations and Societies of one kind or another. Try an online search of the words 'Australia, New Zealand, association and society' to see what I mean. The industry structures of the two economies differ somewhat, refl ecting natural resource endowments (Table 1). Australia has more mining, but less manufacturing and farming, as a share of GDP, than New Zealand. But on the whole, the differences are perhaps not as striking as the similarities. The two countries do a good deal of bilateral trade, helped by the Australia New Zealand and Australia is easily New Zealand's largest trading partner. Interestingly enough, though, while growth in trans-Tasman trade has been faster than growth in trade with Japan, the United Kingdom or the United States, traditionally big trading partners, it is not especially fast. The most striking thing is that growth in trade with China and other east Asian economies has been much faster for both countries than growth in trade with each other, despite the CER. I am neither arguing that the CER restrains trade nor that it might not be amenable to improvement to facilitate further trade. I simply observe that the massive increase in the prominence of Asia in the global economy over Agriculture, forestry and fi shing Total of above Finance, property and business services Health, education and community services Wholesale and retail trade Utilities and transport Government administration and defence Communication services the past 25 years provided both countries with opportunities. We are both able to take those opportunities because of the open approach we have taken to trade generally. Both economies have a high export rate of commodities - relatively more minerals for Australia and more agricultural products for New Zealand. Not surprisingly therefore, both countries have had very signifi cant changes in our terms of trade over the past several years. New Zealand is a more open economy than Australia, so a rise in the terms of trade of any given percentage has a larger effect on incomes there. But the sheer magnitude of the terms of trade gain for Australia means that the gain in real domestic income over the past fi ve years was roughly double the size of the impact in New Zealand. In both cases, the terms of trade look like they are now starting to moderate. The two countries share structural policy features: * fl oating currencies and central banks with a medium-term, fl exible infl ation-targeting approach to monetary policy. New Zealand was, along with Canada, a pioneer of infl ation targeting; and a history of governments, of varying political persuasions, which have maintained a general commitment to market-opening, liberalising policies over the past generation, including fi nancial liberalisation. The two countries also share the same major banking groups, with the large four Australian banks having New Zealand subsidiaries and branches. The operations of these entities account for 90 per cent of the market for bank deposits and loans in New Zealand. For that reason, Australia and New Zealand have a common interest in sound functioning of the international fi nancial system being restored. Our fi nancial systems, like those of most countries these days, are connected to global markets and our large fi nancial institutions are active in international markets. So there are impacts on our systems of the extreme dislocation in international markets, even though the Australian banks have strong balance sheets with good asset quality. Moreover, these same disturbances are in the process of slowing down major economies and hence global growth, which obviously will have some impact on our own economies. It is time therefore that I turned to say something about those issues. The genesis of the problems - the search for yield in a lengthy period of low global interest rates, the associated disregard for growing risk, structural fl aws in the 'originate and distribute' model of fi nancing, the deterioration in lending standards - have been discussed at length over the past year. For today, it suffi ces to say that a lot of new risk was created and, far from being widely dispersed, a good deal of it ended up on the balance sheets of the most leveraged parts of the international fi nancial system - banks and investment banks. The problems of counterparty risk aversion and reluctance to lend at term - that is, a breakdown in trust - fi rst erupted in August last year. Term borrowing rates rose sharply relative to overnight rates. This intensifi ed through to the end of each calendar quarter as bank accounting dates approached, and lessened thereafter. This cycle was repeated several times through to the middle of 2008. While that was going on, a number of major international institutions accepted write-downs of their exposures to US mortgages, which were often via complex structured products whose prices proved to be very volatile - when they could be measured at all. They simultaneously sought new capital, though as fast as they received it, capital was being burned up in losses. Things proceeded in this way for over a year, without getting noticeably worse, but not getting noticeably better. Then during the months of September and October 2008, in a sequence of events historians will study at length for decades ahead, the international fi nancial landscape changed dramatically. In the space of six weeks: * the remaining four large American investment banks disappeared - into bankruptcy, merger or by taking a banking licence, which gets them closer to the support of the * one of the world's largest insurance companies, hit by a wave of margin calls on credit default insurance contracts it had written, had to take a loan from the Federal Reserve and is effectively in public ownership; * the largest participants in the US mortgage market, which had always been seen as implicitly government guaranteed, were explicitly nationalised; * the US Treasury brought forward a plan to purchase assets from lenders' balance sheets for a sum of up to 5 per cent of US GDP. A version of this plan was approved on the second attempt, after several anxious days in which confi dence was further eroded; * a number of European banks faced failure, including some quite large ones, and needed government support or were nationalised; and * governments in a number of countries felt the need to guarantee some or all of the deposit obligations of their banks. While this was occurring, global markets for equities, currencies and commodities saw extraordinary price movements, while yields on many short-term government securities fell sharply. Volatility in daily prices increased signifi cantly. Interbank and commercial paper markets, which had already been under pressure, effectively closed in a number of countries. (It is worth noting that most key markets in Australia have continued to function through this period, even if under some pressure.) The extreme counterparty risk aversion in markets saw the shortage of US dollar liquidity in the European and Asian time zones worsen seriously, to the point that the effective cost of borrowing US dollars via swap in the Asian time zone reached well into double digits in mid September, and on some days the market was, for all intents and purposes, not available. The fall in commodity prices brought pressure to some emerging-market countries, which saw falls in currencies and share prices, and which in some cases closed share markets. Since late September, many currencies have come under downward pressure against currencies like the yen, which was a favoured funding currency for various positions in higher-yielding currencies. The Australian dollar fell particularly sharply, in part because of the changes in interest rate expectations and commodity prices, and partly because its relatively liquid market sees it used by many managers as a device to change quickly their exposures to some other currencies and commodity-based strategies. In summary, what appeared for the preceding year to be a serious, but containable, problem of liquidity and concerns over creditworthiness turned suddenly into a very fast-moving crisis of confi dence in key players in the international fi nancial system, where questions of solvency came much more to the fore. It has presented fi nanciers, and policy-makers, with the most diffi cult set of challenges of its kind for generations. The question, then, is how to restore confi dence and stability to these important markets and institutions. The fi rst thing is to continue to provide liquidity. This requires central banks to expand their balance sheets if necessary, so that the private fi nancial sector can continue to fund its existing asset book for the time being, and so that the broader process of deleveraging can be accommodated with as little disruption as possible. Central banks have stepped up their liquidity efforts in a major way, with a number of them providing much more in the way of own-currency funding against a wider range of collateral. But the most visible impact is on the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, where assets have nearly doubled in the past six weeks as a result of increases in the Fed's various facilities. An increase in swap lines with other central banks, which allows the supply of dollar liquidity in Asian and European time zones, has been one large contributor to the expansion (and the RBA has participated in these lines). The most recent development has seen this liquidity operate on tap in several major countries - at a fi xed price, in any amount market participants require, for terms extending out to three months. As a result, there is now a huge amount of US dollar liquidity in the system. But while liquidity provision helps, it can, at best, ameliorate the impact of counterparty risk. It cannot eliminate it. The second thing that is needed is a restoration of confi dence in the key fi nancial institutions. Because the lack of confi dence is, ultimately, about solvency, re-capitalisation of the relevant institutions is required. The lesson of past banking crises, moreover, is that when there are really serious problems in private balance sheets, capital may be available in suffi cient quantity only from the public purse. This should of course come with appropriate conditions - private shareholders should absorb the losses from past problems, governments that put in new capital should share in the upside and guarantees that are offered should be priced. Governments should plan to divest their holdings in banks in due course. The UK Government's plan announced a couple of weeks ago, which seems to have become something of a template for these sorts of intervention, appears to have the key elements needed to restore health to the key international institutions. It increases further the supply of liquidity for the short term. It also provides for an increase in the capital of key UK institutions, from the public sector if needed, via the government underwriting capital raising. And it provides some confi dence for term funding markets by offering a guarantee of the debt obligations of the relevant banks for a period of time. This guarantee is not free to the banks - they will pay for it on commercial terms, which in the current environment are unlikely to be cheap. The intention is not to subsidise the price of borrowing but, by promoting confi dence of repayment, to allow the market to fi nd an appropriate price, which of late it has had trouble doing. The Australian response has taken careful note of the elements of this plan which are pertinent to our situation. The RBA's liquidity facilities had already been further expanded, to allow our counterparties to bring to us internally securitised mortgages as collateral, to get funding for out to a year. This is available at market prices every day. The additional eligible collateral available to the Australian system as a result of the most recent changes can support over $50 billion of additional liquidity (after allowing for haircuts), if needed. The Australian Government has announced a general guarantee of deposits, as a precaution to allay any public anxiety over security of their savings. It has also decided to offer to guarantee wholesale debt obligations of Australian authorised deposit-takers and authorised Australian subsidiaries of foreign banks, on commercial terms. This will ensure that Australian institutions, some of which are among the highest rated of the world's banks, are able to retain adequate access to term funding in an environment where banks of other countries are able, in effect, to use the rating of their governments when borrowing. Steps in these directions, in the context of what other countries were doing, were sensible and the Reserve Bank supported them. As is also the case in other countries, the design features of the various guarantees will be important. Little detail is available from other countries yet. Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank is working with our colleagues in the Treasury on the details of the Australian arrangements, including on how to maintain continued healthy functioning of Australia's short-term money markets. The element of the UK plan Australia has not sought to emulate is public underwriting of capital injections. The Australian banks have strong capital positions and profi ts, so they should be able to approach the market on normal commercial terms if they desire additional capital. At moments like this, it is hazardous to make predictions. However, it seems to me that the key elements of dealing with the root issues in the crisis are starting to come into place. Policy-makers in the major countries do 'get it'. The plans are not precisely uniform across countries - that is never achievable anyway - but we can, I think, see the shape of a broad common outline. It addresses the issues of liquidity, capital and confi dence. There is much more work to be done yet on the design details, and one area in which further international co-operation would be helpful is in the area of making these various guarantee arrangements broadly consistent. But the world is, it seems to me, getting on to a better path. As a result, the likelihood of a global catastrophe has in fact declined over the past couple of weeks. The question of the appropriate macroeconomic policy settings to help economies through this period will also be receiving attention around the world. In those countries where previous settings have been prudent, and where infl ation prospects permit, policies can be eased to counteract some of the contractionary forces set in train by the deterioration in global growth prospects resulting from the credit turmoil. Central banks in major countries, recognising weaker demand and the likelihood of easing pressures on prices, reduced interest rates in October. In Australia, the Reserve Bank made a substantial cut to the cash rate at its October meeting, bringing forward reductions that might ordinarily have taken place over several months. CPI infl ation is likely to remain high in the period immediately ahead, and yesterday's PPI data illustrate the concerns that the Bank has long expressed about infl ation. But looking forward to next year, forces seem now to be building that will start to dampen pressures on prices - even though we won't have evidence for that for a good six months. The Board sought, as always, to respond to the medium-term outlook for prices, not just the current data. The Australian Government has made a signifi cant change to the fi scal stance which will fl ow through the demand side of the economy during the summer. The decline in the Australian dollar by about 20 per cent against a trade-weighted basket also amounts to a signifi cant change for the trade-exposed sectors of the economy, though at the cost of some temporarily higher price rises. These changes will act to lessen the extent of the likely slowdown in Australia's economy, even as global forces work the other way. The Reserve Bank will publish its next update on the economic outlook on 10 November, so I will not say any more about that today. I shall fi nish with the question of what trends will be of importance beyond that horizon. As I have said before, the emergence of China is not complete and has many years to run. Right now, China's economy is slowing. This is a reminder that China's economy has cycles, like economies everywhere. But even if it slows a lot, it will pick up again in due course and will probably grow pretty strongly, on average, over many years. In countries like Australia, perhaps the long period of household debt build-up is now giving way to a period in which balance sheets will see some consolidation. If so, household credit growth will not be as fast as it was for the past decade and a half. Perhaps we will need also to get better at turning borrowing for housing into more dwellings rather than just higher house prices. Perhaps the fi nance sector globally will return to fulfi lling something more like its historical role of being 'the handmaiden of industry', with a bit less in the way of exotic innovation of its own. In such a world, a renewed focus on the processes in the real economy which generate growth in productivity could also be apt. In the case of Australia at least, it is now hard to avoid the conclusion that underlying growth in productivity has slowed over the past fi ve years, compared with what was seen through most of the 1990s and the early part of this decade. Of course, these things are notoriously hard to measure and there will be various opinions about the extent of the slowing, why it occurred and what might be done about it. Nonetheless, once the immediate crisis has passed, that might be a conversation worth having.","['anzacs', 'crises', 'optimism', 'crisis', 'turkish']","['anzacs responded', 'decades anzacs', 'war optimism', 'functioning australia', 'australian response']","['decades anzacs responded', 'war optimism casualty', 'kinds decades anzacs', 'anzacs responded terms', 'casualty war optimism']"
131,r090604a_BOA,australia,2009-06-04,NO_INFO,stevens,1,"Thank you to James Cook University for organising this occasion and for the invitation to take part. Townsville and the surrounding region boast a significant set of industries. Townsville provides a port and refining capacity for important parts of the mining sector. It is an export point for the live cattle industry, sugar and a range of other rural industries. For the tourist industry, it is an access point to the Great Barrier Reef and home to research into the marine environment. It is the base for an important part of Australia's defence capability. Of course, the University is also a strong centre for higher education. A number of the University's graduates in economics have become prominent in the world of finance and business. So it is a pleasure to be here, to talk about how economic conditions are unfolding, including in countries and industries in which this region has more than a passing interest. About a month ago, the Reserve Bank released its May . I want to give an update on that material, though developments have not caused us greatly to change our views. I will start with the international economy. The current global recession is being widely referred to as the most significant of the post-War period. There is, by now, little debate about that description. It is not necessarily the case, however, that it will be the biggest recession for all individual economies. It will be for many, but quite a few have seen larger recessions at some point in the previous six decades than they appear to be experiencing now. For some countries in Asia and Latin America, other episodes, with other causes, were more damaging than what has been observed, at least so far, this time. I do not think it will be the biggest recession of the post-War period in Australia either, though of course we will not know for sure for a while yet. Rather, it is the exceptional synchronicity of the international downturn that has been so remarkable. It is well known, of course, that the financial crisis had its genesis in lax lending in some of the major economies, and cheap credit generally, earlier in this decade. This has been well covered before, so I will not go over it today. Rather, I would like to focus on the sharp deterioration in global demand for goods and services that occurred late in 2008 and early this year. There are some important features of this event that help us to understand both our own experiences in Australia and those of other countries. Historians will study this episode for years to come. They may find additional nuances, but one very clear trigger for the sharp collapse in demand was the heightening of stress in financial markets. A sequence of extraordinary events occurred in September and October last year. These the US Government taking over the two largest housing finance entities; the bankruptcy of one of the four remaining large US investment banks, which people had presumed was 'too big to fail'; the US Government taking over one of the world's largest insurance companies; and in short order, pressure on systemically important institutions across the United States and Europe. Combined, this previously almost-unthinkable sequence resulted in a sharp increase in perceived systemic risk in financial markets and systems everywhere. Stock prices fell sharply around the world. Risk spreads on all sorts of debt instruments blew out, and capital markets for issuing (or rolling over) debt and equity essentially closed. It was the most turbulent period in international finance any current banker, economist, market trader or policy-maker has lived through or, we hope, ever will. Unlike most previous financial crises, moreover, the news about this set of events reached people all over the world very quickly. They did not learn about it the way they once might have: sequentially, with varying lags, via delayed print media, word of mouth, high-brow publications and so on. Instead, they learned about it simultaneously, via the 24-hour news cycle, in every country, more or less in real time. Not surprisingly, people everywhere suddenly became much more fearful of the future. In the face of this acute uncertainty, firms and households across the world did what you would expect. They acted in a precautionary way. They postponed discretionary purchases, shelved expansion plans and did what they could to consolidate their balance sheets. result was a highly synchronised slump in demand especially for consumer durables and investment goods. Production and consumption of more 'everyday' non-durable goods and services did fall, but by much less than for those products that could easily be purchased tomorrow rather than The nature of this slump helps us to understand both the relative performance of various national economies and the subsequent behaviour of production generally. It has become much clearer over the past month or two, for example, that the countries hardest hit have been those that are most involved in the production and export of these the major economies, Japan and Germany have seen the biggest falls in output. Among emerging market countries, some of the biggest contractions were among the Asian nations that are an integral part of the production chain for consumer durables. If the fall in global demand in late 2008 was rapid, the cut in production was even more aggressive as firms sought to reduce inventories. In many countries, these had tended to rise a little going into the crisis. As demand fell away, firms were faced with further increases in stocks of unsold items, at a time when the cost of funding them was moving up. Hence, they sought to get inventories down quickly as part of their strategy of surviving the downturn. To achieve a reduction in inventories, firms must cut production by more than demand, so that the level of production falls below the level of demand for a time. This is indeed what seems to have occurred in many cases. Once inventories are back under control, production will rise, back up to the level of demand. This is what we seem to be seeing now in some countries, particularly around Asia. Industrial production has risen quite sharply over the past few months, and in some cases has retraced a good deal of the earlier fall. The clearest signs of growth are in China, where our estimates are that industrial production had recovered all the losses by March. China does not publish quarterly GDP growth rates, but our best estimates are that the March quarter growth rate picked up relative to the weak outcome in the December quarter. The improvement in conditions in other emerging economies in Asia may be partly related to the pick-up in China. Quite a marked bounce in industrial output has occurred in Korea and Taiwan, and a similar pattern looks to be emerging in several other countries in the region. Even Japan's production now seems to be rising, though from extremely weak levels. Across the leading industrial economies, the best we can say at present is that while the contraction in overall output in the March quarter was broadly similar to that in the December quarter, recent data suggest that the rate of contraction in the June quarter will be significantly smaller. Now while the initial pick-up in output is coming from this inventory cycle running its course, that only lifts production to the level of demand, which remains lower than it was before. An ongoing rise in output will depend on demand starting to increase. Again, the clearest indication of stronger demand is in some of the emerging economies, particularly China. The improvement in China's growth does not seem to be coming from Chinese exports to the developed world, but from stronger demand at home. The reversal of earlier restrictive policies designed to slow the Chinese economy because of inflation concerns, together with a government spending package that by any standards has been very large, have both contributed. To date, the recovery has been led by increased spending on infrastructure. What is not yet clear is the extent to which Chinese private-sector demand is accelerating. A pick-up in China is relatively beneficial to Australia, as I will discuss in a moment. For the world economy, it will also be beneficial if the emerging world relies more on domestic demand for growth than it has in the past decade. A durable expansion will be one that is more balanced than the last one. That said, prospects for demand in the developed world obviously remain very important because of the still very large size of those economies. Most observers expect that demand in the United States and Europe (including the United Kingdom) will be quite subdued for a few years. One might, of course, ask whether the striking speed and simultaneity of the downturn could be seen again in the upswing. The reason people think such an outcome is unlikely is that the loss of wealth during 2008 and the need for private-sector balance sheets to be deleveraged are thought likely to constrain both household demand and the ability of the banking sector to expand credit, for some time. This is a reasonable reading of the history of most financial crises, and underpins the consensus forecast that global growth, when it resumes, will be pretty modest initially. Yet the speed and size of the responses to the downturn by policy-makers around the world is just as unprecedented as the speed and size of the downturn itself. If there were an upside surprise on global growth, it would most likely be because the collective effects of all those policy responses turned out to be bigger than expected, perhaps because those expectations were formed by looking at a history where such simultaneous responses rarely occurred. Having said that, the size of the build-up in government debt in some of the major economies will surely become much more of a constraint on their fiscal room for manoeuvre over the next decade. Let me be clear that i am not talking about australia here ; rather, I have in mind countries where public debt could approach 100 per cent of annual GDP over the next few years. It is not that these magnitudes are completely unmanageable, but they will constrain choices to an extent these countries have not been accustomed to for a long time. For example, their capacity to cushion the impact of another downturn, were one to occur in six or seven years' time, would be limited. The developments in the world economy over the past year have had a significant effect on our economy. One key channel has been the impact on commodity markets, where prices fell sharply in the second half of last year. It has been apparent for some time from developments in markets for coal and iron ore that there would be large downward adjustments to the contract prices for those commodities when they were renegotiated this year. Those falls have now largely been realised, broadly in line with what was expected. Compared with last year, there will be a lot less revenue coming in. But it is important to remember that commodity prices remain high by historical standards. Even with falls of 45-60 per cent for coal and around 35 per cent for iron ore, the 2009/10 prices are the second highest on record in US dollar terms. Five or six years ago, these sorts of prices would have seemed extraordinary. As the outlook for resources demand becomes clearer, and the uncertainty in financial markets continues to lift, it would not be surprising if plans for new mining projects that are being deferred at present were re-activated at some point, though this, even if it occurred, would presumably take some time to flow through into actual spending. The volume of Australian exports, moreover, has so far held up remarkably well, especially compared with those of some other countries (Table 1). Even people who were relatively optimistic, as I was, have been a bit surprised by this strength. december quarter 2008 march quarter 2009 Six months to march quarter - - - - australia - Excluding rural exports Part of the relative strength may reflect supply-side factors: a larger wheat crop in 2008 and the commencement of operation of an additional LNG compression train have both added to supply. There are, however, some particularly interesting developments in the pattern of demand for coal and iron ore. A large proportion of Australian iron ore goes to China and very little goes to Europe. Chinese demand has actually increased as infrastructure spending has picked up, whereas in Europe demand has fallen sharply. In the coal market, Australia's exports have traditionally gone to Japan, Korea and Taiwan, where demand has softened. But increased demand in China (which traditionally imported very little coal) has partly offset the falls elsewhere. Indeed, in the past year, China's share of Australia's merchandise exports has risen sharply, and is approaching increased demand from China can be explained by the constructionintensive activity taking place there, and part by reduced Chinese production of iron ore and coal, as the fall in prices has seen some of the high-cost mines in China being closed. For both iron ore and coal, Australian companies are among the lowest-cost producers and so gain when higher-cost firms exit the scene. Factors such as this have kept Australian exports doing relatively well so far, and would seem to offer significant long-term opportunities, including for this region. The Australian economy has, nonetheless, been affected by the global recession, with real GDP, on the latest estimates, posting a small net decline over the past couple of quarters. The major driver of the slowdown has been weaker private domestic demand, most prominently a sharp decline in business investment spending, with a fall-off in housing construction. The fall in investment is best seen as the same understandable precautionary behaviour by Australian businesses as displayed by their counterparts around the world. A decline in business investment spending of about 8 to 10 per cent in the December quarter seems to have been a pretty standard result around the world. Macroeconomic policies have not been able to prevent an economic downturn. They rarely can, especially in the face of a global recession of this magnitude. Indeed, attempts to do so have as often as not run into trouble by stoking up bigger problems a few years down the track. But it is reasonable to think that policies can have the effect of making the downturn shallower than would otherwise have been the case, and that they can help to establish conditions conducive to recovery. The scope to implement such policy changes has to be earned during the expansion phase of the cycle. But Australia did earn that scope, and has been prepared to use it during the last six months. The Bank made a number of changes to its operations in financial markets to help keep them functioning through the worst of the crisis. Measures the Government took in this sphere were also important for confidence and access to funding. The Board also moved quickly to ease monetary policy after the events of mid September, with interest rates being reduced significantly. At 3 per cent, the overnight rate is at the lowest level seen since the early 1960s. This has fed through into significant declines in the rates paid by borrowers, especially, but not only, households. The debt-servicing costs of households have fallen faster and further than in previous cyclical episodes. The Board has not felt the need to cut our policy rate to the very low levels - effectively zero - seen in some other countries. There are two reasons. The first is that the situation we face is not as dire. The second is that the reduction in interest rates we have implemented has had a more direct effect on borrowers than in many other countries. The combined impact of the easing of fiscal and monetary policy is likely to be substantial. Quantification of the effects is very much a matter of informed judgment. The fact that Australia is experiencing, so far, a smaller downturn than most countries reflects in part the relatively smaller extent of the sort of financial excesses that have been the problem in some other countries, as well as the good fortune of our position in relation to China. But significant macroeconomic policy responses will have also played a role. Fiscal initiatives were not only sizeable by global standards, but implemented quickly. The impact of monetary policy easing in terms of reducing debt-servicing burdens for borrowers has been greater than in the major northern hemisphere countries. The relevant question now is: what are the prospects for a durable expansion? It is likely that activity has remained subdued in the June quarter. The rapid decline in business investment is almost certainly continuing. While consumer spending has held up quite well so far, it may be weaker over the next few months, as the one-off government payments pass and rising unemployment starts to weigh on incomes and willingness to spend. On the other hand, we are likely to see significant growth in public spending over the year ahead, reflecting fiscal policy decisions. Moreover, while it will be a while yet before the effects of lower interest rates and the boost to grants to first-home buyers are seen in data on construction work done, the pick-up in borrowing for housing that we have been seeing for about six months is what would be expected if an upturn in residential investment spending is to begin later in the year. Overall, then, our expectation remains that the economy will be well placed for expansion towards the end of this year. Initially it will be fairly gradual, in part because of the global factors to which I referred earlier. If so, the degree of spare capacity in the economy will tend to be increasing for a while, and inflation will most likely continue to decline for some time. That in turn means, as the statement following this week's Board meeting indicated, that some scope remains to ease monetary policy further, if that were to be helpful to securing a durable upswing. The emphasis on 'durable' is important. It is the intention of current monetary policy settings to lower debt-servicing costs, assist efforts to reduce leverage and support demand. It would be counterproductive, though, if further reductions in interest rates induced a large number of marginal borrowers into debts they could service only at unusually low interest rates. This is a reason for care, both by the Reserve Bank and private lenders, and I note that lenders are being a bit more conservative on non-price loan conditions for households. Picking cyclical turning points is notoriously hard - even in hindsight, let alone ahead of time. But I think Australia is as well positioned as any country, and better than most, to enjoy a new expansion. Longer term, there also is plenty to be positive about. There are good grounds to think that we can emerge from the current global recession with our economy largely free of the problems in the financial sector, the stresses on public finances and the general disillusionment facing a number of other economies. Keeping to prudent policy frameworks and settings, maintaining flexibility, focusing on productivity and pursuing the opportunities arising from the growing engagement with the Asian region will all be part of a prosperous future. This part of Australia is as well placed as any to play its part in that future.","['economy', 'townsville', 'economic', 'economies', 'macroeconomic']","['australian economy', 'industries townsville', 'international economy', 'townsville surrounding', 'economies keeping']","['region australian economy', 'industries townsville provides', 'set industries townsville', 'australian economy nonetheless', 'prosperous future australia']"
134,r090928a_BOA,australia,2009-09-28,NO_INFO,stevens,1,"Thank you Mr Chairman. I have just a few opening remarks. Economic conditions in Australia were generally quite subdued in the second half of 2008 and the first part of 2009. Output was sluggish, hours worked in the economy declined, unemployment rose and inflation started to abate. By the standards of past recessions, however, this was a mild downturn. Although the evidence is as yet incomplete, this episode has been much less serious than those in the mid 1970s, the early 1980s and the early 1990s. It also has been very mild indeed in comparison with recent outcomes in many other countries, where deep recessions have been experienced. For the G7 group of advanced countries, for example, a cumulative contraction in real GDP of nearly 5 per cent was experienced over the four quarters to June this year. The Australian economy recorded a small net expansion in GDP over the same interval. So I think it is reasonable to conclude, against the benchmarks of historical and international experience, that Australia has done quite well on this occasion. Why was that so? The key factors have been articulated before, but it may help to frame our discussion here today if I recount them. First, our financial system was in better shape to begin with, being relatively free of the serious problems the Americans, British and Europeans have encountered. Lenders have some problem loans, as always occurs during a downturn, but these are manageable. The banking system has continued to earn a positive return on its capital, unlike those in some key countries. The system has been affected by the spillovers from the global crisis, through tighter borrowing conditions in international markets, higher spreads and so on. But these too have been manageable and various policy responses have helped the system to cope. The Reserve Bank was prepared to expand its balance sheet to assist in maintaining liquidity and the government guarantees were important in shoring up confidence and maintaining access to wholesale funding. Second, some key trading partners for Australia have proven to be relatively resilient through this episode. The Chinese economy did slow sharply in the latter part of 2008, but quickly resumed very strong growth. China will easily achieve her 8 per cent growth target this year, led by domestic demand. Many of our other Asian trading partners have also returned to growth recently. Ongoing strength in demand for resources has kept Australian exports expanding. Australia's terms of trade, even though well off their peak, remain high by historical standards. Confidence about the future for the resources sector is building quite strongly. Finally, Australia had ample scope for macroeconomic policy action to support demand as global economic conditions rapidly deteriorated, and that scope was used. The Australian Government budget was in surplus and there was no debt, which meant expansionary fiscal policy measures could be afforded. In addition, monetary policy could be eased significantly, without taking interest rates to zero or engaging in the highly unconventional policies that have been necessary in some other countries. I have maintained throughout that Australia's medium-term prospects remained good and that we should not lose confidence. More people seem to be taking that same view. Measures of business and household confidence have shown a very substantial pick-up from the low points reached earlier this year. Share prices have risen by almost half. House prices have risen rather than fallen, though commercial property prices have fallen. People are realising that, though things have been tough, the worst has not occurred and the future is looking brighter. Earlier plans for drastic cuts to capital spending look like they are being reconsidered. Economic growth forecasts are being revised up. A straightforward reading of the economic outcomes would suggest that the various policy measures have been effective in supporting demand. In due course, both fiscal and monetary support will need to be unwound as private demand increases. In the case of the fiscal measures, this was built into their design. The peak effect of these measures on the rate of growth of demand has probably already passed. The extent of support will tend to tail off further over the next year. In the case of monetary policy, the Bank has already signalled that interest rates can be expected, at some point, to move off their current unusually low levels, as recovery proceeds. These adjustments back towards more normal settings for both types of macroeconomic policy are what should be expected during the recovery phase of a business cycle. Our most recently released set of forecasts assumes they occur. Such an outcome would mean that fiscal and monetary policy would be acting broadly consistently, as they did when they were moved in the expansionary direction when the economy was slowing. In both cases a degree of policy discipline will be needed. Policy frameworks will be valuable in enforcing that discipline. On the fiscal side, the forward estimates provide an indication of the restraint needed to move the budget back towards balance and eventual surplus over time, as required by the Government's medium-term fiscal commitment. On the monetary side, the inflation-targeting framework the Reserve Bank has been following for a decade and a half will guide adjustments to interest rates. These will be timely and ahead of a build-up of imbalances that would occur if interest rates were kept low for too long. These frameworks will, in other words, prompt the needed adjustments. It was the preparedness to make those adjustments in the past, guided by these very frameworks, that contained the build-up of imbalances in the upswing and which in turn earned us the scope to take bold measures to support demand when a recession loomed. A continuation of that approach into the future will serve us well.","['recession', 'recessions', 'macroeconomic', 'economy', 'economic']","['australian economy', 'recessions experienced', 'recessions mild', 'deep recessions', 'past recessions']","['year australian economy', 'australian economy recorded', 'economic conditions australia', 'deep recessions experienced', 'past recessions mild']"
160,r111208a_BOA,australia,2011-12-08,        ,stevens,1,"It is a very great pleasure, as a former student of Professor Warren Hogan, to give this lecture in his memory. Thank you to the Hogan family, many of whom are here this evening, and to the School of Economics at the University of Sydney for giving me this honour. recounting one or two personal reminiscences, it is appropriate to say something about his life. Many fascinating details of it are revealed in the interview with John Lodewijks, and the eulogy by Tony Aspromourgos, both fittingly published in the . Warren Pat Hogan was born in Papakura, just south his undergraduate and Master's education at Auckland University College, where he was taught by Colin Simkin, who later was also at the University of Sydney. He married Ialene, a fellow student in the same faculty, in 1952. Hence, it is not altogether surprising that Hogan's children seemed drawn to economics. Four of the five children, and several of the grandchildren, have degrees in economics. After gaining early work experience at the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, Hogan, with a young family in tow, came to Australia in the mid 1950s, where he in 1959, his research being on growth theory. His supervisor for that work was Trevor Swan, one of Australia's most renowned theoretical economists (and subsequently a member of the Reserve Bank Board). Ivor Pearce, with whom he would later collaborate in writing about international finance, was a close confidant and mentor. Among the early fruit of this work, as recounted in the Lodewijks interview, is that Hogan uncovered an error in a celebrated paper by Robert Solow. This led to an exchange between Hogan and the future Nobel Prize winner in the . Heady stuff indeed for a young graduate student from the antipodes. Hogan rose quickly through the ranks at Newcastle University College in the 1960s. But it was as Professor of Economics at the University of Sydney, for 30 years from 1968, that Hogan came to more prominence. Joined by Simkin, he sought to lift the technical standard of economics at the faculty, including by putting more emphasis on quantitative techniques. This met a good deal of resistance as part of the broader debates about how economics should be taught. By the time I was a student here from 1976 on, both sides seemed to have dug into the trenches and the dispute had been bitter. None of that stopped Warren Hogan from grappling with significant issues in economics or economic policy. In fact, Hogan's professional life shows an active mind always pursuing some important question. In a career that produced over 150 articles, books and chapters of books, and many shorter publications, he ranged broadly. As early as 1958 he was producing articles examining the rise of new financial intermediaries outside the regulated banking system - a theme about which we were still hearing in the 1980s, and one which should resonate today in light of the attention being given to 'shadow banks' and the expansion of the weight and width of the global regulatory footprint currently under way. Hogan retained an interest in both financial regulation and deregulation throughout his career, and married this with a nuanced understanding of the behaviour of financial players in their appetite for risk. Hogan also worked on issues of development in the emerging world, wages, immigration and transport. He served as economic adviser to one companies, most notably serving on Westpac's Board for 15 years, including through the period of deregulation and subsequent tumult. In his later years he conducted a major review of pricing in aged care. He also served in numerous capacities over the years in various university administrative positions and on other committees in the broader community. His was a full life indeed. It was in my third year at Sydney University that I think I first encountered Professor Hogan. This would have been in 1978. More than three decades after I sat in afternoon seminars conducted by him, the memories of his general style are clearer than the things he actually said. He was usually dressed in a suit - which would have been much more unusual for an academic in the late 1970s than it is now. The reason was perhaps that he had been in the city earlier in the day as he was active in dealing with practical policy issues and had links with the business world. On days when there might have been a nice business lunch, there was a certain relaxed expansiveness to his demeanour. He spoke often without notes on whatever economic topic we were covering, and as he spoke he would take the various coins from his pocket and arrange them into small piles on the table. We wondered what subconscious portfolio balance idea might have been behind that behaviour. Warren often had a somewhat elliptical way of saying things - you had to listen carefully to get what he may have really been saying, and sometimes you weren't sure you had understood correctly. As I reflect now on this characteristic, I wonder whether he missed a calling as a central banker! He certainly had built up contacts in the central banking world, as an occasional visitor to the BIS, where he was on very good terms with the late Palle Schelde Andersen, a renowned BIS economist and student of the international economy and financial system. I assume that their acquaintance was made in the late 1970s, when Andersen visited the University of Sydney for a period, funded by a grant from the Reserve Bank. One Hogan paper of that era that really struck a chord with me then - I have always recalled its title - was about the issue of revisions to economic These days the study of revisions to data is an art in itself (though the quality of national accounts data is better than it was in the 1970s). Central banks put huge effort into what has come to be called 'nowcasting' - that is, working out what the national accounts probably will, or should, say about the current quarter in three or four months' time when they are released. Some central banks actually 'backcast' the recent past, deciding their own version of GDP, not necessarily the same as the one published by the statisticians, in effect foreshadowing revisions to come. has not gone to that extent, though of course we have seen certain difficulties in assessing the current pace of underlying inflation in our own country over recent months, with reasonably significant revisions to some data series. So Hogan was on to something here - as far back as 1978. But the work on which I wish to focus for a brief period tonight is the book Hogan co-authored with Ivor Pearce entitled . Published first in 1982, with subsequent editions published in 1983 and 1984, this fascinating little book sought to explain the workings of the Eurodollar market and the institutions which operated in it. In the 1970s - the dataset on which Hogan and Pearce based their work - the Eurodollar markets were an exotic new development, spawned by a period of international financial turmoil and innovation, some of which was in response to regulation. The post-World War II compact known as the Bretton Woods system had held for about 20 to 25 years. This involved a US dollar standard, under which countries fixed, and occasionally adjusted, their exchange rates to the US dollar; the dollar was fixed to gold at US$35 per ounce; private capital flows were limited in scope; and official flows made major contributions, via the IMF, to international adjustment. But by the late 1960s and early 1970s, this arrangement had come under severe strain as private capital flows began to increase in size and US policymakers found they could not live with the constraints of the system. In a sequence of events, including the break of the link with gold and the decision by key countries to allow their currencies to float against the dollar, the system broke down. The result was a system in which exchange rates between the then major currencies have floated, with occasional efforts at management, ever since. The Eurodollar Market was in essence a pool of obligations issued by banks outside the US jurisdiction but denominated in dollars. It grew rapidly, apparently unconstrained by regulation conducted on a national basis (as all regulation was, and largely still is). It was part of a large increase in cross-border financing activity by internationally active banks. When Hogan and Pearce published their third edition in 1984, the stock of cross-border assets held by BIS reporting banks was about In the early 1980s, much of the talk about the Eurodollar Market was couched in terms of whether Eurodollar deposits should be added to measures of the money stock, which were the height of economic fashion at the time. As you will recall, this was the period in which the US Federal Reserve targeted monetary aggregates explicitly and in which weekly monetary aggregates data were scrutinised closely for signs about the likely direction of US interest rates. One can see this background quite clearly in Hogan and Pearce's little book, which has lots of discussion about whether Eurodollar deposits are 'money' (they thought not) or just 'debt' It was only a few years later that most countries gave up the effort to define 'money' and to conduct their policy discussion in terms of money aggregates, instead going back to the former model of setting a short-term interest rate. It is interesting, though, that in recent years the 'zero lower bound' for nominal interest rates, which as students we would have been taught about as 'the liquidity trap', is no longer a curiosity in the textbook from a bygone era, but has actually been binding in several major countries. One implication, among others, has been that calibrating monetary policy in terms of monetary quantities has come back into vogue in some places - this time with the relevant central banks consciously seeking to increase the size of their balance sheets. Whether the relationship between 'money' and nominal GDP or prices has become any more reliable than it was 25 years ago, when it was found too fluid to be useful for policy purposes, is not clear. But if the language in Hogan and Pearce's early 1980s work is, perhaps, a product of its times, some of the observations are astute, and there are some quite prescient insights. To begin with, Hogan and Pearce note that the activities of Eurocurrency markets - and we could generalise this to cross-border private financing generally - lessened the pressure on countries to adjust to current account imbalances, especially on the deficit side. This could be seen as good - allowing capital to flow more efficiently to the locations offering the highest risk-adjusted return. Or it could be worrying: the markets giving a nation more rope, so to speak, by allowing current account balances to become larger and more persistent than they would otherwise. Remember that at the time they wrote, current account positions had rarely been more than a few percentage points of GDP for any length of time, at least since 1945. The analysis of the mythical planet Htrae, with three countries Surplusia, Deficitia and Balancia, with respective currencies Surps, Defs and Bals, focuses on the operation of markets and, importantly, the role of financial institutions as intermediaries between savers in one country and borrowers in another. In the language of more recent times, financial institutions are key to the dynamics of so-called 'global imbalances'. Indeed, Hogan and Pearce state, rather bluntly: 'Financial intermediaries live upon imbalances'. At one level that is obvious - financial intermediaries or markets exist to transfer resources from savers to borrowers (and back again), which is to say that an imbalance between saving and investment at the level of an individual household or firm in the economy is matched against an equivalent imbalance of opposite sign in some other firm or household. The deeper sense in which this 'thriving' takes place in an international setting is that savers in one country lend their money to borrowers in another jurisdiction, about whom they know next to nothing, but feel safe in doing so because what they hold directly is an obligation of a large, well-known, globally active bank, assumed to be safe. But as Hogan and Pearce point out, a European entity raising dollars to fund a balance sheet does not have automatic access to a lender of dollars of last resort in the event that market conditions change. It is therefore exposed to serious funding risk in a way that does not occur in purely local currency operations. The average 'Eurobank' in the early 1980s had access to marks or francs - today euros - or pounds from its national central bank, but it could not be assumed that in times of stress these currencies could necessarily easily be swapped for dollars. In fact, this very phenomenon was at the heart of the crisis that began to unfold in 2007. It was in Europe, where banks had, and still have, a structural need for dollar borrowing to fund US dollar denominated assets, that the market strains first appeared in August 2007. As the crisis intensified, the need for access to central bank funding in dollars required a number of central banks to enter into swap arrangements with the US Federal Reserve so their domestic banks could borrow US dollars secured by local currency collateral. European banks were by far the largest users of these facilities - about US$400 billion was accessed via the ECB and other central banks in Europe at the peak in Of course, it is also in Europe that we have seen the epicentre of the most recent stage of the crisis. In some other respects, today's problems are a little different, and perhaps more complex, from those of three years ago. They arise from cross-border lending within a currency area that has a single money but very divergent experiences in terms of fiscal discipline and productivity, and that lacks a well-developed capacity for intra-area transfers - which is being built as we speak. Nonetheless, dollar funding for European banks has again tightened up and the swap lines among major central banks have setting potentially the most far-reaching is the set of proposals recently endorsed at the G-20 summit to mitigate the problems posed by institutions that are too big to fail at an international level, otherwise have been identified as fitting the criteria to be labelled G-SIFIs at present, though the list is not a fixed one: banks can enter and leave it over time. There will, in due course, be a framework for globally systemic insurance companies with parallel criteria. The intention of the policy is to make the failure of such entities less likely by requiring additional capital, and to make the consequences of failure less dramatic by developing better tools to resolve entities that have failed or are on the point of failure. The latter, in particular, is a very ambitious undertaking and contains some potentially far-reaching components - such as the ability to 'bail in' certain creditors to an institution on the point of failure, effectively turning them into shareholders, so as to lessen the likelihood that taxpayers will be called upon in such a situation. To make it work would require considerable co-operation across jurisdictions at moments where everyone's instinct is to protect creditors and counterparties in their own jurisdiction. I don't know what Hogan would have made of this. I suspect he would be wondering whether, if regulatory actions bind on one group of institutions, the behaviour in question would end up migrating to other, less-regulated places. This possibility is understood by the international regulatory community, which also has a regulatory agenda for 'shadow banking'. This is actually a critical point. I would offer the observation that, if we can get through the next year or so without a major crisis and successfully implement the various reforms - which might both be big 'ifs' - the next financial crisis may not occur in the same sorts of institutions as last time (or this time), but in different ones. It could well occur in institutions or markets that do not as yet exist. again been activated to assist. This is presumably designed to slow the speed of European bank deleveraging of dollar assets that would otherwise be forced to occur. Lots of people claim to have predicted the crisis, though I doubt that Warren Hogan, were he here, would claim that he and Ivor Pearce foresaw it in all its dimensions almost 30 years ago. I think they would perhaps claim that their saga of Htrae, where international cross-border financing ultimately produced a crisis, contained many relevant insights. I doubt that they fully appreciated the role that the financial institutions of the leading deficit country - the United States - would play in creating risk and transferring it elsewhere. In their story, the key institutions were those of the country of Balancia, where the international accounts initially were balanced. I think they would have expected the response of major central banks to the crisis to have resulted in more inflation than it has, so far. That may be a reflection of the inflationary times in which they were writing - when it seemed almost inconceivable that deflationary problems akin to the 1930s could re-emerge. The example of Japan, where there has been deflation for well over a decade, had not yet occurred in 1982. Of course, they might just have expected the inflation still to be coming. They would not be alone in that view. It is certain though that Hogan would have been watching all these developments with close interest. He would have been recognising certain things that he could have broadly predicted, and I suspect he would have said so with that very dry turn of phrase he had. He would also, surely, have been observing things that would have surprised him, and he would have been thinking about how his view of the world needed revision. He would have been pondering the future of the international financial system. In that vein, I shall use the remainder of the time this evening to make a few observations in that area. The first is that there is an extensive program of regulatory reform under way. In an international The key thing in avoiding disastrous crises in the future is less the specifics of regulation or resolution - as important as these are - than having a clear understanding of the nature and extent of risk-taking behaviour, in all its potential dimensions and locations. On my reading of Hogan's work, I believe he would have shared this view. Put in the simplest of terms, we might ask: where are financiers apparently making easy money? In what area of risktaking are the profits large or expected to be large? There is a good chance that it is there that, given enough time, the likelihood of excesses is greatest. In Hogan and Pearce's book, financial institutions and their behaviour were seen as central to the build-up of imbalances. But they are in one sense merely facilitating flows of capital that are reflective of other phenomena, resulting from the collective behaviour of the actors in surplus and deficit countries. So in contemplating the future of the international financial system, reforming the regulation of financial institutions, and understanding their behaviour, will be key, but it will be of equal importance to understand the underlying behaviour of the entities in the real economies. The role of official capital flows, in particular, is one element of the post-crisis world that seems to be becoming quite prominent. Indeed, perhaps one of the most striking features of the international financial system is the size of official reserve assets that have been accumulated by what Hogan and Pearce would have labelled 'Surplusia' - the countries that have run persistent current account surpluses. In the early 1970s, the accumulation of US dollars by surplus countries made for problems of monetary control in some large reserve holders finally broke down in 1973, total foreign reserves of all countries amounted to about 2 1/2 per cent of annual global GDP. West Germany's reserves were about 7 per cent of West German GDP. Today, total reserves in the world amount to the equivalent of about 15 per cent of global GDP, up from 10 per cent only five years ago. China's reserves are close to countries have equivalent ratios around 30 per cent or more; while, in Latin America, foreign exchange reserve holdings are typically in the 10-15 per cent range. There are numerous reasons behind this build up. The very high levels of energy prices in recent years have pushed up the reserves of oil producers, and this accumulation may have some logic as they seek to spread over a long period the income gains accruing from a finite resource. The reserves of many Asian countries have risen to much higher levels after the 1997 crisis, as a form of insurance against capital flow reversal. Indeed, the IMF advised this after the crisis, advice that has been taken to heart perhaps a little more than the Fund intended. One can understand the desire for self-insurance, and particularly as those Asian countries that had IMF programs in the late 1990s felt the conditions for mutual insurance - through the IMF - were very onerous. But the self-insurance provided by large holdings of reserves is costly, especially in the low interest rate environment we see in the major countries. Trillions of dollars and euros held on behalf of the citizens of countries across Asia (and elsewhere) are earning meagre returns and subject to increasing sovereign risk. This cost of self-insurance is therefore becoming increasingly apparent, a trend that will surely continue as, inevitably, Asian productivity levels continue to increase relative to the Western countries and their real exchange rates rise. Large centres of high saving with portfolios that are overweight in foreign assets whose return is low and whose value is highly likely to go down, measured in the currencies of the holders, amounts to something of a problem. Attempts by those holders to exit this position quickly would be, to say the least, highly disruptive. They know that and that is why they do not attempt it, though there is a degree of diversification under way. To paraphrase the old line, if I owe you a few billion, I may have a problem. If I owe you a trillion or two, you may have a problem every bit as big as mine. So there is a very long-term issue of portfolio rebalancing to be addressed here as well as one of structural realignment of national price levels (i.e. real exchange rates). At the same time though, there are increasing calls for the emerging economies with large surpluses and high reserve holdings to play a part in assisting Western economies facing budgetary and banking sector problems. With the balance sheets of many Western sovereigns already under pressure, there is hope for contributions from large reserve holders - they, after all, are the ones with the cash. It has to be observed, surely, that pressing reserveheavy emerging economies to lend into structures designed to smooth adjustment processes in the advanced world amounts to a call to perpetuate, to a fair extent and for at least a bit longer, some of the very 'imbalances' that so many have lamented for so long. What people are really saying is that they want to move only quite slowly away from the current constellation of resource flows and prices that, in other discussions, have been seen as constituting the problem. That may well be the best approach. But it is observable that large reserve holding countries are already getting uncomfortable with their degree of exposures to major Western governments. Hence, any offers of assistance are likely to be made with a careful eye to risk minimisation. This is likely to mean they will prefer to operate through international institutions, such as the IMF. Alternatively, they may prefer to take hard assets in return for their cash, rather than financial obligations, which, in turn, could easily raise the social and political tension level. At the very least, managing all this over the next decade will require level-headed analysis, far-sighted decisions on the part of national policymakers and a degree of international co-operation much greater than we usually see. Moreover, there will be some very important questions to be confronted. Not least among them will be that, with the relative economic weight of the emerging world rising quickly, and a rise in their financial weight flowing from their high rates of capital accumulation and increasing creditor status, they will expect an increased role in global financial governance as a condition of accepting more obligations to contribute to the global common good. The willingness of the established, post-war leadership countries to cede a degree of status and control to the emerging world will need to increase at the same speed as the emerging countries' willingness to grasp and accept their rising responsibilities. Will this occur? It is hard to judge. Much will depend on whether the various parties have the same general ideas about the purpose of the international monetary system. That is, at this point anyway, not clear. Another thing we might see is a certain tendency towards the financial repression that was a feature of the post-war world in which Warren Hogan first studied economics. A legacy of the 1930s was a much tighter regulatory regime for banks, elements of which lasted for decades. A legacy of the 1940s was a very large stock of government debt. Debt-to- GDP ratios were well into triple digits for countries for Australia). Yet from the 1950s through to the 1970s, debt-servicing dynamics were kept within manageable bounds. The rapid growth in economic output in the long post-war boom, which was aided by demographics and productivity performance, was a major help. But also contributing was a combination of central banks holding down longterm interest rates at government direction, and banks and other entities being forced to hold government debt. And of course, at the end of that boom, a period of unanticipated high inflation played a role in lowering debt-to-GDP ratios. In the current era, however, the rapid output growth will likely occur in the countries that don't have much government debt but do have productivity catch-up working for them, while in many of the countries that have a lot of debt the demographics will be going the wrong way. It is therefore conceivable that with slow-growing countries feeling pressed for solutions, regulatory actions might have certain attractions. Given this, and with many emerging countries having mixed feelings about many aspects of free financial markets anyway, it is conceivable that the current trend towards more assertive and intrusive financial regulation - which is occurring for very understandable reasons - will end up going much further than contemplated at present. The potential for an outcome that eventually involves significant inflation is also obvious. I have only touched the surface of many of these issues. As I said earlier, I cannot know what Warren Hogan would have thought of them, or whether he would agree with my views. I am sure, though, that he would have thought these matters worthy of further discussion and that he would have contributed to that discussion. Hopefully, I will have succeeded in stimulating some further discussion tonight. Once again, thank you to the University, and to the Hogan family, for permitting me this honour. I hope this marks the start of a successful series of lectures.","['hogan', 'economist', 'economics', 'professor', 'sydney']","['hogan studied', 'professor hogan', 'hogan children', 'hogan born', 'hogan family']","['hogan studied economics', 'warren hogan studied', 'professor warren hogan', 'university hogan family', 'professor hogan 1978']"
182,r140610a_BOA,australia,2014-06-10,        ,stevens,1,"The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco has long looked to the west, to the Pacific Basin. The Center for Pacific Basin Studies was established here nearly 25 years ago, and it was a professional highlight for me to be a visiting scholar here at the time. It is a particular pleasure to return to San Francisco to take part in this Symposium on Asian Banking and Finance. It is apt that the Symposium should focus on some of the regulatory challenges we are collectively seeking to address in the wake of the crisis of 2007-2008, and particularly welcome that it gives voice to partners from the Asian time zone. More than ever, finance has been global over the past couple of decades. That has brought many benefits but also certain vulnerabilities. It has also brought challenges for the regulatory community. There is a prodigious effort underway to work together to produce a regulatory framework that is genuinely international. Yet many important responses to the crisis are, and will remain, national. As such, they are at least partly driven by the circumstances and imperatives of the nations concerned. Nothing else could realistically be expected, but ensuring that all those national responses dovetail into a coherent international framework, and one that preserves what is good about globalised finance, is a difficult job. Moreover, the economic and financial importance of the Asian region is greater now than on past occasions when international regulatory standards were put together. So engaging Asia in the search for genuinely global approaches to regulation is important. To that end, the Financial Stability Board (FSB), and some of the standard-setting bodies that attend it, have adjusted their membership over the past five years in a way that recognises the importance of the Asian countries (and those of some other regions too). The FSB is currently undertaking a further review of the structure of its representation. It is nonetheless sometimes the case that the Asian members, and perhaps some other emerging market members, cannot avoid the feeling that the agenda is still driven by the major advanced economies. To the extent that those countries - the G7, say - are used to working together, and given that the financial crisis was so strongly centred in the north Atlantic countries' financial systems, perhaps that is no big surprise. However, while that historical cooperation is a strength on which to build, it is also important that the system we build looks forward, and acknowledges that much of the future growth will be in Asia. It is also important that those of us in the Asian time zone continue to strengthen our capacity to engage effectively in the international groups of which we now have the privilege and responsibility of membership. There are many components to the international agenda for regulatory reform. The G20 is the body that has accepted, or perhaps asserted, high-level oversight over these efforts. The FSB is the body that has accepted the task of trying to ensure a coordinated effort, respecting the integrity and independence of the standard-setting bodies and addressing risks itself where required. As you know, Australia has the responsibility of the G20 presidency this year. Australia is highly supportive of the way the Chair of the FSB has structured the efforts around four key themes. They are: Highlighting these four themes doesn't mean other things are forgotten. But it is an attempt to prioritise, to focus energies and to use the opportunity of the Leaders Summit in Brisbane, Australia, in November as a focal point for our efforts to get some important things across the line this year. The Basel III process is well on track. Most countries are well placed to implement the new international capital and liquidity standards in line with agreed timetables. Remaining policy details are being ironed out, with the leverage ratio requirement recently finalised, and further proposals on the net stable funding ratio released by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). The Committee is continuing its important work to address the excessive variability in the calculation of risk-weighted assets. On the question of capital standards, it is frequently claimed that pressing major banks to hold more capital will impair economic growth. There are two points to make about this. The first is that, in situations of acute capital deficiency, it is best to address the problem as quickly as possible. Consider the contrast between the United States and Europe over the past five years. In 2009, US authorities conducted a public stress-test exercise on the balance sheets of major US banks and insisted that, where the tests revealed weaknesses, banks strengthen capital positions. They could carry out this exercise confident that a backstop capital delivery mechanism, in the form of public injections of capital, was available if private capital was not forthcoming. But it has taken much longer to get to this position in Europe. There were stress tests in earlier years but they do not seem to have had the same credibility in the eyes of markets as those undertaken by the Fed in 2009. Moreover, Europe did not have a European public capital delivery device; it was left to individual national governments to address any need for that. It is apparent that, while American banks carried out balance sheet repair early, and have for some time been in a position to help the US economy in its recovery, European banks have, in aggregate, continued to seek to deleverage by lowering their risk-weighted assets. This cannot have helped the euro area's growth prospects. This is being rectified. Later this year the ECB will release the results of its Asset Quality Review, which should be a highly credible exercise. And Europe is in the process of building a single supervisory mechanism for large banks. Over time, though rather a long time, Europe is also committed to creating a single resolution capability and a Europe-wide capacity for injecting capital from a single resolution fund if needed. These are all important steps but the respective US and European experiences do, I think, show that prompt efforts to fix serious problems of capital deficiency are ultimately pro-growth. What about in more stable times? Can banks with more capital support growth as well as those with less capital? Equity is more expensive than debt for banks, and so a financial structure with more equity does mean, other things equal, that the cost of intermediation to the community is higher. Even without appealing to propositions of a Modigliani-Miller kind, which would dispute this assumption, the question is whether this apparently higher cost is a serious impediment to growth. Bankers often claim it is. The empirical estimates published by the FSB and BCBS suggest the effect is small, particularly when compared with the costs of large financial crises. Stepping back from that debate for a moment, and this is my second point, we might reflect on the following question: did the highly leveraged expansion of some parts of the financial sector in the period prior to the crisis really add much, sustainably, to growth? It is far from obvious that it did. It seems more likely, to me, that it was the other way around: a period of good global growth and, in particular, unusually stable growth, led to a rise in leverage. The reasons for that growth stability were mainly not, I suspect, things that happened in the financial sector. But people concluded that macroeconomic stability meant that higher leverage was safer than before. In acting on that conclusion, they inadvertently sowed the seeds of instability, since leveraged balance sheets left borrowers and lenders more exposed when an adverse shock occurred. The feedback effects from economic growth, or lack of it, to the capital positions of financial institutions are powerful. The big question is not, in fact, what more demanding capital standards will do to economic growth. The question is: what will economic growth, or lack of it, do to banks' capital positions? It is noteworthy in this context that the phase-in for the Basel III capital standards extends until 2019. One has to ask: how likely is it that we will go another five years without an economic downturn of some kind? Even if we do, even if we assume that growth in the United States and Europe extends to the end of this decade, by that stage these expansions would be fairly mature. Given that, one would hope that by 2019 major financial institutions would not only have reached new international minima for capital, but would have risen above them. One would hope that balance sheets by that time would be at their strongest position for the cycle. This is a reason to go faster, rather than slower, in accumulating capital to higher minima, while one can. This point is of some relevance to the discussion in my own country at present. On the second core regulatory theme of derivatives, efforts to achieve more reporting, more platform trading and more central clearing are running behind original timetables. That is in large part due to the complexity of the issues involved in crafting mutually consistent sets of regulations at the jurisdiction level, for a market that is highly globalised in operation. The regulations of the major jurisdictions - the United States and the European Union - have considerable extraterritorial effects. It is critical that there be a high degree of consistency if we are to avoid fragmentation and unnecessary cost. The smaller jurisdictions, such as my own, feel this acutely, but it is not just a concern for the smaller jurisdictions. Even large jurisdictions would bear costs from unnecessary fragmentation. What is needed is a good understanding in the various jurisdictions of each other's regulatory arrangements, and of the areas in which they can give recognition to those arrangements. But it takes more than just verbal commitments to the concept of mutual recognition to achieve this. It requires confidence that the application and enforcement of sets of rules in other jurisdictions, which have the same intent as one's own but which differ in precise wording or form, will in fact produce broadly equivalent outcomes. It takes time to establish that confidence, based on careful analysis, lengthy discussion and building of trust. Progress is now being achieved here, including between the two biggest jurisdictions. And the efforts of the authorities in the United States and the European Union to assess the regulatory arrangements in the various other jurisdictions, which is no small task, must be acknowledged. But we have a way to go yet. Progress could be improved if relevant international standards were the benchmark for assessments of regulatory equivalence, and if regulators clearly communicated the basis of their decisions and provided regulatory certainty by clarifying the scope for transitional relief in a timely manner. In respect of the third theme, there have been considerable efforts by the FSB and the standard-setting bodies to address the risks posed by shadow banking - those entities and activities beyond the perimeter of prudential regulation. As the crisis showed, this sector can be a source of systemic risk, especially in the jurisdictions where shadow banks account for a relatively large share of the financial system or are important in credit intermediation. Authorities also have to be alert to any new build-up in shadow banking risk resulting from the likely migration of some activities in response to tougher prudential regulation of banks. However, a balance needs to be struck. The jurisdictions where these problems are likely to be serious are few, and we do not want efforts to contain shadow banking activity unnecessarily to stifle genuinely productive intermediation and innovation. The FSB, International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and the BCBS have worked on addressing risks in several areas, such as money market funds, securitisation, banks' links with shadow banks and securities financing transactions (SFTs). Broad policy frameworks have largely been finalised in these areas, with work ongoing in relation to SFTs (such as an assessment of the impact of proposed recommendations). It has been important to retain a degree of flexibility in the policy recommendations, given that some shadow banking markets are relatively small and not likely to be a major source of systemic risk. On the fourth area, addressing the problem of 'too big to fail' entities, a key area of work this year is to put forward a proposal for 'gone-concern loss-absorbing capacity', or 'GLAC', for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). The idea is that, even though additional capital surcharges above the (now higher) standard Basel III minima make it less likely that a G-SIB could fail, they do not make it impossible. Such entities are sufficiently large and interconnected that an uncontrolled failure could easily cause systemic disruption. Therefore, it is argued that further loss-absorbing capacity is needed, to be called on at the point of non-viability, so as to allow vital functions to continue and non-critical operations to be wound down in a controlled way. This limits adverse spillovers to the system and the economy. Generally, this loss-absorbing capacity is to come from a 'bail-in' of certain classes of private creditors, so as to avoid calling on the public purse for a 'bail-out. This is an appealing idea, though it comes with the caveat that, to my knowledge, it has not successfully been done for a major institution to date. There are several important issues to resolve in the process of crafting a proposal. Among them are the questions of what instruments count towards any GLAC, how much GLAC may be appropriate, and what measures can be taken to mitigate risks of contagion from GLAC holders bearing losses. On the matter of what instruments should count, a key question is whether or not equity capital above regulatory minima should qualify. The view against doing so is that equity 'buffers' may turn out to be illusory in a stress situation. That is, the uncertainty over asset valuations may be such that a presumed equity buffer is not, in fact, there. The 'illusory capital' problem is certainly not unknown in the annals of crisis management. The alternative view, which, it is fair to say, is more widely held, is that not to count equity above minimum requirements as GLAC would act as a disincentive for banks to hold or maintain higher than minimum equity buffers. From a risk perspective, higher equity buffers are unequivocally a good thing. Such a disincentive would therefore be unhelpful. This view is held quite strongly in Asia where banks tend to have high levels of equity capital. Under this approach, concerns about 'illusory capital' could be addressed by enforceable triggers to allow early intervention when excess capital runs down to a point that breaches the GLAC requirement. Moreover, the more genuine equity a bank has, the more likely it can remain a concern in the face of a given shock. It would still need to have a degree of recapitalisation, by a share issue, and perhaps would need to call on contingent capital instruments, triggered by some sort of capital threshold. But that would be a recapitalisation as a going concern, not a resolution as a gone concern. One would have to have a lot of confidence in a resolution regime not to prefer working with an injured but still living G-SIB, as opposed to resolving a 'gone concern' one. There could still be a tail event big enough to exhaust even a higher level of equity in a G-SIB, therefore requiring resolution. And we might be uncomfortable about how quickly equity might be burned through in such an event, and we do want to be sure we can resolve a G-SIB. So some GLAC is helpful in that situation. Unless we have draconian capital standards for equity, some requirement for bail-in debt in addition to equity may well be sensible for G-SIBs. But overall it is appropriate, in my judgement, to allow equity capital in excess of regulatory minima to be counted towards GLAC requirements. Another important consideration is to mitigate the risk that imposing losses on holders of GLAC will trigger destabilising contagion among investors. Measures to protect against this risk could include: the subordination of all GLAC liabilities, to reduce creditor uncertainty about the position of GLAC liabilities in the hierarchy of claims; limitations on the term of GLAC liabilities, to guard against the potential for runs on GLAC; and measures to limit cross-holdings of GLAC by other financial institutions, to reduce the prospect of losses on GLAC holdings significantly weakening other parts of the financial system. We have seen that in times of uncertainty financial markets often shoot first and ask questions later, so the task of protecting against contagion should not be underestimated. These and other issues on GLAC will be debated over the coming months, with the intent to put a proposal to the G20 Leaders Summit in Brisbane in November, which would then go to public consultation and a Quantitative Impact Study. Other elements in addressing 'too big to fail' come under the heading of international cooperation, of a kind that goes beyond high-level statements of good intentions. By definition, the smooth resolution of a global systemically important bank would have to be an internationally cooperative one. Hence cross-border cooperation agreements, in which home and key host jurisdictions accept and agree to be bound by a framework setting out their obligations and rights, would be central. Settling these agreements is running behind the timetable originally envisaged, partly reflecting existing statutory hurdles to information sharing. Recognition of resolution actions taken in another country in respect of a G-SIB, which may involve stays of various kinds, would also be key. This will require, among other things, legislation in a number of jurisdictions. More generally, legislatures need to ensure that the relevant regulators have a mandate to cooperate effectively and share information with their counterparts elsewhere in the world and the legal tools to take part in relevant resolution actions. So there are a number of issues on which we need to make further progress by the time of the G20 Leaders Summit in November. It is to be emphasised that the work ahead is mainly not so much new regulation as the fulfilment of commitments already made, and made some time ago. What about beyond that? In particular, at what point does the agenda for better, and frankly more, regulation reach a natural conclusion? When does our focus shift from regulatory redesign, under the duress of a crisis, to operating the system in (hopefully) more normal times? And to evaluating how the strengthened regulations are working? I'm sure that is a question the regulated institutions ask. It is one the regulatory community asks as well. Central to addressing the question is the need to remember what we are trying to achieve. Put simply, we are applying the lessons learned during the crisis about the extent and nature of risk, the set of incentives that allowed it to build up, the channels of contagion for distress once the extent of risk became apparent, and the weaknesses in our collective capacity to manage a crisis when one emerged. This does not equate to a desire to eliminate all risk. In fact, risk-taking is, to a point, good. We want it to occur. That is how society advances. A problem right now, arguably, is that there is not enough genuine entrepreneurial risk occurring - judging by the low levels of private capital spending in many advanced countries. (That is a different thing from saying that there is not enough risk-taking occurring - various people argue that, in some respects, there is too much of that.) We do need, however, risk to be recognised, and we need to be clear about who bears it. Standard capital requirements are about ensuring shareholders accept the risks run by the firms they own. With appropriate capital structures, shareholders in financial institutions should be able to expect a reasonable, risk-adjusted, return - remembering that banking is a leveraged business and that when things go wrong the shareholders' return can quickly become a large negative. With additional loss absorbency requirements for G-SIBs, we are asking shareholders to internalise some of the externalities very large and complex firms create for the system in the event of distress. And with the GLAC requirements, we are asking some of the other creditors to accept the risk that they may, in the face of a truly exceptional event, in effect become equity holders as part of a resolution of a G-SIB. But the risk/funding cost curve is not linear, at least not over its entire length. At some point requiring more and more loss absorbency to be provided by the private sector will come at an increasingly steep price. There must be events sufficiently far into the tails of the relevant distributions that no private balance sheet can reasonably be expected, , to bear the associated loss, no matter what the price. Should such an event occur, policymakers will still face the decision of whether to close or support the institution. The policy task is not, in my view, one of ensuring that the probability of such an event is absolutely zero, but of making it acceptably low at an acceptable price. Most particularly, we need to prevent a recurrence of a situation in which outcomes that are not, in fact, especially remote put the system in need of a public rescue. It equally follows that we are not trying to extend the regulatory 'perimeter' indefinitely. There will always be some risky activity around the fringes of the system, and there is nothing particularly wrong with that. Those who seek high returns, and are prepared to accept the risk, should be allowed to do so. There is value in that occurring. The proviso is that as well as allowing such risk-takers to accept the rewards of their activities, we have to be able safely to allow them to wear the losses. We cannot have them generating significant spillovers to the parts of the financial sector that are publicly underwritten or that are key to the day-to-day functioning of the economy. Where such spillovers do exist, rules that serve to isolate the risk-taking activities, to keep them genuinely on the fringe, are in order. This is perhaps the greatest regulatory challenge for the future: assessing when an activity that is technically outside the 'perimeter' might be about to present a threat to overall stability. Devoting a lot of resources to ever greater refinements to the details of existing regulatory structures will not help us do that. Having the big things inside the perimeter about right should be good enough. After that, we need to make sure we devote adequate resources to keeping a general weather eye on the broader situation, beyond just the area illuminated around our current lamp post. With the pace of technological change, it probably will not become easier to do that. The possible rise of 'virtual' currencies, the potential for the distinction between regulated financial institutions and, say, telecommunications and technology companies to become blurred, to name just two developments, may pose challenges. They doubtless will not be the only ones. It probably will still pay dividends, though, to keep our antennae tuned for the nature of the promises made by the various players, the extent of leverage involved and the frequency with which we hear the cry that 'this time is different'.

259,r201116a_BOA,australia,2020-11-16,"        COVID, Our Changing Economy and Monetary Policy",lowe,1,"Thank you very much for the invitation to speak at CEDA's annual dinner. After so many webinars and Zoom meetings, it is great to be able to be here in person. 2020 has been a year like no other and one we will never forget - a global pandemic, the closure of our borders, the biggest economic downturn in nearly a century, a very large budget deficit, interest rates down to zero and QE by the RBA. None of this was expected at the start of this year. Unfortunately, it guarantees that 2020 will be a year that is talked about for decades to come. Yet through these difficult times, the underlying strengths of the Australian economy and people have been on display. Our economy has performed better than many others in challenging circumstances. We have had more success in containing the virus than many other countries. Australia's public institutions have worked effectively and constructively together. Our public sector balance sheets are strong and have been used to good effect to cushion the shock. Our financial institutions have also helped people and businesses manage their mortgages and their debts. And Australians across the country have reacted sensibly and worked together to contain the virus. So, even though we have had our challenges and setbacks, we do have a lot to be thankful for. Notwithstanding this, a year like the one we are living through will inevitably leave some marks on our economy and on economic policy, including on monetary policy. Tonight I would like to talk about some of these. In terms of the economy, I am going to touch on five areas where the pandemic is leaving a mark. The first is that it has brought an end to Australia's nearly three decade-long run without a recession. This was an impressive record and it is one that will not easily be broken by us or by others. We are now, though, having to adjust to a new reality. The level of output in Australia fell by a record 7 per cent in the June quarter and over 2020, we are expecting GDP to decline by around 4 per cent (Graph 1). In the RBA's central scenario, we are expecting growth of 5 per cent next year and 4 per cent over 2022. These are fast growth rates, but because of the size of the fall in the first half of this year it will take until the end of 2021 for us to reach the level of output at the end of last year. This downturn has taken a heavy toll on our labour market. Hours worked in Australia fell 10 per cent between March and May and the unemployment rate has risen to 6.9 per cent, with underemployment even higher. We are expecting the unemployment rate to rise further over coming months to a little below 8 per cent. In our central scenario, we expect it then to start gradually declining, but still be a little above 6 per cent at the end of 2022 (Graph 2). One consequence of this higher unemployment is that wage and price pressures are likely to remain subdued. In each of the next two years, we are expecting annual wages growth of less than 2 per cent. And inflation, in underlying terms, is expected to be just 1 per cent next year and It is certainly possible that the economy will do better than this baseline scenario. The recent data have been better than expected and the easing of restrictions has lifted spirits. Further good news on a vaccine and rapid testing would also help. There is a lot of stimulus in the system, balance sheets are generally in good shape and governments are providing substantial incentives for firms to invest and employ people. So if we do get further good news on the health front, we could have a rapid rebound. At the same time, it is still possible that we experience further outbreaks. And the hoped-for medical advances may be delayed and could face production and distribution challenges slowing their rollout. This means that there are downside scenarios too. So there is still considerable uncertainty about the outlook. It does, though, seem highly probable that one of the marks the pandemic will leave is an extended period of higher unemployment than we have become used to. Addressing this is an important national priority. A second area where the pandemic has left a mark is the sharp decline in population growth. Over the past two decades, Australia's population grew at an average annual rate of 1 1/2 per cent (Graph 3). But in 2020/21, it is expected to increase by just 0.2 per cent. This will be the slowest rate of increase since 1916, when many Australians left our shores to fight in the First World War. The fast population growth of recent decades has been a major factor shaping our economy. It has underpinned our relatively fast growth in GDP compared with other advanced economies. It also slowed the ageing of the population, given that the new arrivals have been fairly young. The large number of students coming to Australia has also boosted our education sector. And the effects of fast population growth have also been felt in our housing market and in pressure on some of our infrastructure. So the effects have been widespread. Looking to the future, it remains hard to predict when the borders will open again and when they do, what the rate of new arrivals will be. If population growth is to be noticeably slower in a post-COVID world, the trajectory for our economy will look different too. A third area where the pandemic is having a marked effect is on our property market. It is a complex picture here, with the market simultaneously adjusting to: a recession; lower population growth; record low interest rates; substantial government incentives to support residential construction; and changes to the way that people work, shop and live. So there are a lot of moving pieces at present and the effects are very uneven across different types of property and across the country. The effects of the pandemic are most obvious in the market for retail properties in our CBDs, where vacancy rates have increased sharply (Graph 4). Not surprisingly, rents and the capital values of these properties have both fallen. There has also been an impact on the CBD office market, as people work from home. The national office vacancy rate has increased sharply this year and further increases are expected (Graph 5). But even here, there is considerable variation across our cities, with the biggest increase in CBD office vacancies in Sydney and Melbourne. In contrast, the markets for industrial property have been stronger, with increased demand for warehousing and distribution facilities as people increasingly shop online. The residential market is also a mixed picture. Our biggest cities have been more affected than others by the slowdown in population growth. They have also been more directly affected by the virus. As a result, prices in Sydney and Melbourne have fallen over recent months, while they have risen in most other cities. It is also noteworthy that in some states, the markets in our regional towns and cities have been stronger than those in the capital cities. For example, while prices have fallen in Sydney they have increased in regional NSW (Graph 6). Many regional centres have been less affected by the virus and some are experiencing increased demand as people work remotely and look for property outside the big cities. Within the capital cities, the markets for houses and apartments are also performing quite differently. In most cities - especially Sydney and Melbourne - rents for apartments are falling, while rents for houses are generally rising (Graph 7). The apartment markets are more affected by the lower population growth and fewer foreign students and by young adults staying at home with their parents. There has also been an increase in demand for houses as people work from home. As I said, it is a complex picture and the full effects of the pandemic will take time to be evident in our property market. To date, the demand from investors in residential property has been subdued, but it is possible that low interest rates will change this. This is one of the many areas that we will be watching carefully in the period ahead. The fourth area where the pandemic is likely to leave a mark is on our attitude to risk. While it is not possible to be definitive here, I expect that for a time, people will be more cautious in their borrowing and spending decisions. As we all know, 2020 has been a sobering year. Given this, it is probable that some people will want bigger buffers in future in case things go wrong. They might also be less inclined to lever up and be more cautious in taking on debt. At the same time, though, it is important that we guard against becoming too risk averse. Over the past decade or so, there have been signs that our economy was becoming less dynamic. An increase in risk aversion would reinforce this trend. We all know that businesses need to take risks to innovate and grow. I understand that in an uncertain world, it can be hard to take on risk and there can be a natural tendency to avoid new risks. But, if businesses are to seize the opportunities that are out there to grow and to increase Australia's productive capital base, some degree of risk-taking is necessary. Another area we will be watching carefully is how people adjust their portfolios as they search for yield in a low interest rate environment. Some people will no doubt move out along the risk spectrum. As they do so, the additional investment risks will need to be understood and managed. A fifth area where the pandemic is leaving a mark is in the digitalisation of our economy. In some areas, progress that otherwise would have taken years has been made in a matter of months. The combination of necessity, new technologies and the easing of regulations has made a real difference. Digitalisation is not only helping Australians deal with the pandemic, but it will also boost productivity and can help drive future economic growth. Examples of this include the uptake of telehealth and the availability of electronic prescriptions. Companies can also now hold AGMs virtually and more legal documents can be executed electronically. Many people are also benefiting from not having to travel as much for work and for meetings. For some, the time that they would otherwise have spent sitting in cars or on public transport and planes can now be used for more productive or rewarding activities. There has also been very rapid growth in online retailing, with many people shopping online for the first time (Graph 8). Reflecting this, online retail sales have increased by 80 per cent since the start of the year. The shift to doing things differently is also evident in the payments data, where there has been a marked increase in the use of electronic forms of payment. One side effect of this is that the use of banknotes for transactions has declined considerably, with the value of cash withdrawals falling by This acceleration in the shift to a more digital economy is prompting firms to innovate and to find new ways of doing things. They are having to compete to come up with new products and new ways of delivering them. This innovation and competition will have a positive payoff for our economy. It will take time to realise the full benefits, but as businesses are re-engineered to become more digital we will all see the benefits in terms of higher productivity. On that positive note, I would now like to turn to economic policy, where there have been major changes too. On the fiscal front, fiscal policy has taken on a greater role in macroeconomic stabilisation than was the case prior to the pandemic. This is entirely appropriate and reflects both the size and nature of the shock that we have experienced and the limits on monetary policy in a low interest rate world. This change has been accompanied by a shift in the government's broader fiscal strategy. The first stage of the revised strategy is to support the economy and jobs and promote economic growth until the recovery is assured. This focus will remain in place until the unemployment rate is comfortably below 6 per cent. This is a form of forward guidance familiar to central banks. In the longer run, the strategy will shift to stabilising and reducing debt as a share of GDP. Doing this will provide greater flexibility to respond to future shocks, wherever they come from. The key here is to ensure a strongly growing economy, so we need to focus on the reforms and innovations that will deliver this. There have also been changes on the monetary policy front. I would like to highlight four. The first is the nature of the RBA's own forward guidance. In the past, our forward guidance about interest rates was forward looking - we have focused on the outlook, or forecast, for inflation. This was a sensible approach when the inflation dynamics were stable and predictable. But the combination of globalisation and technology and now the pandemic have changed these dynamics. Labour markets are working differently than they used to and wage and inflation dynamics have changed. This has made relying on forecasts more difficult. Given this, we have now moved to place much more weight on actual outcomes, rather than forecast outcomes, in our decision-making and in our forward guidance. As an example of this, in our communication after the most recent Board meeting we said 'the Board will not increase the cash rate until actual inflation is sustainably within the 2 to 3 per cent target range. For this to occur, wages growth will have to be materially higher than it is currently. This will require significant gains in employment and a return to a tight labour market.' This forward guidance is in contrast to the earlier approach, which emphasised our expectation of future inflation. A second and related change has been a shift in the relative weight given to jobs and inflation in our communication. The mandate of the Reserve Bank of Australia was established by Parliament back in 1959 and the central elements have remained unchanged since then. Our mandate is to promote price stability, full employment and the economic welfare of the Australian people. This mandate is broader than that given to most other central banks, with Australia not swinging with the fashion over recent decades to adopt a singular focus on inflation. My view is that this broader mandate has served the country well and that it is especially relevant in today's world. In particular, the challenge facing Australia over the next few years is much more likely to be the creation of jobs, rather than controlling inflation pressures. So that is our focus too. The Board wants to do what it can, with the tools that it has, to support the national effort to reduce unemployment. This does not mean that we are backing away from the inflation target. As Australia's central bank, we will continue to provide a strong nominal anchor through the 2 to 3 per cent medium-term flexible inflation target. We remain committed to achieving this target. The best way to do this is through reducing the spare capacity that currently exists in the economy. And this starts with getting people back into jobs. If this can be done we will get closer to both full employment and the inflation target and enhance the economic welfare of the Australian people. The third change to monetary policy is a strengthening in the gravitational pull of low global interest rates. A decade ago, world real interest rates fell sharply in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. Around the world, people wanted to save more and invest less. The inevitable result was that the return to savers fell. Given that Australia is part of the interconnected global financial system, we felt the effects of this here too. Even so, our interest rates did not fall as far as they did elsewhere due the combination of the resources boom, our relatively strong economy and higher levels of investment in Australia. This year, the pandemic has brought another major shock, with investment intentions falling further. As a result, global interest rates and the return to savers have also declined. The gravitational pull of this on our own interest rates has been very strong. The RBA has responded to this, with the policy rate now essentially zero in Australia, as it is in many other countries. If we had sought to ignore this gravitational pull, there would have been obvious implications for our exchange rate and our economy. If our interest rates were higher than in the major countries there would be stronger inflows into Australian dollar assets and this would put upward pressure on our exchange rate. In turn, this would make it harder to make the needed progress on jobs. Over the medium term, I do expect to see a time when Australia's strong economic conditions once again justify higher interest rates. But today, during a global pandemic when a lot of people have lost their jobs and many businesses are struggling, is not the time for that. The fourth and final change on the monetary front is the return to a world in which quantities, not just prices, matter. Over recent decades, monetary policy has been about the price of money, or the short-term interest rate. Little attention was paid to the quantity of money. This has now changed, with the RBA now undertaking QE, or quantitative easing, as many other central banks are also doing. Quantities and prices are obviously connected, so QE works partly through affecting the price of money, including long-term risk-free interest rates. But there are other effects too. When the central bank increases the quantity of money and buys assets, liquidity in the financial system is increased and investors in the private sector need to purchase other assets with the proceeds of the bonds they sell to the central bank. These portfolio adjustments can affect the price of other assets and international capital flows, as well as the exchange rate. We are still learning about how strong and durable these transmission mechanisms are, and we will learn more over coming months as we implement our own $100 billion QE program. To conclude, 2020 has been a year of great change and disruption. We are all talking about issues that few of us even contemplated at the start of the year. Australia is managing well in these challenging circumstances and I expect it to continue to do so. The pandemic has been difficult for many people and businesses, but we are now on the road to recovery. As we travel along that road we will see some changes in our economy and there will be new opportunities as well. As we make that journey, economic policy will also continue to adjust to our changing circumstances. Thank you for listening. I look forward to your questions.","['australians', 'pandemic', 'recession', '2020', 'australian']","['australian economy', 'australia managing', 'increase australia', 'investment australia', 'decades australia']","['facing australia years', 'australia year pandemic', 'australia managing challenging', 'australia strong economic', 'australian economy people']"
402,r041007a_BOC,canada,2004-10-07,Global Economic Developments and the Implications for Ontario,dodge,1,"Governor of the Bank of Canada  Good afternoon. I am glad to be here, and to participate in this very important summit. It's not easy to come up with something fresh to say this late in the conference agenda. My topic is ""Ontario's Place in the World,"" but, of course, you've already spent a day and a half listening to the opinions of smart people who spend a great deal of their time studying this very subject. You've discussed at length the forces at play in the world economy, and how they are influencing Canada's economy and, of course, the economy of Ontario. Unfortunately, I have not been able to attend the entire event, so I have missed hearing many of the interesting speakers and presentations that have gone before. So, to contribute to this discussion about Ontario and its place in the world, I thought that I would begin by giving you a brief synopsis of what I heard this past weekend at the meetings of the G7 and the International Monetary Fund in Washington. I'll recap what was said about the challenges facing the global economy, both over the next year and further out over the medium term. Then, I will talk about how those themes and their implications relate to the Ontario economy. One theme that I heard repeatedly in Washington is that 2004 is turning out to be a better year than many had thought, particularly over the first half of the year. Indeed, the IMF is now projecting global economic growth of 5 per cent in 2004, which would be a marked improvement from the 3.9 per cent rate seen in 2003. Globally, while the United States continues to be an important source of growth, it is encouraging to note the very strong growth in Asia and the improved momentum in Europe. There have been a few factors underpinning this growth, including a still-favourable financing environment, and a general improvement in the banking sector and in private sector balance sheets and profitability. The outlook for consumption and investment in most countries continues to be good. This outlook bodes well for the rest of this year and 2005, even though there was a sense at the meetings that growth over this period will not be quite as strong as we saw in the  first half of 2004. The IMF's own forecast, for example, pegs global growth for 2005 at 4.3 per cent--still above the trend rate, but off a bit from 2004. However, this optimistic outlook came with a clear caveat. The balance of risks for the global economy in 2005 has shifted slightly to the downside. Let me briefly mention some of the risks that were talked about. There was a general sense that the sharp rise in oil prices could become a more significant drag on growth next year, particularly if prices were to stay at current levels. Higher oil prices have cut into the rate of economic growth, but the consensus is that, so far, the overall effects appear to be manageable. Geopolitical events remain a risk to the world economy. As well, we are beginning to see the potential for inflationary pressures in some countries, as economies approach the limits of their production capacity. The challenge for monetary authorities will be to manage the transition from a very low interest-rate environment to one where policy rates are somewhat higher. Looking beyond 2005, there was a general consensus that economic policy-makers around the world need to move ahead with addressing the problems that the global economy will face. So let me now take a few minutes to discuss what was said about the medium-term challenges for the global economy. In 2006 and beyond, a key concern will be how economies will adjust to the current global economic imbalances. A large U.S. current account deficit has its counterpart in the large current account surpluses in almost every other region of the world, most notably in Asia. At the same time, we have seen a sharp rise in the net foreign liability position of the United States and a massive accumulation of foreign exchange reserves by the Asian countries. Looking forward, the U.S. current account deficit is likely to continue to deteriorate, and current account surpluses in emerging Asia may remain larger than desired for longer than desired. For now, there is no reason to believe that world capital markets cannot manage these imbalances. But, over the longer haul, the magnitude of these current account imbalances cannot continue, and no country can pile up foreign exchange reserves indefinitely. Global adjustment will be needed to restore balance. This global adjustment could take place in several ways and through several channels. Hopefully, these will allow the adjustment to take place in an orderly way. The first channel is through changes in the global pattern of savings and consumption. Domestic savings in the United States could rise--both government and household savings rates can be expected to head up. And foreign consumption could increase, as economies and markets continue to expand.  It is worth noting that in North America, household consumption is running well over 60 per cent of GDP. As we look ahead, and take into account the aging population, it is important that savings rates increase in North America. At the same time, household consumption in emerging Asia is only about 40 per cent of that region's GDP. As Asian incomes rise, there is great potential for household consumption in that region to increase. So these are natural forces that will be working towards the adjustment of these imbalances. The second channel for adjustment will undoubtedly involve changes in real exchange rates; that is, the relative value of currencies taking into account the effects of inflation. Changes in real exchange rates could come about either through movements in relative inflation rates, or movements in nominal exchange rates, or some combination of the two. With respect to nominal exchange rates, the big issue is the need for some effective depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the currencies of emerging Asia. A key element here is China's fixed exchange rate, and how successful the Chinese authorities will be in meeting their stated goal of moving to a floating currency. In all likelihood, both of these channels of adjustment will play some part in facilitating the correction of global imbalances. As these adjustments take place, two things will be critical to ensuring that real incomes continue to rise worldwide. First, global trade flows must continue unimpeded. That is why we must push for continued progress at the Doha Round of trade negotiations under the World Trade Organization. It is also why we must fight against any outbreak of protectionism. Second, all economies must take steps to enhance their flexibility so that the adjustment doesn't have to take place through loss of real incomes. Here in Canada, we have to continue to increase the flexibility of our markets for goods and services, for capital, and crucially, for labour. At the same time, all of us leaders of corporations and public sector institutions must work to enhance the productivity of our workplaces. That leads me to the issues that we have to consider here in Ontario. The remainder of my remarks today will deal with these issues. Now, as I mentioned, I was not able to participate in your earlier discussions about the structure of Ontario's economy. But, having outlined the forces that the international experts believe will be at work in the years ahead, let me now spend a few minutes talking about the competitive and structural issues that we face here at home in light of these global forces. Experience has taught me that one has to be very careful in trying to predict exactly how structures in an economy are going to evolve. But I think that we can safely predict that the first and most obvious adjustment will be a transformation of manufacturing processes around the world, as low-cost, highly efficient capacity is built in Asia. This means tremendous and continuing competitive pressure on industries that have traditionally been mainstays of the Ontario economy--automobiles and parts, other  transportation equipment, and some areas of light manufacturing. Over time, those pressures will increasingly be felt by industries such as steel and heavy manufacturing. There are no signs that these pressures will abate in the years ahead. A second adjustment will be to higher energy costs in the years ahead. This is a major issue for all countries, and poses a problem for Canada and Ontario, which are energyintensive by world standards. But energy cost increases and supply concerns are not limited to oil and natural gas. The blackout of August 2003 was a spectacular example of the need to have adequate and failsafe electricity supplies. We know that our electricity supplies are often stretched to the limit. And we know that demand in Ontario will continue to grow in the future, and that there is no clear plan to replace the capacity that has been slated for closure. A third adjustment relates to non-energy commodities. Strong demand from the booming economies of Asia is behind the rise in non-energy commodity prices such as nickel and iron ore. In response, we are seeing significant efforts in countries around the world to find new sources for these commodities and to improve their efficiency in extracting them. This province's commodity producers must take advantage of this healthy environment to boost their own productivity to meet new competitive challenges. Fourth, we are in the process of adjusting to the fact that services, once thought to be non-tradable, are increasingly open to worldwide competition because of changes in technology. Ontario's service-producing industries are facing increased competitive pressure from new suppliers, such as India's burgeoning information technology and business services industries. All indications are that this pattern will continue, and will be repeated in other service industries. Perhaps the biggest challenge for Ontario's service sector will be from the continued consolidation within financial services industries around the world. This poses a real competitive challenge to the financial services industry that is so important to the Greater Toronto Area. Indeed, while financial services companies may be concentrated around Toronto, they are important to the whole province--the finance, insurance, and leasing sector represents almost 15 per cent of Ontario's GDP. All these competitive challenges are compelling Ontario's businesses, politicians and policy-makers to find ways to increase industrial productivity and market efficiency. Let me just stop for a second, because what I've said so far may sound overly negative about Ontario's economic prospects. We need to keep in mind that changes in the global economy are also creating income and wealth in China and India, thus increasing their demand for goods and services from abroad. These emerging markets are just that-- markets. This source of growing demand can provide a boost to the global economy in general, and the Ontario economy in particular. Now, in the past two days, you have heard from people who are far more expert than I am about how individual sectors can meet this competition and take advantage of these  opportunities. So I'm not going to try to add my own specific policy prescriptions to the debate. But I would like to point out some issues that I believe must receive considerable focus in order to position Ontario to meet the global challenges facing us over the medium term. The first is the need to improve the efficiency of labour markets and the quality of Ontario's human resources . This is a critical element of Ontario's ability to meet future competitive challenges. To develop the skilled workers that this province will require to meet its labour demands, Ontario must ensure that its education and training systems are second to none. This applies to early childhood education and development, the provincial school system, and post-secondary education and skills training. And all employers, both public and private, have a responsibility to provide their workers with opportunities to upgrade their skills. Appropriate investment by individuals, by employers, and by governments, will be needed. But even the best-educated and trained workforce will still face inevitable economic adjustment that will lead to displacement and additional bur dens on some groups in society. This does not mean that we should shy away from the task. But it does mean that a second area of focus should be to have policies in place that help to smooth the adjustment . These include providing access to training, or helping workers relocate or shift into expanding areas of the economy. The third area would be to improve the efficiency of capital markets and the financial system in Ontario and Canada. We all know that an economy works better when its financial services sector is sound and efficient. A robust and well-functioning financial system is key, so that growing firms have access to credit, and savings can be efficiently recycled to help businesses expand. Now, I am not here with a prescription for what needs to be done in this area. But we must not lose sight of the fact that the financial sector is an important contributor to economic growth in Ontario. An efficient financial sector will continue to be a competitive advantage for this province, both in maintaining efficiency in our own market, and in providing an opportunity to export expertise around the world. So policymakers have an interest in providing a framework that will allow our financial institutions and markets to compete in an increasingly globalized world. With global standards evolving rapidly, Canada and Ontario must be at the forefront in terms of efficiency and competitiveness. A fourth area of focus is the province's infrastructure --it needs to be a contributor to industrial efficiency, not an impediment. An important part of this is transportation infrastructure. And this applies not only within the province, but also to the links with our trading partners in other provinces, other parts of North America, and overseas. But it is not just physical infrastructure that is important. We also need the right policy infrastructure in areas such as security, inter-provincial trade, and regulation. For example, as industries increasingly rely on just-in-time delivery, border delays can cause real damage to businesses. That is why it is critical to develop and maintain border  crossings that are as safe as these times require, yet open enough to allow the rapid flow of goods and people. The fifth issue would be securing reliable sources of cost-effective energy for the future. Ways must be found to foster the development of new sources of energy and to provide the right incentives for the efficient use of that energy. Clearly, there is a need for an appropriate framework to encourage investment in electricity transmission and generation, including renewable energy and alternative technologies. So those are five critical elements that I see as part of Ontario's efforts to meet the challenges that lie ahead , and to take advantage of the opportunities presented by growing world markets. It is by no means a comprehensive list. There are many other important issues that I have not discussed. But I have tried to point out five areas that, in my opinion, policy-makers and business leaders cannot ignore. We know that the challenges facing our economy will not be easy to meet. We know that tough choices will have to be made to secure an economic framework that enhances Ontario's efficiency and its flexibility. We know that the burden of adjustment will fall disproportionately on some individuals and groups and that we have a collective responsibility to help with that adjustment. But we also know that Canadians and Ontarians have made tough choices in the past that have proved right. These choices have yielded an economy that is resilient, and capable of competing with the best in the world. That tradition must continue. The choices Ontarians make in the years ahead will determine our ability to meet the challenges thrown at us by this changing world economy, and to seize the opportunities that growth in world markets will bring. This province has tremendous human and natural advantages. I am confident that it also has the will to make the choices that will help Ontario thrive in this new world economy.","['ontario', 'provincial', 'toronto', 'economy', 'province']","['canada economy', 'ontario economy', 'discussion ontario', 'influencing canada', 'ontario economic']","['ontario meet global', 'influencing canada economy', 'economy general ontario', 'general ontario economy', 'ontario economy theme']"
405,r041026a_BOC,canada,2004-10-26,Opening Statement before the House of Commons Finance Committee,dodge,1,"Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee. We appreciate the opportunity to meet with this committee twice a year, following the release of our . These meetings help us keep Members of Parliament and, through you, all Canadians informed about the Bank's views on the economy, and about the objective of monetary policy and the actions we take to achieve it. Since we last met, we are pleased to have issued Canada's new $20 bank note with enhanced security features. The new note began circulating on 29 September. Last Thursday, we released our October , which reviews economic and financial trends in the context of Canada's inflation-control strategy. When Paul and I appeared before this Committee last April, we told you that the economy was judged to be operating significantly below its potential. That is no longer the case, because the Canadian economy has grown faster than was projected in last April's and the July . This stronger growth was largely due to a surge in exports. The economy is now operating near its production capacity and continues to adjust to global economic developments. The Bank's base-case projection for the period to the end of 2006 calls for aggregate demand for Canadian goods and services to expand, on average, at about the same rate as potential output. Given the effects of higher oil prices and the past appreciation of the Canadian dollar, the Bank projects economic growth to be slightly less than 3 per cent in 2005, and slightly more than 3 per cent in 2006. With the economy expected to remain near its production capacity throughout this period, core inflation is projected to move back up to the 2 per cent target by the end of 2005. That is the same projection that we made last April. However, given the path suggested by futures prices for crude oil, the Bank expects total CPI inflation will rise to the top of the 1 to 3 per cent target range in the first half of 2005, before falling slightly below core inflation in early 2006. Against this background, the Bank raised its target for the overnight rate to 2.5 per cent on 19 October. The base-case projection assumes further reduction of monetary stimulus over time, to keep the economy near its production potential and to achieve the inflation target. I want to emphasize that the pace of interest rate increases will depend on the Bank's continuing assessment of the prospects for factors that affect pressures on capacity and, hence, inflation. There are significant risks and uncertainties around this base-case projection, related to the adjustment to changes in the global economy, including changes in commodity prices and exchange rates. The risks surrounding global economic prospects relate primarily to the evolution of oil prices, the pace of expansion in China, the way in which current account imbalances in the United States and East Asia will be resolved, and geopolitical developments. Mr. Chairman, Paul and I now will be happy to answer your questions.","['monetary', 'inflation', 'bank', 'economy', 'cpi']","['canada inflation', 'canadian economy', 'monetary policy', 'canadian dollar', 'monetary stimulus']","['canada inflation control', 'canadian dollar bank', 'context canada inflation', 'canadian economy grown', 'canadians informed bank']"
455,r061019a_BOC,canada,2006-10-19,Opening Statement before the House of Commons Standing Committee on Finance,dodge,1,"Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee. We appreciate the opportunity to meet with this committee, usually twice a year following the release of our . We were not able to meet last spring, so it has been a year since Paul and I were last before this committee. We believe that these meetings help us keep Members of Parliament and, through you, all Canadians, informed about the Bank's views on the economy and about the objective of monetary policy and the actions we take to achieve it. When Paul and I appeared before the Finance Committee last October, we noted at that time, that the global and Canadian economies were continuing to grow at a solid pace and that our economy appeared to be operating at full production capacity. In our latest , which we released this morning, we judge that the Canadian economy is currently operating just above capacity. While global economic growth is expected to be a little higher than previously anticipated, a weaker near-term outlook for the U.S. economy has curbed the near-term prospects for Canadian exports and growth. The Bank's outlook for growth in the Canadian economy has been revised down slightly from that outlined in July's . The Bank's base-case projection now calls for average annual GDP growth of 2.8 per cent in 2006, 2.5 per cent in 2007, and a return to 2.8 per cent in 2008. Weakness in labour productivity growth has led the Bank to lower its assumption for potential growth to 2.8 per cent for the 2006-08 period. Together, these factors imply that the small amount of excess demand now in the economy will be eliminated by mid-2007. Core inflation is expected to move a bit above 2 per cent in the coming months but return to the 2 per cent target by the middle of 2007 and remain there through to the end of 2008. Lower energy prices have led to a downward revision of the near-term projection for total CPI inflation. Total inflation (which includes the temporary impact of the GST reduction) will likely average about 1 1/2 per cent through the second quarter of 2007, before returning to the 2 per cent target and remaining there through to the end of 2008. As we noted at the time of our 6 September interest rate announcement, the risks around the base-case projection are judged to be a little greater than at the time of the July . The main upside risk relates to the momentum in household spending and housing prices, while the main downside risk is that the U.S. economy could slow more sharply than expected, leading to lower Canadian exports. The Bank judges that the risks to its inflation projection are roughly balanced. On 17 October, we left our key policy rate unchanged at 4.25 per cent. The current level is judged, at this time, to be consistent with achieving the inflation target over the medium term. We at the Bank will continue to pay close attention to the evolution of risks, as well as to economic and financial developments in the Canadian and global economies.","['gdp', 'economy', 'economic', 'finance', 'bank']","['canadian economy', 'canadian economies', 'economy revised', 'growth canadian', 'developments canadian']","['canadian economy revised', 'canadian economy currently', 'growth canadian economy', 'financial developments canadian', 'canadian economies continuing']"
512,r081127a_BOC,canada,2008-11-27,Fostering Financial System Stability,duguay,0,"Good evening. It's a great pleasure to be here. When I last spoke in Nova Scotia three years ago - almost to the day - I discussed the Bank of Canada's role in strengthening the country's financial system to make it resilient to shocks so as to limit damage from inevitable economic and financial storms. It was a timely metaphor, given that I spoke shortly after Hurricane Katrina had breached the levees of New Orleans. We were concerned at that time about the buildup of global economic imbalances, and about the narrowing of risk spreads which suggested that risk was perhaps being underestimated and vulnerable to a sudden reversal. These factors have since proven to be key contributors to the current, worldwide turmoil in financial markets. A third contributing factor, which we didn't foresee, has been the extent to which financial markets had expanded without proper support structures, like a house built on sand. I'll have more to say on this point a bit later in my remarks. So, I thought it would be worthwhile to review the risks we were aware of leading up to the current crisis, what took us by surprise, and what we have learned must be done to strengthen financial system resiliency for the future, both here and abroad. The Canadian financial system has fared relatively well through this crisis, thanks to effective regulation and prudent practices that have worked like sandbags to protect our financial system from the storms in today's global economy. In this respect, we may be a model for much of the world. But, because our prudential regulation is focused on protecting institutions, rather than supporting core financial markets, we have learned that there is still much work to do in this area. So I will also discuss some reforms that may be necessary to mitigate the effects of future global financial crises. I will close with a few words on the current economic situation in Canada. The global financial crisis We have all heard a great deal about the tumultuous global events that began in the summer of 2007 as a result of rapidly rising delinquencies on subprime mortgages in the United States. The sudden realization that exposure to these defaults was both widespread and difficult to locate (because of a lack of transparency) led to a drying up of liquidity and an increase in bank funding costs. That turmoil accelerated dramatically this September, moving far beyond liquidity problems to a more acute and broad-based crisis of confidence, sparked by a series of failures and near-failures of financial institutions in the United States and Europe, and increased prospects of a world recession. As a result,  wholesale funding markets came to a standstill in many countries, and commercial banks essentially stopped making unsecured loans to one another at terms longer than overnight. The crisis rippled through various markets as investors became very risk averse. Corporate bond spreads surged to new all-time highs, equity prices plunged, and foreign exchange rates became very volatile. Investors' concerns about the impact of the turmoil on the global economy turned into a vicious circle. Financial institutions became increasingly reluctant to extend credit, given their own funding difficulties and their concerns about what an economic slowdown would imply for the credit quality of their loan portfolios. Tighter credit conditions and the increased difficulties that businesses faced in trying to raise funds have, in turn, contributed to the slowdown in the world economy. Another contributing factor was the drop in consumer confidence triggered by the wealth destruction that resulted from sharp falls in equity markets and housing prices. The combination of these factors has produced extremely volatile and difficult financial conditions, and what has become the deepest, broadest, and longest financial crisis since the 1930s. In response, governments and central banks around the world - including the Bank of Canada - have undertaken a series of unprecedented actions aimed at stabilizing the financial system. These include making available significant overnight and term liquidity to a broad range of market participants; guarantees of bank deposits and borrowing; purchases of bad assets; and capital injections for financial institutions. The G-7 Plan of Action announced in early October has provided the foundation for urgent and unprecedented measures to stabilize financial markets and restore the flow of credit, essential to continued economic expansion. Importantly, it included a commitment from G-7 leaders to use all available tools to support systemically important financial institutions and prevent their failure. Governments in industrialized countries and in some systemically important emerging-market economies have also pledged to take steps to encourage economic growth and to reduce the severity of the global recession. Canada's response Consistent with the G-7 Plan of Action, the Bank of Canada has acted swiftly to ensure that adequate liquidity is available to institutions within our borders. Our actions have been significant. We have moved aggressively by expanding the Bank of Canada's provision of term purchase and resale agreements (PRAs) to a total of $34 billion . PRAs provide liquidity to key market participants for terms up to three months against a wide range of securities. Further, we have widened the range of assets we accept, and extended the range of counterparties with whom we will transact. We also introduced a new term-loan facility for those financial institutions that participate directly in the Large Value Transfer System, taking their non-mortgage loan portfolios as collateral.  I should point out that none of these liquidity measures are inflationary because they involve sales of government debt either from the Bank's portfolio or from new issuance rather than an increase in the money supply. The substitution of risk-free government securities for less liquid assets on the balance sheets of core financial institutions acts as a kind of lubricant to the machinery of banking. In return, these core institutions are expected to pass on the extra liquidity through other market participants and, ultimately, into the real economy. The federal government has also been actively working to address the impact of the financial crisis. In recent weeks, it announced the Canadian Lenders Assurance Facility, a voluntary program of insurance for interbank lending to ensure that Canadian institutions are not put at a competitive disadvantage to their international peers when raising funds in wholesale markets. The government has also increased to $75 billion the amount of insured mortgage pools that it will buy from financial institutions, thus supporting the availability of credit to Canadian households and businesses. How does the Bank of Canada deal with risks? The Bank of Canada's role in fostering financial system stability is not always well understood. So let me explain our work in this area a bit more. As part of its commitment to Canadians, the Bank fosters the safety and efficiency of the financial system, both in Canada and around the world. Our goal is to encourage a resilient system that can withstand shocks - even large shocks. The Bank's power to achieve this goal comes from our central position as Canada's monetary authority. This makes us the ultimate provider of liquidity to Canadian financial institutions and to the country's financial system more generally. It also gives us a prominent voice in international organizations as well as in such domestic bodies as the Financial Institutions SAC provide forums for the Federal Deputy Minister of Finance, the Superintendent of advise the federal government on financial sector policy. At the international level, the Bank, the federal Department of Finance, and the (FSF). The impetus for this global forum came from a summit of G-7 leaders in Halifax more than a dozen years ago, and the FSF truly came to life in the wake of the Asian crisis of the late 1990s. This entity brings together senior representatives of national financial authorities from selected countries to promote international financial stability, reduce the spread of shocks, and increase market resiliency. The importance of the FSF as a source of global coordination was recently underscored by the G-20 leaders, with their call for its expansion to include top emerging-market economies such as China and  As you can tell from that description, the Bank has essentially two key tools at its disposal. One is our power to supply liquidity; the other is our capacity to produce the solid research and analysis that underpins our advice and enables us to influence public sector decisions and private sector behaviour. We do not supervise financial institutions for depositor protection - that falls within the realm of OSFI and CDIC. Nor do we regulate financial markets for investor protection - a responsibility carried out by the provincial securities commissions. To carry out our responsibilities, we monitor trends in financial developments in Canada and abroad, assess their implications for financial system stability, and identify risks to the Canadian financial system so that we can act and convince others to act, to limit damage from economic and financial storms. We publish our assessments, based on this monitoring, in our semi-annual . The next issue will be published and posted on the Bank's website on 11 December. Strengthening resiliency At the beginning of my remarks, I spoke briefly about the need to strengthen the resilience of our financial system. As I have already noted, in Canada we have taken many of the correct steps, some beginning 20 years ago, as we worked to strengthen the supervisory system for individual financial institutions. The coordination among domestic agencies with an interest in the financial services sector is based on a long history of effective collaboration and on a common understanding of where mandates interact. Yet there is still work to do so that we can be even better prepared the next time a crisis crashes onto our shores. History shows this is inevitable, given the difficulty investors have in going against the crowd and resisting the extremes of heady optimism in good times, and fear and even panic in bad times. Given that inevitability, it is imperative that we address the weaknesses in the global financial system and in the regulatory and supervisory architecture that were exposed by the current crisis, if we are to increase the resiliency of the financial system to shocks and better support economic stability. The Financial Stability Forum has examined lessons from the current crisis and made a number of recommendations earlier this year aimed at enhancing market and institutional resiliency. Work continues under the guiding principles of the FSF, to encourage a financial system that: operates with less leverage; is immune to the misaligned incentives that contributed to the current crisis; and has stronger oversight and greater transparency so that risks can be more readily identified and dealt with. Collectively, we must find ways to improve the transparency of complex products traded in financial markets, so that investors are better able to assess the risks they take on. We  must also examine how best to strengthen macroprudential regulation (as opposed to institution-centered microprudential regulation) by: bolstering controls on leverage; encouraging the buildup of adequate capital buffers in good times that can be drawn upon in bad times, thus dampening the credit cycle; developing mechanisms to provide liquidity to core financial markets so that they remain open; and expanding the amount of financial infrastructure that is properly risk-proofed, for example, custodial banks and clearing houses for credit default swaps (CDS.) Economic outlook Let me close with a few words about the economic outlook. The intensification of the global financial crisis has led in Canada to an increase in credit spreads and a tightening in credit conditions generally. The global recession is deepening, and with it there have been further declines in the prices of many commodities and a deterioration in Canada's terms of trade, which reduces Canadian incomes. The nature of the slowdown in the United States, with the acute weakness in the housing and auto sectors, is particularly problematic for our exporters. These factors present serious challenges to Canadian industries, including key Nova Scotia industries in the primary resources, manufacturing, and tourism sectors. Thus, while domestic demand in Canada remains relatively healthy and the depreciation of the Canadian dollar will offset some of the declines in external demand, the risks to growth and inflation in Canada identified in the October appear to have shifted to the downside. In the face of the crisis, we have already cut official interest rates by half, to 2 1/4 per cent over the past year and have stated that some further monetary stimulus will likely be required to achieve the inflation target over the medium term. Let me conclude. We have avoided the worst effects of the global financial crisis, thanks to a resilient financial sector built on the conservative lending practices of Canadian banks, and to our effective regulation and prudent practices in the sector. Still, the crisis is being felt in our economy. But we have taken bold steps to re-open financial markets and I can assure you that the Bank of Canada will continue to provide as much liquidity as is needed to encourage the re-establishment of the normal functioning of Canadian financial markets. You can also count on the Bank to add its voice to calls for initiatives to strengthen the resiliency of both the domestic and international financial systems.","['crises', 'risk', 'hurricane', 'risks', 'recession']","['financial storms', 'financial crises', 'risks canadian', 'resilient shocks', 'financial shocks']","['risks canadian financial', 'financial storms today', 'economic financial storms', 'crisis led canada', 'protect financial storms']"
781,r180516a_BOC,canada,2018-05-16,The (Mostly) Long and Short of  Potential Output,schembri,0,"Thank you for inviting me here today. An important, if sometimes underappreciated, purpose of central bank speeches is to help the public understand what we are trying to achieve, and why. A greater understanding of our monetary policy actions helps make them more effective. And as a public institution, we have an obligation to highlight and demystify the concepts that guide our thinking in a way that all interested citizens, not just the experts in this room, can grasp. Few in the public likely give much thought to potential output, for example. Yet this somewhat abstract notion is vital to how most central banks evaluate inflationary pressures and conduct monetary policy. At the Bank of Canada, being able to estimate and project potential output has contributed notably to our strong track record of meeting our inflation objectives. At the same time, the dynamics of potential output are primarily shaped by slow-moving forces that can take time to have a material impact, such as demographic shifts, capital accumulation and technological change. Equally important, many of these same forces influence a country's standard of living. A significant development in recent decades is that growth in potential output has been on a generally downward trend in most major advanced economies, including Canada, largely owing to the aging of our populations. This trend has important implications for our macroeconomic policy frameworks and for our economic prospects. My remarks today are organized around four separate but closely related questions: How do we measure it? Why is it important for policy? What policies have supported potential output growth in the past and could again in the future? The answers to these questions should help you better understand not only our policy in the near term, but also our thinking about policy-making over a longer horizon. Turning to the first question, we usually refer to ""potential"" in the context of individual achievement, as in ""realizing one's potential."" When I was much younger, for example, my aspirations for my own potential included growing as tall as my favourite player on the Dallas Cowboys, becoming a pitcher for the Toronto Blue Jays, and obtaining a PhD. My immigrant parents placed more value on education than sports, so they were quite relieved that I only managed two out of three. Central banks apply ""potential"" in a similar way--to assess what an entire economy, rather than a single person, can achieve on a sustainable basis. So ""potential"" can be viewed as a measure of aggregate, or total, supply in an economy. Essentially, it refers to an economy's capacity to produce goods and services when all available productive resources--specifically, labour and capital--are used to their fullest. In practice, we pay close attention to the growth rate of potential output as well as to its level . An economy's productive capacity is normally always growing as available resources and their productivity expand. But the speed at which potential output grows has important short- and long-run implications. In the short run, the rate of potential output growth indicates how quickly an economy can grow on an ongoing basis without stoking inflationary pressures. In the long run, potential output growth is a useful gauge of an economy's prospects, namely the outlook for national income and standard of living, because these are largely determined by the forces of supply. Digging a little deeper, most central banks including the Bank of Canada-, interpret an economy's actual output growth, its gross domestic product (GDP), as being determined in the short run by the forces moving aggregate demand. An economy's potential output growth, meanwhile, reflects the evolution of aggregate supply over a longer horizon Aggregate demand growth tends to move with short-term factors--such as shocks to foreign demand and exports--which may trigger cyclical movements in, for example, inventories and consumer purchases of durable goods. Aggregate supply growth is affected more by the slow-moving forces that I noted earlier. So, a central challenge in pinning down potential output growth is disentangling the short-term fluctuations in GDP caused by demand shocks from long-term fluctuations that are due to the underlying forces that affect aggregate supply. Since the forces that determine aggregate supply tend to change slowly, we focus on trends when thinking about and measuring potential. Now, it's rarely as simple as just separating short-term phenomena from long-term. The Great Recession was a once-in-a-lifetime shock to aggregate demand that, because of its severity, also affected aggregate supply. Consequently, a decade later, this experience continues to have an impact on potential output in advanced economies. So, the disentanglement challenge is two-fold: first, identifying the trend movements, as opposed to temporary or cyclical ones; then, identifying the forces driving the trend movements, which also helps us predict how long they'll persist. I'll go into more detail shortly about how we measure potential output growth. But one way to look at it is to break it into two components: the long-run growth rate of total hours worked in the economy--known as trend the long-run growth rate of how much output is produced per hour of work-- known as trend labour productivity (TLP). shows each component's respective contributions to Canadian potential output growth since 1992. The chart reflects the findings of the Bank's annual reassessment of potential output growth, which we recently published as an appendix to our April Two observations are important. First, the chart shows a secular, or persistent, decline in TLI and, thus, in potential output growth. Population aging is the biggest reason, and it is only partly offset by immigration. Second, TLP's contribution to potential output growth has also declined somewhat from the period before the global financial crisis. TLP growth is expected to increase modestly in the coming years. This is mainly because the slowdown in investment and productivity growth that followed the sharp decline in commodity prices in 2014-15 turned out to be less pronounced than we initially expected, and the economy's adjustment from it is now mostly behind us. That is good news because TLP growth is expected to play a larger role in potential output growth over the projection and beyond. There is, however, considerable debate about how much we can expect productivity growth to rise in the future, even as the emerging digital economy promises to transform how firms operate and how they use their workforces. Canada's experience is similar to that of other advanced economies. shows that potential output growth in Japan, the United States and key countries in the euro area is also much lower now than it was in the 1980s, largely due to the same forces causing the slowdown in Canada. For Canada specifically, the Bank's reassessment found that annual potential output growth from 2009 to 2021 would average 1.8 per cent, much lower than the 2.7 per cent average from 1982 to 2008. With all of this in mind, let's tackle the hard question of how to measure potential output. The main challenge in measuring potential output is that it is hypothetical, so it is not directly observable. We can only estimate it. Over the years, though, the Bank has put a lot of research effort into refining our methods for assessing this very important variable. Techniques for estimating potential output growth can be viewed as being along a spectrum ( ). At one end are simple statistical models that aim to capture underlying trends in output growth by mechanically filtering out short-term fluctuations. The problem with these techniques is they are essentially a ""black box""--the data going in and the estimates coming out are known, but there's little economic explanation of how they are connected. At the other end of the spectrum are structural models that rely primarily on relationships between variables, based on economic theory, to identify and quantify the impacts of different sources of potential output growth. For example, higher levels of investment will cause the capital stock to rise faster, leading to more rapid TLP and potential output growth. However, structural models may produce inaccurate estimates if the economic theory on which they are based is incorrect or incomplete. To help manage the uncertainty around measuring potential output growth, the Bank uses a variety of models along this spectrum that combine statistical filters and theorybased structural approaches. This is done so that we can cross-check the estimates from each model and then combine them to get a reasonably robust assessment. , for example, displays estimates for potential output growth from four separate models along the spectrum that are part of the Bank's staff tool box. Models that incorporate an economic structure are especially useful for projecting TLP growth, since TLP is based on variables and relationships that are difficult to measure and predict. TLI growth is comparatively easier to forecast because it is based on accurately observed labour market outcomes: the employment rate, the working-age population and average hours worked. In contrast, TLP growth depends on two variables that are less concrete and therefore more challenging to observe precisely. The first of these, capital deepening , is a measure of growth in the ratio of capital per hour worked. The second is a more elusive concept called trend total factor productivity , or TFP. While we have some observable measures of investment and capital stock growth, we do not have the same for trend TFP--which essentially includes everything affecting firms' productivity that isn't captured by capital stock growth. These ""residual"" factors include, for example, technological improvements and the impact of education and training. Another way that the Bank manages the uncertainty around potential output growth is by conducting an in-depth review of our projections on an annual basis. First, economic data are regularly revised, so for that reason alone an annual review makes sense. Also, our empirical techniques are ""living"" in a sense--we are continually improving them as we learn from experience and ongoing research. Plus, in the annual reassessment, we further account for uncertainty by publishing ranges around our estimates and projections that expand with time . We also list the factors that could lead potential growth to be lower or higher within those ranges. I would like to stress that the Bank recognizes the difficulties associated with measuring potential and the related uncertainty, and so takes a deliberate and rigorous approach to managing this uncertainty. We work hard to ensure that our models evolve in line with prevailing best practices. And on top of using multiple techniques, we corroborate the models' results against other measures of capacity and inflation, and then apply wellinformed judgment. Finally, the uncertainty around these estimates is taken into account in the formulation of monetary policy. This helps us ensure that our estimates and our policy decisions are consistent with our broader economic outlook. Now, let me expand on why potential output is important for policy. The conduct of monetary policy For the conduct of monetary policy, the difference between the level of actual and potential output--the ""output gap""--is a critical element. It indicates how much slack there is in the economy, and so it is an important determinant and useful gauge of underlying inflationary pressures. As an inflation-targeting central bank , the Bank of Canada's assessments of both the current output gap and its projected evolution have direct bearing on our inflation outlook and policy decisions. Because monetary policy operates with a well-known lag, the Bank must be forward-looking as we set the policy interest rate to affect aggregate demand, close any output gap and return inflation to target on a sustainable basis. A higher level of potential output for a given level of GDP will mean a more ""negative"" output gap--implying (other things being equal) inflation below the 2 per cent target, greater economic slack and a possible need to ease the policy rate--and vice versa. Along with the output gap, expectations of inflation are also important in explaining current inflation. As inflation targets have become more credible, expectations have become better anchored at the target rate and, in turn, have had a larger influence on inflation itself. To illustrate the relationship between the output gap and inflation, consider . It shows that the Bank's three measures of core inflation all increased steadily over the past year following, with a short lag, the narrowing of our measure of the output gap. This demonstrates how we use other data to corroborate our estimates of the output gap, which helps ensure a coherent economic outlook. The higher the projected growth rate of potential output, the faster the economy can grow without inflation rising persistently above our target. For example, our 2018 reassessment revised the profile for potential higher than it was in the 2017 reassessment, both in terms of its level and growth rate. That means that, in the near term, we have a bit more room than we thought to support demand without sparking undue inflationary pressures. Challenges to the monetary policy framework Although the inflation-targeting framework has been very successful in the past, looking ahead, the decline in potential output growth in many advanced economies represents a notable challenge and has prompted central banks in those countries to revisit their monetary policy frameworks. Let me explain. Lower potential output growth in advanced economies is one of the factors likely contributing to a decline in global real interest rates. For monetary policy, this implies that the policy rate that is considered neutral--where it will neither stimulate nor cool the economy because GDP is growing at its potential level, inflation is at target, and the effects of any shocks have faded--is lower than it would be otherwise. lower neutral rate has important implications for monetary policy. To effectively buffer the economy in response to a harmful shock, it's desirable that a central bank has sufficient room to lower the policy interest rate without going to zero or below, thus being forced to use unconventional tools such as large-scale asset purchases (i.e., quantitative or credit easing) or negative interest rates. Our next inflation-target renewal with the Government of Canada, which represents an opportunity to review our monetary policy framework, is slated for 2021. As part of that process, we will examine ways to meet this challenge and strengthen the framework to enhance the resilience of the Canadian economy. Lower potential output growth also has implications for fiscal policy because it implies less tax revenue than otherwise. Less revenue could limit governments' abilities to implement countercyclical fiscal policy when needed, particularly as demands for public expenditures rise with an aging population. This aspect is important for monetary policy, too. The credibility and success of our inflation-targeting regime depends critically on the coherence of the overall macroeconomic policy framework. To maintain solid potential output growth and rising living standards in the future, what policy lessons can be drawn from the past? Historically, Canada has benefited from strong growth and rising living standards. Great economic opportunity has stimulated employment and investment in capital, while also encouraging investment in individuals through accessible, quality education and an inclusive social safety net. We also have benefited from robust political, legal and economic institutions, and from openness to trade, investment and immigration. Despite those advantages, developing the appropriate policies to maintain solid potential output growth in the face of an aging population is a formidable challenge. Moreover, even the most effective policies can take some time to have a meaningful impact. That said, I'd like to touch on three policy areas that have been successful at promoting potential output growth in the past: education --I have benefited from the opportunity created by my own access, and my parents' commitment, to good-quality education at all levels; immigration --which is something I know a bit about since my parents arrived in Canada from Europe during the 1950s; and trade liberalization --which I have studied and analyzed for my entire professional life. As Alfred Marshall--a founder of neoclassical economics--emphasized more than a century ago, education is critical to economic progress. In a period of accelerating technological change, boosting skills and the flexibility of the labour supply may be as important for potential output growth as the size of the workforce. Improvements to education and training will help make workers more productive, which should in turn boost their employers' overall productivity and lift the economy's potential. In Marshall's era, the main impediment to the quality of the labour force was illiteracy. This was a huge obstacle to lifelong learning and self-improvement. The vast majority of Canadians, of course, can read and have basic numeracy skills. But this wasn't always the case. Our economy's transition around the turn of the 20th century from agriculture to industry was facilitated by promoting public and private investment in education that provided broader access. The question today is whether education and training can equip a growing share of the workforce with the right skills for an increasingly technology-driven economy. While the challenge today may seem more daunting, it also appeared insurmountable in Marshall's time. Yet, the expected private and social returns were great, so investment followed. History needs to be repeated. New technologies should be harnessed to provide broad access to the types of education and training that will help Canadians prosper amid rapid change. This would also help to address rising income inequality, much of which is due to technological change that favours those with greater skills. Higher immigration levels offer an obvious avenue for boosting potential by increasing the supply of labour, given that immigration already accounts for two-thirds of the growth in Canada's workforce. Canada's immigration policy has long been considered a success because of its record of attracting immigrants with the necessary skills to be absorbed into the labour force and to make important economic contributions. This approach will be particularly crucial going forward as the workforce gets older. An important challenge, though, is whether Canada's immigration policy can raise the levels accepted each year while continuing to be as successful as in the past at matching immigrants' skills to the jobs that are available. recently, more could be done to speed up immigrants' integration into the workforce, particularly given the elevated number of job vacancies in Canada. Trade liberalization Given demographic constraints, the most promising remedies for lifting potential may be measures that stand to increase productivity. This speaks not only to the importance of education, as I mentioned, but also to that of creating a climate that encourages capital investment. This can be done through, for example, infrastructure spending and other efforts to ease transportation constraints. Perhaps most helpful in this regard, though, is trade liberalization. Our experience with past and existing trade arrangements demonstrates the benefits of lowering barriers, both external and internal, including improvements in productivity that supported growth in the overall earnings of workers--a direct boost to living standards. Council colleague Tim Lane noted in remarks last September, expanding Canadian firms' access to overseas markets spurs them to invest, innovate and increase their productivity. As in other advanced economies, there is renewed focus in Canada on ensuring that we help the workers who are displaced by trade agreements. Again, education and training can help people adjust. Still, there is no question that Canada has benefited from being one of the world's most diversified, trade-driven economies. Even as uncertainty about US trade policy currently weighs on business investment and export growth, Canada's recent agreements with the European Union and with countries in the Pacific region, in addition to efforts at the interprovincial level, are helping reduce barriers and create opportunities for Canadian companies. Our history tells us that our firm commitment to trade liberalization will remain important for supporting solid potential growth in the future. Allow me to conclude with three key messages. First, potential output is an indispensable input into the formulation of monetary policy, because the output gap is important in determining inflationary pressures in the economy. Using the output gap as our guide has helped underpin the success of the Bank of Canada's inflation-targeting regime, which has, on average, delivered inflation roughly at the 2 per cent target on a consistent basis for more than a quarter-century. Second, the Bank's multifaceted approach to measuring and using potential output-- drawing on diverse tools and on different sources of information--helps to manage uncertainty and ensure reasonably robust estimates. This deliberate and regularly updated approach has also contributed to our success. Third, like other advanced economies, Canada faces important challenges to our policy frameworks and to our economic prospects from lower rates of potential output growth. Nonetheless, we have a rich history of generating economic opportunity and supporting growth, and we should draw from past successes in developing future policies. In closing, I mentioned earlier that although potential is mostly a function of longer-term, slow-moving forces, the Great Recession had a severe and protracted impact on potential output. With the economy now operating close to potential, solid demand growth is spawning business investment, firm entry and improved labour-market conditions--all of which are helping to repair that damage. As noted in recent policy statements, we are closely monitoring this expansion in economic capacity. It will help guide us in achieving our goal of low, stable and predictable inflation, which is the best contribution monetary policy can make to support sustainable growth and rising living standards in Canada.","['inflationary', 'inflation', 'macroeconomic', 'monetary', 'fiscal']","['canada inflation', 'stoking inflationary', 'influence inflation', 'evaluate inflationary', 'underlying inflationary']","['bank canada inflation', 'canada inflation targeting', 'banks evaluate inflationary', 'implications monetary policy', 'important determining inflationary']"
873,r211027a_BOC,canada,2021-10-27,Monetary Policy Report Press Conference Opening Statement,macklem,1,"Governor of the Bank of Canada Press conference following the release of the Good morning. I'm pleased to be here with you--in person--to discuss today's policy announcement and the Bank's It seems fitting that we are back together in this somewhat normal setting as we conclude one part of our extraordinary monetary policy response to this pandemic. This morning we announced that we are ending quantitative easing (QE) after more than year and a half. We undertook QE first to help restore market functioning and then to boost our monetary policy stimulus. Since last October, in line with progress in Canada's economic recovery, we have been gradually reducing the pace of our QE purchases. With the economy once again growing robustly, Governing Council judged that QE is no longer needed. This means we will stop growing our holdings of Government of Canada bonds. It is important, however, to remind Canadians that the significant stimulus we have injected through QE remains in place. We just won't be adding to it. We call this the reinvestment phase. In this phase, we will purchase bonds only to replace those that are maturing so that our overall holdings of Government of Canada bonds remain roughly stable over time. The end of QE comes as increasing vaccination rates are enabling continued progress in the economic recovery in Canada and around the world. While new complications of reopening continue to crop up and that is boosting the prices of many globally traded goods, I'm struck by how much progress our economy has made since the start of the crisis. We've come a long way. And our forecast is for an increasingly healthy economy, even if these complications are going to be with us for a while longer. We are forecasting annual growth in economic activity will be around 5 percent this disruptions and shipping bottlenecks are expected to restrain growth and boost prices into next year. So relative to our forecast in July, growth in Canada is a little lower and inflation takes longer to come back down. The main forces pushing up prices--higher energy prices and supply bottlenecks--now appear stronger and more persistent than we previously thought. Let me expand on these themes and say a few words about the key points of the Of course, we discussed the evolution of COVID-19. While vaccination rates are generally very high in Canada and the number of cases in most regions has declined, the pandemic continues to disrupt our lives. Some of the disruptions were expected--we've never closed and reopened the economy before, so it was bound  to be bumpy. But others, including labour-market frictions and supply disruptions, are more pronounced than anticipated. Let me talk about each of these in turn. We've seen strong job growth in recent months. Many sectors that were hardest hit by lockdowns earlier in the pandemic rebounded strongly as Canadians resumed more normal activities. Strong job growth has reduced the very uneven impacts of the pandemic, particularly for youth and women. However, the recovery of lowwage jobs continues to lag, many people are not working as many hours as they would like, and the large number of people who have been unemployed for more than six months remains a concern. Slack remains in the labour market. But even as the unemployment rate remains well above pre-pandemic levels, job vacancies have risen sharply. This is unusual. Our recent indicates that labour shortages have intensified in two areas. The first is shortages of skilled trades and digital workers. This is a challenge that existed before the pandemic as well. The second is more pandemic-specific. As service businesses like restaurants and stores reopened this summer, many had trouble hiring workers quickly enough to meet the surge in demand. Part of this reflects the reality that it simply takes time for companies to find workers with the right skills, and for workers to find the right jobs. Repeated closures in some sectors and the challenges of working in high-contact jobs during a pandemic may also be affecting the workforce. About half of the unemployed workers who responded to the recent Canadian Survey of Consumer Expectations said they're considering a move to a different industry. With lots of Canadians still looking for work, and many employers hiring, we expect employment growth to continue in the months ahead. But the process of matching workers and jobs is more difficult than in a typical recovery, and it could take some time to work through these issues. Governing Council also spent time discussing supply chain disruptions. The global shortage of semiconductors and other manufacturing inputs, as well as shipping and other transportation bottlenecks, are affecting production and delaying deliveries of many goods. While we highlighted some of these problems in our July MPR, they are more widespread and look to be more persistent than we anticipated. Quantifying the impact of these supply factors is difficult, but the implication is that there is likely less excess supply in the economy than we thought there would be. We now expect the output gap to close sometime in the middle quarters of 2022, which is earlier than we projected in July. Let me underline there is more uncertainty than normal around the economy's productive capacity due to the unusual circumstances of the pandemic. The combination of on-going supply disruptions and related cost pressures, as well as higher energy prices, is putting upward pressure on many prices around the world. In Canada, inflation is currently running at about 4 1/2 percent. We now expect it will rise to close to 5 percent by the end of this year, before coming back down to around the 2 percent target by the end of next year. In other words, we continue to expect that inflation will ease back, but relative to our July forecast, it is higher for longer.  We know higher prices are challenging for Canadians, making it harder for them to cover their bills. I want to assure you that inflation is not going to stay as high as it is today, even if it is going to take somewhat longer to come down. The Bank of Canada is committed to ensuring that price increases don't become ongoing inflation. So far, measures of medium- to longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored on the 2 percent target, and overall wage pressures remain moderate. This suggests that higher prices are not becoming embedded in expectations of ongoing inflation. As these forces play out, it is our job to bring inflation back to target, and I can assure you we will do that. In view of the continued excess capacity in the economy, my fellow Governing Council members and I judged that the economy still needs considerable monetary policy support. While we ended QE, we kept our policy interest rate at its lowest level, and reaffirmed our commitment to keep it there until slack in the economy is absorbed so that the 2 percent inflation target is sustainably achieved. Based on our current projection, this happens sometime in the middle quarters of 2022. Let me conclude with some additional information on the end of QE and the shift to reinvestment. Following the announcement of our decision this morning, we issued a market notice outlining in detail the changes to our market operations. Because bond maturities are lumpy, we are moving to a monthly rather than a weekly target range for our purchases. That target range will be $4 billion to $5 billion per month. This includes our purchases in both the primary and secondary markets. As outlined in the market notice, to keep our holdings of Government of Canada bonds roughly stable, we plan to purchase roughly $1 billion to $2 billion per month in the primary market, and roughly $2 1/2 billion to 3 1/2 billion per month in the secondary market. How long the reinvestment phase lasts is a future monetary policy decision. It will depend on the strength of the recovery and the evolution of inflation. But as I indicated in September, it is reasonable to expect that we will be there for a period of time, at least until we raise our policy interest rate. We will continue to provide the appropriate degree of monetary policy stimulus to support the recovery and achieve the inflation target. With that, let me stop and turn to you for questions.","['qe', 'easing', 'reinvestment', 'bond', 'bonds']","['quantitative easing', 'easing qe', 'canada bonds', 'qe remains', 'end qe']","['quantitative easing qe', 'ending quantitative easing', 'easing qe year', 'government canada bonds', 'canada bonds remain']"
908,r970630b_ECB,euro area,1997-06-30,Farewell to a Central banker,duisenberg,1,"Three and a half years ago, when you exchanged the premises of the Bank for International Settlements, an established international financial institution, for a couple of floors in a Frankfurter ""Hochhaus"", you took on a huge task. Your first mission was to set up the European Monetary Institute (EMI), more or less starting from scratch. Moreover, you were faced with the responsibility of managing the preparations for Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). It was not an easy decision to embark on a grand project like EMU, but putting the flesh on the bones of monetary union is even more difficult. To be honest, at that time I would not like to have been in your shoes. 2. On both accounts you did a great job. The EMI is currently a thriving organisation. The Institute started off with a handful of staff, more or less taken over from the Secretariat of the Committee of EC Central Bank Governors. At present the EMI employs more than 200 people. Before the EMI was established, you had to take seemingly trivial decisions, like choosing suitable furniture for the meeting room of the EMI Council. At an exhibition of furniture on the 36th floor, you immediately picked the smallest chair available, I was told. Indeed, your modesty graces you, but looking at my size, and I'm sure I also speak on behalf of some other colleagues, I'm glad you eventually picked a larger one. 3. With respect to the preparations for EMU, both the EMI as well as the central banks are on track. Indeed, as far as we are all concerned, EMU can start on 1 January 1999. Hence, you also made things easier for me. You have played the ball from the tee to the green, thus leaving me the ""easy"" task of putting it in. 4. Alexandre, I don't think we are able to play a birdie or an eagle, let alone a hole-in-one. But I promise you, we will play on par. And I can tell you, I've done worse. Things have not always been easy for you when chairing the meetings of the EMI Council. But being a central banker, heart and soul, you have always managed to find compromises. I vividly remember a few meetings of the EMI Council which you eventually managed to conclude successfully, although they started off as a babel of tongues. Also when ever the atmosphere around the table started to become a bit tense, you always emphasised the need for co-operation and co-ordination. Indeed, in your opening statement to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy on the European Monetary Institute in November 1993, shortly before you officially took office as the first President of the EMI, you stressed the importance of enhanced monetary policy co-ordination among Member States as a means of steering as smoothly as possible towards Stage Three of EMU. You also stated that the EMI can and should play a constructive role in promoting this process of policy co-ordination. 5. With the benefit of hindsight, everybody will agree that the EMI, under your management, has indeed contributed to a co-operative spirit among the EU national central banks. Indeed, as commentators often focus on the convergence of fiscal policies, which still leaves something to be desired, it is sometimes forgotten that the monetary conditions for the start of a monetary union between the Member States have never been so favourable. In your foreword to the 1996 Annual Report of the EMI you rightly observe that EU foreign exchange markets are moderately calm and long-term interest rates are low, while differentials have narrowed appreciably. But Lamfalussy would not be Lamfalussy if he did not immediately add some reservations. The risks and challenges should not be underestimated, although you see grounds for cautious optimism. Indeed, you would not be a central banker without writing that counter-inflationary vigilance remains essential, although monetary policy has - in your eyes - justifiably been eased against the overall background of subdued inflationary pressures. 6. One of your greatest assets is that you have managed to combine this typical conservative and cautious nature of a central banker, always focused on substance, with your firm belief in European monetary integration. Having been a member of the Delors Committee for the Study of Economic and Monetary Union, you were at the cradle of European monetary union. You have never believed that a true single market is in the long run compatible with a quasi-floating exchange rate system. Over the past three and a half years, you have acted as a devoted missionary of EMU and European integration in general. In this capacity, you have managed to convert at least some incredulous European central bankers. And like any good missionary, you have also spread the message of EMU to the outside world. Over the last few years, you have held 67 official speeches and appeared in public on many other occasions, in total approximately 175 times. Indeed, you have beaten me there. A few days ago, when I took leave of the staff of De Nederlandsche Bank, I was reminded of having ""only"" held some 155 official speeches during my presidency of more than 15 years. 7. Dear Alexandre, good wine needs no bush, as we say in the Netherlands. But some wines have such a delicious and well-balanced taste that they cannot remain unnoticed. The ""Chateau Lamfalussy"", in 1929, is one of them. I am very grateful to you for leaving me a smoothly functioning and high quality institution, which the EMI currently is. And I wish you and your wife all the best.","['bank', 'banks', 'emu', 'emi', 'monetary']","['monetary union', 'european monetary', 'institution emi', 'monetary institute', 'union emu']","['monetary union emu', 'monetary institute emi', 'european monetary union', 'european monetary institute', 'start monetary union']"
920,r971127a_ECB,euro area,1997-11-27,Monetary policy in Europe - Quo Vadis?,london,0,"Ladies and Gentlemen, we are in a fortunate position in Europe. We have been able to prepare a new monetary regime for Europe at a time when a consensus about the role of monetary policy exists among central bankers and the large majority of politicians and academics. We are thus able to shape the new institutions accordingly. Let me first explain what I mean by the current consensus about the role of monetary policy among macroeconomists. Second, having established the state of the art (and it is certainly still true that central banking is more of an art than a science), I shall briefly describe my vision of how monetary policy could ideally be run in Europe, while illustrating my view that the structure of the ESCB and its operating procedures are in line with these standards, and may thus be able to transform that vision into reality. The views expressed in the following statements would nowadays be shared by a large majority of economists: Monetary policy cannot influence the growth rate of the economy by having an effect on aggregate demand in the long run. Economic growth depends on the productivity and the supply of factors of production such as labour and capital. No central bank in the world is able to increase its country's growth rate permanently by printing money or even by reducing the nominal interest rate to zero. The reason being that any excess demand over the production of goods and services will sooner or later be reflected in inflation. Persistent inflation is always a monetary phenomenon. Although monetary policy action can exert a temporary influence on the level of real economic activity - due particularly to sluggish adjustment of wages and prices. An ""activist"" monetary policy though aimed at boosting growth without due regard for price stability will merely cause inflation. Expectations of market participants such as trade unions and employers are of crucial importance for the effect of any policy measure, and the expected reaction pattern of the central bank affects current decisions by the private sector. Let me give you an example. If the central bank is known to react to excessive wage demands by raising interest rates, thereby stabilising prices and temporarily reducing output, instead of by lowering rates to dampen the burden on firms affected by the wage shock, excessive wage demands may not occur in the first place. Thus, if the goal of price stability is evident and credible, stable monetary policy will become much easier to implement. High inflation hampers economic growth. High and volatile inflation imposes substantial economic costs, such as those arising from increased uncertainty about the outcome of investment decisions and profitability, the distortionary effects on the tax system, rising risk premia in long-term interest rates and the reduced allocative effectiveness of the price and market system. In addition, social costs arise because the weaker members of society have more difficulty in protecting themselves against the adverse effects of inflation. There is agreement that inflation should be low, but no full consensus on what that exactly means in quantitative terms. Many of my European colleagues and myself would put the level at between 0 and 2%. Some others would envisage a somewhat wider range. On the basis of these views, the implications for a price stability oriented monetary policy in Europe are clear, and can be articulated as follows: (i) given the desirability of low inflation, and since persistent inflation is always a monetary phenomenon, it follows that a central bank's goal should be price stability; (ii) in pursuing the goal of price stability monetary policy may contribute to smoothing the level of economic activity in the short run, if inflationary pressures tend to follow a cyclical pattern. It should be noted that the success of such action depends crucially on the credibility of monetary policy; (iii) it goes without saying that monetary policy and fiscal policy should be well aligned as an adverse policy mix would imply placing an excessive burden on monetary policy; (iv) the importance of conditioning expectations and thus establishing the credibility of the central bank's anti-inflationary stance requires independent central banking. A monetary authority should be able to act free of political pressure, and according to transparent policy rules which should also be communicated to the public. A rule which aims at stabilising prices - either via a direct inflation target or a money supply target - will smoothen the business cycle and allow the economy to grow at its potential growth rate; Some of the past mistakes and deficiencies of monetary policy which have contributed over time to the emergence of the consensus I have just described have stemmed from a lack of independence. This has included attempts to use monetary policy for fiscal purposes (such as trying to reduce the real debt burden by surprise inflation) and the many unsuccessful attempts to boost growth through inflation, ignoring the effects on market expectations. A central bank which abandons its price stability target for a transitory gain in economic activity only contributes to higher average inflation. A central bank which has been susceptible to public pressure usually hits the brakes too late, too hard and, I might add, with unnecessarily heavy wear and tear on the ""tyres"" - aggravating the volatility of the business cycle rather than smoothing it out. I say this despite some proposals (Joseph Stiglitz, chief economist of the World Bank) claiming that ""we should not follow a policy of pre-emptive strikes, but rather one of cautious expansionism"" with which I disagree. This kind of strategy would mean in case of doubt letting the central bank err on the side of being too expansionary. The argument is that the costs of a minor increase in average inflation will be more than compensated by gains in employment. In my opinion, this argument again neglects the effect of market expectations. When people realise the systematic bias in the central banks monetary policy rule, there will be no output gain attached to the undoubtedly higher inflation rate. Nevertheless, there are costs involved. Even starting from low levels, higher inflation means higher volatility, which will then be reflected in higher risk premia and thus higher real interest rates - and eventually lower growth rates. If we cast an eye over the structure of the future European System of Central Banks (ESCB) the impression we get is that lessons have been learned and economic theory applied in the best possible manner. Maintaining price stability will be the ESCB's primary responsibility. Without prejudice to this primary objective of price stability, the ESCB will support the general economic policies in the European Union. The Maastricht Treaty assigns independence to the ESCB for the purpose of carrying out its mandate. With regard to monetary strategy, monetary and inflation targeting are seen as the two benchmarks on the basis of which the ESCB's strategy in Stage Three will be selected. The credibility of its monetary policy is further supported by the budgetary provisions of the Treaty, which oblige Member States to avoid excessive budget deficits. The Stability and Growth Pact clearly defines the exceptional circumstances under which excessive deficits are allowed and provides for a procedure which will ensure that excessive deficits are swiftly corrected, should they nevertheless arise, thus protecting the euro area against an unfavourable policy mix. The ESCB is prohibited from financing government debt. Thus the ESCB is relieved of any possible pressure to accommodate public debt by means of an expansionary monetary policy, which could otherwise have been interpreted as a constraint on its independence. I would like to conclude by stating that the essence of good monetary policy is good institutional design. Apparently, lessons have been learned and principles have been applied successfully. Europe has the opportunity to bring what has at times been a tumultuous chapter in its monetary history to a close. It should seize that opportunity and enjoy the benefits that sustained price stability will bring. The task ahead is to broaden and deepen the public's understanding of and support for the strategy and tactics of monetary policy and to lock in credibility for achieving low inflation, stable growth and lasting employment creation.","['macroeconomists', 'monetary', 'banking', 'inflationary', 'inflation']","['monetary policy', 'economists monetary', 'banking monetary', 'monetary regime', 'banks monetary']","['monetary policy europe', 'monetary regime europe', 'monetary policy macroeconomists', 'banks monetary policy', 'central banking monetary']"
1130,r010402a_ECB,euro area,2001-04-02,Consolidation of the payment systems industry: the Eurosystem's perspective,london,0,"I would first like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to present the Eurosystem's view on one of the most notable changes in the financial landscape in recent years, namely the significant acceleration of the consolidation process. Financial sector consolidation is of interest to the Eurosystem and other public authorities in various respects. Today, I would like to focus on its effects on payment systems and, more specifically, on the effects of certain developments in the correspondent banking business on euro payment systems. A major study has recently been conducted at the G10 level in order to enhance official and public understanding of the main trends in the field of consolidation, including their causes and consequences. As a result of this work, a Report on Consolidation in the Financial Sector was published in January 2001, which was prepared by a Working Party chaired by Roger W. Ferguson, Jr, Vice-Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. This report analyses the issue of consolidation in a very comprehensive manner and includes a separate chapter on the effects of consolidation on payment and settlement systems. Moreover, at the Eurosystem level, a survey was conducted between July and September 2000 - in co-operation with the Bank of England and other non-participating EU central banks - with the aim of identifying the main impact of Monetary Union on correspondent banking and other settlement arrangements in euro. The national central banks involved may well be presenting the results of this survey to the national banking community in their respective country in the course of this month. In the following discourse, I will first briefly describe the main trends in and the causes of consolidation. I will then explain why the Eurosystem is keen to pursue these developments and what the main policy conclusions are from our perspective. In a payment systems context, consolidation includes various developments in the financial sector whose common element is that they result in a higher degree of concentration of payment flows. In this sense, consolidation relates not only to institutional aspects (mergers and acquisitions), but also to reorganisational measures within individual financial institutions, specialisation and outsourcing processes and, not least, the market infrastructure. The high level of merger and acquisition (M&A) activity in recent years has relevant implications from a payment systems perspective. With a declining number of financial institutions, interbank transactions are increasingly becoming intrabank transactions (""on-us"" items). This may have positive effects on efficiency since these transactions do not involve external exchanges of payment messages via a traditional payment system. This point also raises certain concerns that I will come back to. Another implication is that M&As are usually followed by a rationalisation of the payment activities of the banks concerned. In addition, the global players emerging as a result of international M&As often have more demanding business needs towards the providers of payment and settlement systems. A second trend, which may be called , is the concentration by large international banks of a considerable proportion of their worldwide payment and cash management activities in one or a few operating centres. The establishment of CLS Bank is likely to bolster this trend. As a third trend, a process of can be identified. At the domestic level, this is not new in the savings and co-operative banking sector, where central institutions provide payment and back office services to smaller banks, usually from the same sector. More recently, so-called transaction banks have emerged which specialise in the provision of payment and back office services to other banks. Whether these initiatives will be successful depends, inter alia, on how future payments processing will be organised in the e-world. If open network structures in interbank connections were to enable banks to exchange certain kinds of payment transactions directly without an intermediary, the role of central ""processing factories"" could be heavily affected. Going beyond national boundaries, a concentration process has become evident in correspondent banking. This includes a reduction in both the numbers of correspondent banking accounts and market players. In turn, as the aforementioned ECB survey on developments in the EU has shown, the size of the correspondent banking business of a single credit institution can reach nearly EUR 40 billion per day. This is far more than the turnover of the smallest large-value euro payment system and almost half the daily turnover in 2000 of the third largest non-RTGS large-value euro payment system. The emergence of cross-border payment systems such as TARGET, Euro 1, STEP 1 (and, soon, CLS Bank) is on the one hand eroding the traditional ""bridging"" function of international correspondents. On the other hand, it is reshaping the services supply, as it enables correspondent banks to provide a broader range of services (e.g. by offering smaller banks a kind of indirect access to such systems) while, at the same time, covering a wider geographic area. Allow me here to digress briefly on the meaning of ""international"" and ""cross-border"" in the context of a single currency zone. All payments in euro within Euroland are to be considered ""domestic"" payments. This will be all the more so from 2002 thanks to the introduction of euro banknotes and coins: for payments in central bank money, the distinction between domestic and cross-border payments will disappear once and for all. Alas, this will not be entirely true for cross-border payments in commercial bank money, but today I do not want to deal with this issue, which is, as you know, one of the concerns of the Eurosystem. In Euroland, the term ""cross-border"" payments is just a convention to refer to payments across national boundaries. However, this term should by no means be taken as a synonym for ""international payments"", i.e. payments between two countries that have different currencies. Thus, a euro payment between London and Lisbon is an ""international"" payment, while a payment between Lisbon and Athens is a ""domestic"" payment that just happens to cross the borders of two euro area countries. Coming back to consolidation, the last type of consolidation to be considered here concerns the for making payments. The number of large-value payment systems in euro has decreased to five. However, this multiplicity of large-value payment systems in euro remains exceptional compared with that of other currency areas where both market forces and policy-makers have resulted in the creation of a single system (in the case of the United Kingdom) or two systems (as in the United States). In fact, a further consolidation has already been announced with the merger of the two German systems - EAF and ELS - into RTGS Plus, which will happen in September 2001. Let me now say a few words on the main . It is clear that, in a market economy, consolidation processes are ultimately aimed at reducing costs and/or increasing the revenue of the financial institutions concerned. While the profit motive is the main driving force, the form and pace of consolidation are determined by several environmental factors. Of course, there are also factors discouraging consolidation. However, I will leave them aside today. In general, the benefits of size and, hence, the incentive to make large investments basically arise from developments in information technology and from the internationalisation of the interbank and capital markets. The latter has been made possible by a general trend towards a deregulation and liberalisation of financial markets and is connected with sharply increasing cost-cutting pressures, inter alia, in the field of payment processing. Huge IT investments are usually needed to set up the required infrastructure or to maintain and improve the existing one. Therefore, only the institutions that have or can reach a ""critical mass"" in terms of the number of payments processed are able to write off these costs. Alternatively, they may, at the domestic level, outsource payment activities to transaction banks benefiting from economies of scale or, at the international level, leave this business to specialised correspondent banks acting on a global basis. At the European level, the introduction of the euro has - together with increased legal harmonisation - played a special role. The euro has eliminated the segmentation of local markets caused by the multiplicity of national currencies, thereby creating a bigger market in one single currency. Consequently, consolidation has been stimulated, as it widens the economies of scale and scope inherent in the clearing and settlement business. In fact, with regard to correspondent banking business, the ECB survey (confirming the findings of an earlier survey conducted in 1999) shows that the impact of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) on correspondent banking was substantial. The majority of banks now have just one correspondent account per euro area country, plus an additional account for back-up purposes. A further step towards higher concentration is expected in 2002 when the legacy currencies (which are still used for a large part of the commercial payments processed via correspondent banks) will cease to exist. Undoubtedly, the cash changeover in 2002 will be another milestone in the evolution of correspondent banking business in Europe. With regard to the payment systems infrastructure, the introduction of the euro has resulted in the inter-linking of the RTGS systems in the euro area and the establishment of TARGET. This was a requirement of the single monetary policy, and has proven to be a key factor in the unification of the euro money market. In the field of market infrastructure, the consolidation process is, however, to a large extent driven by major players located in countries both within and outside the euro area. These institutions normally participate in several systems and thus tend to request a greater harmonisation of these systems or even an amalgamation of infrastructures across borders in order to save the costs of the numerous interfaces they would otherwise need to maintain. I would now like to turn to the policy-related part of my presentation: why do central banks closely follow these developments? What conclusions does the Eurosystem draw from its analysis, in particular of the developments in correspondent banking? One of the basic tasks of the Eurosystem is to ensure the smooth functioning of the payment system. Like any central bank, the Eurosystem performs this task in two ways: by offering safe and sound payment and settlement services (TARGET) and by overseeing privately run payment systems to ensure that they comply with agreed standards. Of course, since substantial payment flows occur outside the ""official"" payment systems, looking solely at the soundness and efficiency of such systems would only provide a partial picture. This is why the Eurosystem considers that fulfilling its statutory task means looking at developments in the payments business as a whole, and not only overseeing payment systems. This is all the more relevant since, with developments in correspondent banking and the introduction of innovative payment arrangements (i.e. EuroSIC, the BACEE Payment and Clearing System (BNS)), is changing in Europe. Indeed, correspondent banking networks tend to acquire features that resemble those of payment systems. Both advanced correspondent banking and innovative payment arrangements combine features of ""traditional"" correspondent banking and of ""true"" payment systems. Like the former, they allow the users to forward payments to third parties who do not participate in the same scheme and provide a point of entry to one or more payment systems. At the same time, like the latter, such arrangements allow users to exchange payments among themselves and thus generate network externalities that are typical of payment systems: positive externalities, as the value of the arrangement increases the wider the participation; and negative externalities, as systemic risk may increase. In some ways, therefore, such arrangements ""do more"" than payment systems. Hence the interest of the Eurosystem. As I mentioned earlier, the concentration of correspondent banking business has reached a level where the of a single credit institution is sometimes comparable with that of a large-value payment system subject to Eurosystem oversight. Thus, since the soundness of systemically important payment systems is at the heart of central banks' responsibilities in the field of payment systems, as pointed out in the recent Report on Core Principles for Systemically Important Payment Systems produced by the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS), it goes without saying that the Eurosystem also pays close attention to the soundness of payment arrangements of comparable size. In addition, it is worth remembering that the consolidation of payment and settlement activities on a small number of major market players, all of whom participate in several payment systems, has an impact on the distribution of operational, financial and systemic risk (a higher risk of contagion). These are all risks that central banks typically aim to reduce via their payment systems policy. Central banks are also interested in the gains that consolidation and concentration of the payments business allow. Correspondent banking services are increasingly technology-intensive, and the choice of correspondents is clearly influenced by the quality of what is offered in terms of efficient and highly automated services. On the one hand, since huge IT investments are usually necessary, only big players can afford the large investments required to provide front-line services and to achieve economies of scale. On the other hand, further developments in e-technology and its low-cost availability to smaller banks may change this trend. Thus, while the end-result is not yet clear, efficiency considerations may push many smaller institutions to reconsider their positioning both in correspondent banking business and in terms of access to payment systems. Indeed, indirect participation comes closer to an ""enhanced"" correspondent banking service provided by direct participants. Of course, the Eurosystem is eager to understand the driving forces that may lead to a substantial change in the structure of . of payment arrangements is another relevant aspect being looked at by the Eurosystem. Some large correspondent banks have always had ""typical"" geographical orientations catering for the needs of specific banking communities abroad. This is not entirely new, in the sense that internationally operating banks have traditionally played this role, especially in countries whose currencies had a prominent role in the foreign exchange market before the introduction of the euro. However, the emergence of innovative payment arrangements in euro - like EuroSIC - have introduced new aspects in this respect. Such arrangements are also relevant from a policy perspective because they enable a non-EU banking community to access the euro payment system. On average in 2000, EuroSic processed nearly EUR 1.5 billion a day, with the larger share of payments in terms of value sent to counterparties who were not participating in the system but who could be reached via the connection to EAF and TARGET. While, for the time being, the limited turnover does not raise concerns, the Eurosystem wants to follow the development of such arrangements closely. Another aspect with policy relevance is the , as one of the duties of a central bank is to guarantee fair and open access to payment infrastructures. Privately run payment systems often have a co-operative structure that favours the internalisation of positive externalities and ensures that decisions are in the interests of participants. Clearly, the degree of openness of the club, and of its decision-making bodies, is crucial in this respect. Arrangements evolving from correspondent banking business are typically owned by a single private entity, and thus tend to be less open and transparent; there may not only be discriminatory problems in the definition and application of access criteria, but also problems in terms of the selection of operational features, the adoption of new technologies and standards, pricing policies, etc. From this point of view, there is a role for central banks in fostering fair and open access to all kinds of schemes. Last but not the least, consolidation in correspondent banking has an impact on the The use of central bank money as a settlement medium for certain kinds of transactions, in particular large-value payments, has always been a major part of central banks' risk reduction policies. This has been particularly true in the EU since 1993, when the Committee of Governors (the predecessor of the EMI Council and the ECB Governing Council) took the decision to foster the use of RTGS systems provided by the central bank as a key risk-reduction measure. This trend culminated in the introduction of TARGET, whereby nearly 70% (in terms of value) of the large-value payments in euro in the last two years were settled in central bank money. The recent developments in correspondent banking and the emergence of innovative payment arrangements that settle in the books of a commercial bank might affect the share of payments settled in central bank money and reverse this trend. Again, with reference to the Core Principle report, the importance of settlement in central bank money increases with the increase in the systemic importance of the arrangements. In any case, central banks have an interest in ensuring that the settlement agent, in whose books settlement is made, is sound, so that the commercial bank money used as the settlement asset carries very little financial risk. On the basis of the aforementioned considerations, the Eurosystem concluded that the policy relevance of advanced correspondent banking and innovative payment arrangements is not inferior to that of traditional payment systems. Consequently, the Eurosystem will continue to monitor their systemic importance and development closely. In this respect, a structured collection of statistics may be the necessary basis for further analysis. The second half of 2002 could be an appropriate point in time to undertake a new fully-fledged survey. At that time, the impact of the final changeover to the euro will have fostered a new wave of changes in correspondent banking relationships and will have further increased the level of concentration in the field. In the meantime, the Eurosystem will develop a policy line, including an oversight framework, for such schemes. The starting point for the elaboration of such a framework is the consideration that correspondent banking and innovative payment arrangements play a role very similar to that of traditional payment systems, without being subject to the specific risk management measures that apply to payment systems, which are requested to comply with agreed safety standards. In order to achieve a comprehensive and equitable regulatory framework in the payments area, the Eurosystem intends to consider all schemes whose function is comparable to that of a payment system. In this vein, it may consider whether agreed standards for payment systems might also be applicable to such schemes. The Core Principles - which were included in the set of oversight principles of the Eurosystem in January 2001 - can serve as a good starting point for further reflection in this matter. The Eurosystem shares the conclusions of the Report on Consolidation in the Financial Sector which highlights the benefits of close co-operation between banking supervisors and payment systems overseers in this area. The analysis of developments in correspondent banking and of the effects of consolidation in this field may be complemented by an exchange of information between oversight and supervisory authorities, so that the synergies that exist between the two perspectives are usefully exploited. The recently adopted ""Memorandum of Understanding between Payment Systems Overseers and Banking Supervisors in Stage Three of EMU"" could serve as a basis for exchanging information in this area as well.","['consolidation', 'banking', 'eurosystem', 'payments', 'bank']","['consolidation eurosystem', 'consolidation payment', 'bank eurosystem', 'consolidation financial', 'economy consolidation']","['consolidation explain eurosystem', 'sector consolidation eurosystem', 'consolidation eurosystem public', 'banking effects consolidation', 'effects consolidation payment']"
1162,r011017b_ECB,euro area,2001-10-17,Euro 2002 Information Campaign,duisenberg,1,"First of all, thank you very much for having invited me to speak at this Euro 2002 Information Campaign conference hosted by the Bank of Greece. This conference concludes the series of conferences organised by the European Central Bank (ECB) and the national central banks of the euro area, which have brought together more than 5,000 key players in the euro cash changeover process. These key players, which include several partners of the Euro 2002 Information Campaign, have benefited from the exchange of views and information, as this has enabled them to enhance their own preparations for the cash changeover. Moreover, the media attending these conferences have made the public more aware of the impending introduction of the euro banknotes and coins. My colleagues on the Executive Board and myself have been pleased to actively contribute to these conferences. In just over 75 days, "" "", will be in our pockets, and will finally become an everyday reality for all of us. In just over 75 days, we will be able to travel from one euro area country to another, from Athens to the Atlantic, without having to change our money. We will be able to compare prices for products and services much more easily - an enormous step that will give a major boost to competition and price transparency. In just over 75 days, companies and organisations will be able to expand their markets and pursue their activities without the cost and inconvenience of dealing with several currencies, even more so than after the irrevocable fixing of the exchange rates on 1 January 1999. In just over 75 days, Europeans will feel more at home in all Europe because, for the very first time, they will share the same banknotes and coins. Some people may not realise that the euro has in fact existed as a currency since 1 January 1999. The euro is already . Whenever we buy something with the current national banknotes of the euro area, we are in fact already paying for it in euro. The introduction of the euro banknotes and coins represents an unprecedented logistical challenge for all parties involved: almost 15 billion banknotes and around 50 billion coins are being produced, and a major proportion is being distributed first to the banking sector and then to the retail sector before finally reaching the public. These two steps, known as frontloading and sub-frontloading, started on 1 September and entail a gradual supply of euro banknotes and coins to different sectors of the economy in order to make the cash changeover process as smooth as possible. Of course, there will be a considerable demand for euro banknotes from outside the euro area and we have therefore adopted general principles and a guideline for the frontloading of euro banknotes to non-euro area residents. On 30 August, I unveiled the seven denominations of euro banknotes and their security features at a press conference in Frankfurt. The banknotes all show windows, gateways and bridges - symbols of openness and communication. They reflect Europe's artistic and architectural heritage and will, at the same time, help to promote a feeling of solidarity, to bring about new opportunities and to strengthen ties and transactions between the nations of Europe. But transactions need to be secure. The new banknotes include state-of-the-art security features, which will make the euro one of the world's safest currencies. The strength of the euro cash actually lies in the combination of these security features, several of which have already proved effective in many national banknotes. These features will provide reassurance: they will enable both the public and professional cash handlers to check the banknotes quickly and easily. Three simple tests - , , - which were described at the unveiling of the euro banknotes on 30 August and are being communicated in the context of the Euro 2002 Information Campaign, will enable the public to identify genuine euro banknotes in a matter of seconds. Particular care has also been taken with regard to the security features of the euro coins. The needs of the blind and partially sighted have also been carefully considered: they will be able to identify the banknotes with ease. The seven euro banknotes differ in size and colour, and the value of each banknote is printed in large, bold numbers. This will make it easier for all of us to recognise the banknotes when they enter into circulation on 1 January 2002. Ladies and gentlemen, this will be a watershed in Europe's history; it will be a unique event that requires our fullest support. It is crucial that we, the European Central Bank and the 12 national central banks of the euro area, do our utmost to ensure that the euro banknotes and coins are well received by the public. Their rapid acceptance will very much depend on how well we communicate on the subject of with the public at large. The more effectively we communicate, the more we will convince Europeans that Europe is not some abstract and remote idea, but an immediate and dynamic reality. The quality of the information we provide will determine how well people cope with the cash changeover and become accustomed to denominations that may differ from national ones. That's why the Governing Council of the ECB has launched an information campaign. We have the support of Publicis, a communications agency we selected for this historic task, and the national central banks of the euro area, which are implementing the information campaign and are also supplementing it with their own euro-related communications at a national level. Our campaign covers the practical aspects of the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins. It is not aimed only at people the euro area, but also at those it, such as tourists, travellers and citizens of countries where the predecessor currencies to the euro are used widely as parallel currencies. In order to reach such a broad public, the information campaign uses various groups and institutions as partners or ""multipliers"". These include banks, retailers, educational institutions, the tourism industry and the media. I would like to emphasise the key role these partners have been playing and are continuing to play. Here in Greece, as in the rest of Europe, partners of the Euro 2002 Information Campaign from both the public and private sectors are contributing to this important communication effort by conveying information on the euro banknotes and coins to their staff, customers and other target groups. More than 3,000 organisations have signed a partnership agreement with the ECB and the 12 national central banks of the euro area. I would also like to stress that the media are receiving special attention in the context of the campaign. For them, we have produced a total of six media kits, each marking a specific milestone in the countdown to the euro. These have been and will be distributed to more than 3,000 media representatives in the euro area in the course of 2001. The next media kit, E-50 (e minus fifty) or 50 days to go until E-day, which will be released in mid-November, will give an insight into the life cycle of a euro banknote. Furthermore, we are paying particular attention in the context of the campaign to vulnerable groups who need and will receive tailor-made information and training. We have now reached a crucial period in terms of our communications concerning the euro. Our mass media campaign, with TV and print ads across the euro area and beyond, has just been launched. The communications drive will continue into the first weeks of 2002, when the changeover will be under way and people will have the euro banknotes and coins in their hands and pockets. They will then be even more receptive to messages about the euro. In Greece, you have been able to see our TV commercials since 17 September and our print ads since 24 September. The creative concept here focuses on the positive spirit that comes from being part of a broad community with a single currency, and is reflected in the slogan . Since we cannot afford to miss a single opportunity to inform 300 million Europeans, 200 million public information leaflets, in 11 languages, have been produced, enough for every household in the euro area. The leaflet is entitled , and shows the euro banknotes with details of the security features and of the changeover plan for each country. The leaflet is tailored to the needs and circumstances of each country and will be distributed by the national central banks through a variety of channels. I would also like to mention our initiative to help the children of the euro area learn about the euro banknotes and coins. Seven million posters, each including a competition designed to raise awareness of the euro, are being distributed to primary schools. The competition, which runs until mid-November, must be one of the largest ever held for children aged between 8 and 12 in Europe. The lucky winners, our 24 "" "", two from each euro area country, will receive their prizes at an event that will take place in Frankfurt on 31 December. Let me turn to the ECB itself. At just over three years old, it is still a young central bank. Its mandate is to guarantee price stability by conducting a single monetary policy for the 12 countries and 300 million people in the euro area. The public perception of an institution sometimes differs sharply from, and even oversimplifies, complex reality. This is also the fate of the ECB. Its tasks are indeed complex, involving monetary policy decisions and operations, statistics, payment systems, legal issues, etc. However, its primary objective, as laid down in the Treaty establishing the European Community, is very clear, namely price stability in the euro area. In other words, safeguarding the value of the euro banknotes and coins and keeping inflation under control. Keeping control of inflation was and remains our main focus. The ECB has so far fulfilled its mandate successfully and aims to do so in the future for the benefit of Europe's citizens. Of course, the impact of the cash changeover on price developments in the coming months needs to be carefully monitored. Price transparency and market competition are likely to limit inflationary pressures stemming from the cash changeover. Still, I would like to appeal to all economic agents, including the governments, to strictly apply the rounding rules. We cannot afford such a momentous event being overshadowed by unjustified price increases. Any increases would undermine confidence in the euro and damage the credibility of those taking advantage of the cash changeover in such a way. The ECB is also asking the public to keep a close eye on prices during the changeover period and is encouraging consumers and various organisations to follow up any - may I say - abuse of the occasion. Another issue will become a major challenge for Europe once Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union has been finalised with the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins. I am referring to the enlargement of the European Union and, subsequently, of the euro area. Currently, 12 countries from central, eastern and southern Europe are negotiating to become members of the EU and eventually the euro area. Integrating such a large number of new applicants in the European Union - which would almost lead to a doubling of the current number of Member States - will be an enormous task for all parties involved, not least given the significant diversity of the economic conditions of most of these countries in relation to the current Member States. EU enlargement would not only have substantial implications for the accession countries, but also for the European Union itself. Considerable efforts are required to adapt the EU institutions and to adjust common policies in order to enable the EU to fully integrate the accession countries and, at the same time, retain its capacity to act. In preparing for enlargement, the Eurosystem has thus far contributed in its field of competence by initiating and maintaining an in-depth policy dialogue with the central banks of the accession countries and by offering technical assistance, mostly in the form of training courses and workshops: since January 2000 the Eurosystem has organised more than 400 activities with the accession countries' central banks, mainly in the area of payment systems, legal issues and statistics. As I have already mentioned, EU enlargement also has significant implications for the accession countries themselves. Let me briefly mention at least some of the main economic challenges which these countries are facing in this historic process. For them, the overriding goal of accession is indeed to catch up with the EU, both in real and in nominal terms. Thus, the accession countries are aiming to achieve the European Union's standard of living and macroeconomic and financial stability. This entails profound and comprehensive adjustments of the real economies and in the design of economic policies. While significant progress has already been made, further structural reforms are needed in the accession countries in order to transform their economies into fully-fledged market economies, so as to enable them to cope with competitive pressures and provide the conditions for sustainable and non-inflationary growth. Given the positive impact of structural reforms on the countries' disinflation processes, real and nominal convergence should preferably be pursued in parallel. In this context, sound fiscal policies also play a crucial role. Although the overall fiscal policy stance is satisfactory in most accession countries, some countries have recently experienced worrisome developments of their budget situations that seem to have become derailed from the path of sound fiscal policy. In this case, further efforts towards fiscal consolidation become crucial. The determined pursuit of fiscal consolidation is all the more necessary as the accession process and the completion of the transition phase are likely to place further demands on the budgetary situation, for example in relation to higher infrastructure investments or future reforms of the countries' health and social security systems. The magnitude and importance of the tasks that lie ahead undoubtedly represent a key challenge for all of us. However, this should not cloud our understanding of the forthcoming enlargement round as a historic opportunity and a step towards the ""unification"" of Europe. Ladies and Gentleman, let us look again at today's challenge, one which we are close to meeting. I know I am repeating myself, but it is important to be aware that on we are introducing the euro. The euro has been since . What we are doing is introducing the euro banknotes and coins. Then, for the very first time, 12 countries in Europe will share one currency: .

1226,r021111a_ECB,euro area,2002-11-11,The euro: a driving force in a globalised financial system,solans,0,"Ladies and gentlemen, it is a pleasure for me to participate in an event organised by the Official Spanish-Swiss Chamber of Commerce. Thank you for the invitation. Here in Zurich, which means outside the euro area, and at an event organised by an international chamber of commerce, I thought that the role of the euro in a globalised financial system could be an appropriate subject for my speech. One way to explain this role is to focus on the international role of the euro, which should be assessed keeping in mind the youthfulness of our central bank and our currency, but also the heritage it received from the national central banks of the Eurosystem and their currencies. In June next year the European Central Bank (ECB) and the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) will be five years old. The fact that not all members of the ESCB have adopted the euro made it necessary to introduce a new term to describe the ECB and the central banks of the European Union countries that have adopted the euro as their own currency and participate in the decisions on the common monetary policy of the euro area and related issues: this new term, which I mentioned before, is the ""Eurosystem"". Thus, the Eurosystem is de facto the central bank of the euro area in charge of the euro and the single monetary policy. Five years is a very short period of time in the normal life of a central bank. For example, the central bank of the Swiss Confederation, the Swiss National Bank, started business in 1907 to ""follow a monetary policy which serves the general interest of the country"" as set out in Article 99 of the Federal Constitution. Banco de Espana, to give another example, was created under the name Banco de San Carlos in 1782, which means that it is over two centuries old. Nevertheless, in less than five years the Eurosystem has become a fully-fledged central bank which formulates and implements a stability-oriented monetary policy, administers an efficient payment system and has created and developed the second most important currency of the world economy. A decisive step towards having a fully-fledged central bank for the euro area took place this year with the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins in the 12 countries of the system. It was, indeed, a very difficult logistical operation but ultimately a successful one thanks to the highly valuable co-operation of all the professional parties involved and, of course, the acceptance and, in some cases, even the enthusiasm of the European public. Incidentally, I am pleased to see that euro banknotes and coins are normally accepted in neighbouring countries such as Switzerland. The acceptance of euro banknotes and coins is the most tangible evidence of the success of the Eurosystem. The importance that the common euro banknotes and coins have as a catalyst not only for the economic but also for the social integration of Europe should not be belittled or underestimated. The euro banknotes and coins have enhanced the role that the euro is playing as an international currency since 1 January 1999. In a globalised financial system the existence of a new international currency is of paramount importance. The euro area as a whole is a source of economic and financial stability. The wide use of the euro in global markets and in exchange rate policies four years after its inception means that the euro area is ""exporting"" stability to the rest of the world. The Eurosystem, its monetary policy and, as a result, the stability of the euro is a relevant driving force, a catalyst, which has enhanced the economic and financial integration of the world economy. The first general conclusion that we reach when analysing the facts and figures is that the international role of the euro is growing gradually and steadily. Even taking into account the relevant fact that the euro inherited the international role previously played by some of the national currencies of the euro area states, namely the German mark and the French franc, our currency shows a constant and firm tendency towards greater internationalisation. The growing international role of the euro has some bearing on the Eurosystem's monetary policy. In this respect it should be mentioned that the ECB's monetary policy is based on a rather flexible strategy which is also consistent with the international role of the euro. Hence, having a world currency is an additional reason to take monetary policy decisions on the basis of flexible criteria, avoiding the inflexibility of a strategy based on rules. It is important to clarify that the growing international role of the euro is not the result of a policy goal set by the ECB. The ECB has adopted a neutral stance concerning the internationalisation of its currency, which implies that it neither fosters nor hinders this process. It rather accepts that the international role of the euro is mainly determined by the decisions of market participants in a context of increasing market integration and liberalisation at international level. The euro fulfils the necessary conditions to be a leading international currency alongside, rather than in competition with, the US dollar. There is enough room for both currencies in the world economy. The necessary conditions for a currency to become international are based on two broad factors: low risk and large size. The low risk factor is related to the confidence inspired by the currency and its central bank, which in turn mainly depends on the internal and external stability of the currency. Moreover, the low risk factor has to do with diversification among international currencies, since diversification is a means of reducing overall risk; it acts like a centrifugal force or a factor of dispersion. By contrast, the large size factor relates to the relative economic, financial and demographic importance of the area for which the currency serves as legal tender - in other words, the ""habitat"" of the currency. The large size factor generally favours centralisation around a few key international currencies. It can be seen as a centripetal force, a selective factor able to trigger a virtuous circle, which will tend to lead to the increasing use of the euro as an international currency. Let us consider these two factors in more detail. The first factor, low risk, concerns credibility and stability. The stability of the euro is a priority for the ECB. The basic factor that determines the importance of the euro as a widely used currency in the world economy, in addition to the economic, financial and demographic dimensions of the euro area, is, without a doubt, the stability of the new currency, understood as a means of maintaining its purchasing power. Stability is the basic requirement for a good currency. It is what we at the ECB sought for the euro. We want a stable euro and the euro will tend to derive strength from its stability. Does anyone know a stable currency that does not become a strong currency in the medium term? The stability of the euro is the basis for the confidence in and the credibility of the ECB, without which a large international role for the euro would be unthinkable. Stability is proof that the institution is performing well. Yet, in order to be credible, it is not sufficient for the ECB to maintain stability. Other parameters of its action must be considered: accountability, transparency, communication, etc. These parameters or conditions for the credibility of the euro are certainly demanding. However, the achievement of these conditions is the aim of all of us who have responsibilities with regard to the functioning of the Eurosystem. The second factor, which we have called the large size factor or the habitat of the euro, is important because without a certain critical mass a currency cannot achieve international relevance, regardless of its degree of stability. The figures for the population and the GDP of the euro area (based on data for 2000) illustrate this. With 305 million inhabitants, the euro area population exceeds that of the United States (283 million) and Japan (127 million). On the other hand, the GDP of the euro area (EUR 6,572 billion) amounts to 75% of the GDP of the United States, but is 225% larger than that of Japan. However, even more important than the current figures is the potential for the future development of the euro area, in terms of population and GDP, if and when the so-called ""pre-ins"" (Denmark, Sweden and the United Kingdom) join the Eurosystem. The entry of these countries would result in a monetary area of 379 million inhabitants, 34% higher than the United States' population and almost triple that of Japan, with a GDP of EUR 8,188 billion, only slightly less than US GDP and 281% higher than Japan's. All these facts and figures which demonstrate the economic and demographic importance of the European Union would be further strengthened by enlargement to eastern Europe, if and when the accession countries join the euro area. If we consider an enlarged euro area with both the pre-ins and the 12 accession countries, then on the basis of 2000 data the resulting economic area would have a GDP of EUR 9,070 billion, slightly higher than that of the United States and three times that of Japan. The gap would be even wider in terms of population, since the resulting area would have 484 million inhabitants, 159% of the United States' population and 381% of Japan's. The size or habitat of an economy depends not only on economic and demographic factors; it also depends on the financial base or dimension of the area. Considering the financial dimension of the euro area, the first relevant feature to observe is the smaller role played by the stock markets in the euro area in comparison with the United States. Although this feature could give the impression that the euro area has a relatively small financial dimension in relation to its economic dimension, this is not the case. The lower degree of development in capital markets is offset by a higher degree of banking assets. This means that the financial base of real economic activity in Europe is largely founded on bank intermediation, which is also a feature of the Japanese economy. For example, bank credit in the euro area amounts to 136% of GDP, while in the United States it is only 104%. Conversely, debt securities represent 108% of GDP in the euro area compared with 162% of GDP in the United States. There are therefore some differences in financing (albeit increasingly fewer) that have to be taken into account when assessing Europe's financial dimension compared with that of the United States and Japan. The extension of the habitat of the euro to include the United Kingdom would certainly change the terms of the financial comparison between the United States and the euro area. Without a doubt, the euro area would benefit from embracing the world's second-largest financial market, exactly as the world's second-largest financial market would benefit from adopting the second world currency. In this respect I could even favour a marriage of convenience: if not for love, then at least for money (!). Prudence makes me refrain from extending the metaphor to the Zurich financial market, although I hope that in the Swiss case the weight attributed to love and money would be different. The euro, the ECB's monetary policy and, in general, the activity of the ECB and of the Eurosystem play a key role in the integration of European financial markets and all markets in general. The euro is acting as a catalyst for European economic integration. And more integration will lead to a greater economic and financial dimension. Two very general aspects can be considered when assessing the international role of the euro. First, its use in global markets, i.e. securities markets, foreign exchange markets and markets for goods and services trade with countries outside the euro area. The second aspect to be considered is the use of the euro in third countries, both by the authorities as an anchor, reserve and intervention currency for their exchange rate policies and by private agents as a parallel currency in the form of cash holdings or foreign currency deposits. In the international debt securities markets (i.e. leaving aside international equities which have a more limited statistical coverage) the share in outstanding amounts of euro-denominated instruments issued by non-residents totals 29%, compared with 44% for the US dollar and 13% for the Japanese yen. Available information point to a widening gap between an increasing euro share in the supply of international bonds and a flat - or even slightly receding - share in the demand for such securities outside the euro area, which suggests that a significant and increasing share of euro international issues is being absorbed by euro area investors. Non-resident issues are concentrated in the United States and the rest of Europe, while emerging market economies make only a limited use of the euro, with the exception of those that are geographically close to the European Union. Debt securities issued in euro by non-residents account for 11% of the total issuance of euro-denominated debt securities markets (domestic and international), compared with a share of 9% in the case of the US dollar and 6% for the Japanese yen. This allows me to draw the conclusion that, in relative terms, non-resident issuers are more active in euro debt securities markets than they are in dollar or yen debt securities markets. If we move from the supply side to the demand side, i.e. if we change our perspective from the use that issuers in debt markets make of the euro to the use of the euro by security holders, we can conclude that the share of euro-denominated bonds in portfolios directly managed by US financial institutions is insignificant, while, in contrast, this share is substantial (around 30%) in non-euro area European economies. In particular, the role played by the City of London is prominent, as more than half of the over-the-counter activity in secondary markets for international bonds is in euro-denominated securities. In foreign exchange markets, the US dollar remains the global vehicle currency for transactions between almost all currency pairs, with the exception of some Nordic and eastern European countries where the euro appears to be playing this role. The fact is that the share of the euro in global spot trading amounts to about 20%, a percentage broadly similar to that of the Deutsche Mark in the past. In the case of swap trading, the euro's share has decreased compared to the share of the Deutsche Mark. Of course, it is important to take into account when assessing this fact that, with the introduction of the euro, former foreign exchange operations between the Twelve became domestic operations. As members of an international chamber of commerce you will be interested to know that available data show a significant rise in the use of the euro for goods and services trade between the euro area and countries outside the Monetary Union, both for imports and exports. Data show that about one half of the euro area's external trade is conducted in euro. The use of the euro by public authorities in countries outside the euro area as an anchor, reserve and intervention currency is gradually increasing. Some 50 countries, with relatively small economies and mainly located close to the euro area, use the euro in their exchange rate regimes. These exchange rate regimes comprise: euroisation, either unilaterally (Kosovo, Montenegro, Andorra) or within the framework of monetary agreements (San Marino, Vatican City, Monaco, Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon, Mayotte); euro-based currency boards (Bulgaria, Estonia, Lithuania, Bosnia-Herzegovina); peg arrangements based on the euro (CFA Franc Zone, French overseas territories, Cape Verde, etc.); peg arrangements based on a basket involving the euro to a greater or lesser extent, in some cases through the use of the Special Drawing Rights (SDR) (Latvia, Malta, Israel (which has a crawling peg with an automatically widening band), Seychelles, Kuwait, Morocco, Jordan, Libya, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, etc.); managed floating with the euro as the reference currency (Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Yugoslavia, Tunisia) and last but not least the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM II), either officially (Denmark) or through a unilateral shadowing of ERM II (Cyprus, Hungary). At the end of 2001, 13% of the identified official holdings of foreign reserves in the world were in euro, compared with 68.3% for the US dollar, 4.9% for the Japanese yen, 4% for the pound sterling and 0.7% for the Swiss franc. Recent official statements from several countries (China, Korea, Russia, Pakistan, Romania, etc.) indicate that these countries have increased their share of euro-denominated foreign exchange reserves or intend to do so. The use of the euro as a reserve currency is, of course, related to its use as an anchor and intervention currency: we can assume that the countries with exchange rate regimes involving the euro will keep a relatively higher share of euro in their foreign reserves. This is certainly the case of Croatia, Latvia and Slovakia, which publish the composition of their international reserves on their websites. We also know that in June 2002 the United Kingdom kept 53% of its foreign assets in euro, the United States 51%, Canada 39% and Australia 37%. A relevant aspect of the international role of the euro is its use as a parallel currency by the private sector outside the euro area. I said before that the acceptance of the euro banknotes and coins is the most tangible evidence of the success of the Eurosystem. I can add now that the success of the euro cash changeover outside the euro area and the use of euro banknotes in third countries provide the most tangible evidence of the international dimensions of our currency. The success of the euro cash changeover outside the euro area was based on the ECB Governing Council's decision to allow frontloading and sub-frontloading of euro banknotes to private credit institutions and to central banks outside the Eurosystem well in advance of the changeover (as of 1 December 2001, to be exact), subject to specific terms and conditions. Some 26 central banks were frontloaded, mainly in central and eastern Europe, the Mediterranean area and Africa. The initial frontloading of euro banknotes outside the euro area plus cumulated net shipments, i.e. euro banknotes sent abroad minus euro banknotes received, amounted to some EUR 23 billion by the end of June 2002, around 7.5% of the euro's total circulation. It would be extremely difficult to know the specific final destinations of the shipped banknotes because large amounts were transferred to international banks based in industrialised countries, like Switzerland and the United Kingdom, which then redistributed them around the world. If we compare the present circulation of euro banknotes outside the euro area with estimates of the circulation of the former national banknotes, mainly Deutsche Mark but also French francs and Austrian schillings, a gap of at least EUR 10 billion appears. This gap can be explained by three factors: euro legacy currencies not yet converted to euro; a switch from euro legacy currencies to banknotes denominated in other currencies, especially in the run-up to the cash changeover; and euro asset substitution through the conversion of legacy banknotes into euro-denominated deposits. In co-operation with the central banks of neighbouring countries the ECB has collected information on the scale of the last factor I mentioned, the euro asset substitution. The main conclusion is that euro-denominated deposits rose significantly in the months preceding the cash changeover, by more than EUR 13.5 billion in total. The conclusion seems clear: euro asset substitution is the main factor which explains the existing gap between euro banknotes and legacy banknotes circulating outside the euro area. This conclusion is extremely positive because it implies that all the parties involved in the changeover gained from it: the authorities welcomed the strengthening of banking sectors, banks benefited from the increase in their deposit base and households were able to conduct the changeover at low risk and low cost. These developments imply that the euro increasingly circulates in scriptural form rather than in paper form, although some economies are still largely cash based. In any case, be it in the form of banknotes or deposits, the conclusion that matters when analysing the role of the euro as a driving force in a globalised financial system is that our currency plays a relevant role as a parallel currency outside the euro area. Ladies and gentlemen, in conclusion I would say the following. In all its different forms - as debt instruments, bank deposits, banknotes -, in different operations - foreign exchange, international trade -, and for different purposes - exchange rate policies, holdings of official reserves, private store of value -, the fact is that the international role of the euro is gradually growing and that it is the most widely used international currency after the US dollar and ahead of the Japanese yen. This means that savers and investors, banks and real sector companies, public authorities and citizens around the world are increasingly prepared to use the euro as a store of value, a medium of exchange and a unit of account, the three basic functions of money. If this is so it is because they have confidence in the quality of the euro, i.e. in its internal and external stability. The Eurosystem will of course honour this confidence.

1285,r031103c_ECB,euro area,2003-11-03,Monetary policy in uncharted territory,issing,0,"Richard Stone contributed since the early 40s to the development of national accounts systems. Sixty years later it is clear that national accounts systems have greatly contributed to empirical and policy-relevant economic research. Timely and accurate statistics are, in Europe and elsewhere, as important as at the time of Stone's original contributions. Even more remarkably, these contributions, which were part of the dissemination of Keynesian ideas, have been accepted and used by all schools of economic thought. They are, in this respect, ""robust"" analytical tools, of the sorts which are mostly appreciated and needed in all fields of economics, but especially in monetary policy analysis. It is a pleasure and a privilege for us, Vitor Gaspar and me, to give the Stone lecture for 2003. My plan is to elaborate on the difficulties of designing monetary policy under uncertainty, with special emphasis on those created by the occurrence of unprecedented historical events. As a former professor of monetary economics, my first instinct in these instances is to rush back to the comfortable world of academic research, where one has the freedom to draw a line and only discuss issues that fall on one's favourite side of that line. I suppose I still have a soft spot for the beauty of impeccable demonstrations descending from one's postulated assumptions by force of logical consistency. As a policy-maker for 13 years now, however, I have also learnt that real world economies are rarely seduced by that notion of beauty. When formal elegance becomes an end - rather than a means to an end - for theoretical research, theory risks being of little help as a guide for practical decision making. Thus, almost 300 years ago, Adam Smith warned: ""The man of system (...) is often so enamoured with the supposed beauty of his own ideal plan of government, that he cannot suffer the smallest deviation from any part of it. (...) He seems to imagine that he can arrange the elements of a great society with as much ease as the hand arranges different pieces upon a chessboard. He does not consider that the pieces upon the chess board have no other principle of motion besides that which the hand impresses upon them; but that, in the great chess board of human society, every single piece has a principle of motion of its own, altogether different from that which the legislature may choose to impress upon it"". In this lecture, I will try to illustrate how ""science"" based on academic theories and evidence and the ""art of central banking"" can usefully interact to produce superior outcomes in the field of monetary policy. I will argue that some fundamental results of monetary theory, which are robust across empirical analyses and theoretical models, must be placed at the core of any monetary policy strategy. I will also argue, however, that the filter of experience and judgement is necessary to bridge the gap from the naivety of available theoretical models to the complexities of real world economies. This mix of theoretical foundations and pragmatic application is especially useful at times of extraordinarily high uncertainty, as in the case of historical transformations. I will illustrate these ideas with reference to two such events, which I had to face in my central banking life: German unification and the launch of the European Monetary Union. How does monetary theory suggest central banks should deal with uncertainty? The answer is dependent on the particular form of uncertainty depicted in the analysis. First, there is uncertainty on prevailing economic conditions. This is mostly related to the need of filtering from observable data the level of latent variables - like the output gap, equilibrium real interest rates, or various measures of excess liquidity - and to the process of identification and interpretation of the nature of the shocks driving observed economic developments. By and large, the recent literature seems to consider this source of uncertainty as easy to deal with, by virtue of certainty equivalence. The world in which certainty equivalence is known to apply, however, is one where the model of the economy is linear, shocks are additive and the policy- maker preferences are quadratic. More importantly, certainty equivalence relies on perfect knowledge of the true model of the economy. When this assumption does not hold, monetary theorists speak of model uncertainty. This, in turn, can take the form of parameter uncertainty, namely imperfect knowledge of the parameters which characterise elasticities and functional dependencies within any particular model. Brainard's so-called conservatism principle is probably the most widely quoted result on how to deal with parameter uncertainty. A large body of recent evidence, however, has pointed out that conservatism is not a robust outcome. An aggressive, rather than cautious, response to inflationary shocks, for example, is advisable when there is uncertainty on the exogenous degree of inflation persistence. More fundamentally, model uncertainty implies ambiguity of the model which should provide a suitable description of the structural relationships in the economy. On this issue, I will simply quote a distinguished researcher like Ben McCallum, who states: ""it is not just that the economics profession does not have a well-tested quantitative model of the quarter-to-quarter dynamics, the situation is much worse than that: we do not even have any basic agreement about the qualitative nature of the mechanism."" Once all sources of state and model uncertainty are compounded, as is the case in the real world, monetary analysis can offer hardly any robust guideline on how policy should react to shocks of unknown nature. The lack of consensus on the most appropriate model of economic dynamics leads to conceptual ambiguities and empirical difficulties when trying, for example, to determine the best course of policy, to identify the relevant economic shocks and their persistence, to estimate unobservable variables. But this is not the end of uncertainty. A third class of uncertainty is that due to the endogeneity of expectations. The central bank sometimes wonders about the reaction of economic agents and financial markets to its own policy decisions and announcements. Conversely, economic agents may be unsure about the precise motivations and actions of central banks and other economic agents. In the realm of monetary policy, the level of uncertainty stemming from endogenous expectations is mainly, and inversely, related to central bank credibility. Luckily, in this field we do have some robust policy results. In order to ensure credibility and anchor inflation expectations, a central bank should be independent and the goal of pursuing price stability should be attributed priority in its statute or mandate. A firm response to inflationary shocks is also necessary, especially if agents take into account the possibility that the anti-inflationary determination of the central bank may wane over time. Finally, the announcement of a monetary policy strategy also contributes to dispel uncertainty on the actions of the central bank. All the aforementioned sources of uncertainty constantly play a role in day-to-day monetary policy making in all countries, but they reach exceptional heights at the time of historical events such as German unification and EMU. How can central banks deal with these situations? How did the Bundesbank and the ECB do it? In October 1990 I left university where I had spent all my professional life so far and was appointed member of the Executive Board of the Deutsche Bundesbank. From the first day I was entrusted with the portfolio which had been in the hands of Helmut Schlesinger - at that time Vice President - for almost twenty years. This implied not only responsibility for the business areas Economics and Statistics but also the presentation of economic analysis and monetary policy conclusions to the Board and the bimonthly meetings of the Council (""Zentralbankrat""), i.e. the highest decision making body. Responsibility for the Monthly Report, the very influential publication of the Bundesbank was also part of the portfolio. At that time the Bundesbank was already one of the most respected central banks in the world with a unique track record as an inflation fighter. The Bundesbank had been able to counter inflationary shocks, most of which were international, more effectively than other central banks. German year-on-year inflation never in fact reached double-digit figures in the seventies. Germany experienced a prolonged inflationary shock, but the so-called Great inflation that plagued the United States and many other countries never really took hold of Germany. The institutional arrangement of the Bundesbank undoubtedly played a fundamental role in achieving these outcomes. The law on the Bundesbank provided independence to the central bank and mandated it with the goal of ""safeguarding the stability of the currency"". The Bundesbank had been very successful in communicating that this was to be understood as safeguarding the ""internal stability"", i.e. synonymous to maintaining price stability. In December 1974, as the first central bank in the world, the Bundesbank pre-announced a target for the growth rate of money for the following year - more precisely, 8% for the central bank money stock in the course of the year. It repeated this practice every year until the end of being responsible for its currency the D-Mark, i.e. until entering European Monetary Union with the introduction of the euro. At the core of the monetary targeting strategy was Milton Friedman's dictum that in the long run inflation is always a monetary phenomenon and that therefore developments of prices over longer horizons are determined by the expansion of money. The Bundesbank had never considered the idea of controlling any form of base money or of pursuing monetary targets over the short-term. In fact, over 24 years of monetary targeting, it adapted some details of its strategy several times, e.g. moving to announce target corridors rather than single-figure targets or, from 1988 onwards, choosing the broad aggregate M3 instead of the central bank money stock. Moreover, the Bundesbank did never react in a mechanical way to M3 developments. The term ""pragmatic monetarism"" was sometimes used to describe this strategy. The strategy was based on an application of the quantity equation. It required that, for given price norm, the growth of the money stock adjusted for the long-term change in velocity should be in line with potential output growth. Thus, the derivation of the monetary target took trend variables and normative elements into account. The Bundesbank always considered its strategy of monetary targeting as a medium-term approach. Incidentally, an important role for money based on the quantity equation can be seen as consistent with the ideas of Sir Richard Stone. In his Nobel lecture, Sir Stone emphasised that accounting can be useful ""in describing and understanding society."" He added that ""by organising our data in the form of accounts we can obtain a coherent picture of the stocks and flows, incomings and outgoings of whatever variables we are interested in [....] and thence proceed to analyse the system of which they form part."" Along these lines, the quantity equation is the accounting identity which provides a coherent picture of the ""incomings and outgoings"" of inflation. For the Bundesbank, it formed the starting point for a broader analysis of future inflationary prospects, based on a set of monetary, financial and real economic indicators. Up to 1990 the strategy as such had proven to work well and seemed superior to any available alternative. So, what could be easier than simply continuing with such a successful strategy? The first major challenge for the newcomer in the Executive Board was to prepare the document for the proposal for the monetary target for 1991 and present it to the Council. Should the case of German unification make any difference? No doubt, the situation was substantially dissimilar from previous years. The introduction of the D-Mark on 1 June 1990, which preceded political unity on 3 October 1990, had influenced the environment for monetary policy in the direction of increased uncertainty. Whereas the introduction of the D-Mark in the still GDR was a logistical masterpiece, the conversion of GDR-Mark holdings into D-Mark initially led to an expansion in the money stock which had to be considered as overly generous. The money supply in East Germany increased by an amount roughly equivalent to 15% of the West German money stock. However, based on the estimated national product of the former GDR at market prices, - which later turned out to be far too optimistic - an increase of the money supply of only some 10% would have been appropriate. But, this was the result of applying standards from West Germany in the past. Was this appropriate? In deriving its monetary target for 1991 -- a 4 to 6 % band as in the previous year - the Bundesbank ignored this monetary overhang. Over 1991, as it observed a limited reversal in east German demand for money when households in the new Lander geared their portfolios to the longer term, the Council - for the first and only time - made use of the regular proviso when announcing the target and revised its target corridor to 3-5 % in the context of the mid-year review of the monetary target. The greater uncertainty was related to the possibility, and if realised the extent, of a change in the trend of the demand for money in reunited Germany with respect to that in the old Federal Republic. Would reconstruction require increased monetary support, particularly in view of the East German enterprises' lack, or at least very inadequate provision, with own funds? The diverging trends in the individual sectors of the east, especially in the first years after unification, tended to support this conjecture, as they suggested a need for increased intermediation by the banking system between lenders and borrowers - a phenomenon known as the ""straddle effect"" which had been a subject for discussion since the sixties. One had also to expect that the demand for money might be affected by the dramatic swing in the current account, from a surplus of over 100 billion DM in 1989 to a deficit of over 30 billion DM in 1991. And finally, but pointing rather in the opposite direction, there was a marked difference between income and wealth in the east and the west. How could these factors be taken into account when estimating money demand for the broad aggregate M3? The ultimate question was: could the Bundesbank still assume that the long-term stability of money demand would be unchallenged by the impact of reunification and allow for continuation of monetary targeting? An answer had to be given without the help of formal econometric evidence. It was only ex post that empirical studies by Scharnagl showed that these disruptions in monetary developments were only of a temporary nature and did not fundamentally call into question the monetary targeting strategy. A final aspect contributed to specific difficulties related to monetary targeting in reunified Germany. Unification led to a massive expansionary shock and to high deficits in public budgets. Indeed, the public sector moved from a balanced position in 1989 to a huge deficit, while public sector indebtedness, including the previously off budget funds, increased from 41% to 60% of GDP between 1989 and 1996. As a consequence of these expansionary policies and strong wage increases, inflation in Germany quickly rose. In West Germany, it exceeded 4% in the second half of 1991 and the first half of 1992 and remained at levels above 2% until early 1994. When setting the monetary targets during this period it was obvious that inflation may temporarily exceed the normative rate set so far at 2 %. The Bundesbank's medium- term oriented policy would not aim to reduce the inflation rate in a short period of time by a dramatic restrictive monetary policy move, but it would try in the first place to prevent inflation from running adrift, not allowing financing of second round effects of price hikes driven by increases in direct taxation and bringing down inflation towards the norm over the medium term. How to preserve credibility for monetary policy under these circumstances? The first option was, as had already happened at the beginning of the practice of monetary targeting, to derive the monetary target based on a rate for ""unavoidable inflation"" which had to be above 2 %. The risk implicit in this approach was that a rate declared ""unavoidable"" by the Bundesbank, and whose exact value was difficult to estimate ex ante, would set a kind of floor to inflation expectations and enter as such all kinds of nominal contracts. In this context, it had to be taken into account that the inflation rise following German reunification had been due to demand pressures while in the middle of the seventies and the early eighties oil price shocks had been driving inflation upwards. The advantage of the approach would be that of acknowledging the possibility of temporary increases in the rate of growth of money, because of the inflationary effects of reunification. The other option was to stick to the normative rate of 2 % for inflation in the derivation of the monetary target. Given the orientation of bringing inflation down gradually, this implied that the Bundesbank would be ready, for a limited period of time, to accept a higher rate of monetary expansion than announced in its target. This kind of tolerable, near-future overshooting was obviously inconsistent with a dogmatic interpretation of the monetary targeting strategy. At the same time, however, it would convey the central role of the inflation norm in the strategy and the fact that this was not subject to short-run revisions simply due to the arrival of shocks - not even exceptional ones. This option could therefore be seen as more effective in anchoring expectations at a delicate historical juncture. The Bundesbank chose the second approach giving a clear signal that, even under the specific circumstances of German unification, 2 % remained the norm for inflation. In its publications of all kinds the Bundesbank tried to explain the implications of this approach. To my - certainly partisan, but not necessarily biased - judgement, this decision convinced the public and financial markets of the Bundesbank's unchanged orientation towards price stability. It also contributed to the result that in the end inflation was overcome faster and with a smaller output loss than anticipated by most observers. Great concerns on the European level arose when the Bundesbank tightened monetary policy substantially to counter strong inflationary pressures after unification. Within the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the EMS, the impact of the Bundesbank's monetary policy was immediately transmitted to the other members. Exchange rates came under pressure, as these countries were not able to react accordingly by adjustment of other macroeconomic variables. Objections against, and criticism of, German monetary policy were soon being voiced. The argument was that the Bundesbank, as the de facto European Central Bank, should orient its policy not only to the situation in Germany but also with a view to the partner countries. This combined with arguments from inside Germany, by quite a number of politicians and also business leaders, to put aside the focus on price stability under the unique historical circumstances, until the major challenges by German unification had been mastered. How did the Bundesbank react under strong pressure from inside and outside the country? The Bundesbank explained that there was a law with a clear mandate for the stability of the D-Mark, a goal. Moreover, it was convinced that it would be wrong to see a contradiction between this orientation and the interests of the European partner countries. May I just quote from a speech I gave on 5 June 1992 at the Paolo Baffi Centre for Monetary and Financial Economics of Bocconi University in Milan: ""A central bank's reputation substantially results from its past policy record and its corresponding success in fighting inflation. This reputation provides the basis for the credibility of its current and future work. The European Central Bank is starting out into monetary union from scratch as it were; it has yet to earn a reputation by conducting a sound monetary policy. The European Central Bank can only win confidence in this difficult initial phase by ""inheriting"", as it were, the tradition of the Bundesbank and other major central banks with a high reputation. It will no doubt succeed in doing this only if the Community enters monetary union at a point in time characterised not only by virtual stability but also in which partner countries can look back on as long a period as possible of stable conditions....... The Bundesbank therefore believes that, in pursuing its counter-inflationary policy, it is acting responsibly both nationally and internationally. The ambitious goal of replacing national currencies by a single common European currency by the end of this decade and of the century can only be met satisfactorily if such a step is backed by nations which are deeply convinced that in the final analysis inflation is not a means of really solving problems but an evil which at the end of the day merely compounds existing problems and creates new ones. It would be a dangerous illusion to hope that this lesson could be learnt overnight, as it were, namely with the beginning of the European Monetary Union."" One important aspect - supporting this view - has to be added. It was obvious that it would be very difficult to convince the German public of the need to give up the D- Mark for the sake of a single currency in Europe. Germans with the bad experience of their history were suspicious of any kind of ""monetary reform"" and, with all European enthusiasm which was prevalent, they were extremely reluctant to embrace the project of EMU. Any notion that a ""European orientation"" might imply less price stability would have been disastrous for the project of monetary union. In the end this might have undermined the acceptance of the single currency also in other countries as people were eager to have a common, but in the first place a stable, new currency. The German central bank had created a stability culture, which set a benchmark. Eventually, all European central banks embraced this culture of stability. Only against this successful experience it was feasible that the statute of the ECB was designed in the same spirit as the Bundesbank law, with the major elements of independence and a clear mandate to maintain price stability. Hence, what about the experience of the Bundesbank's monetary policy as a recommendation, an advice for the future ECB's policy? As early as 1993 I was invited to address the issue of ""Monetary policy strategy in the EMU"" at a conference organised by De Nederlandse Bank. Here I will not go into the details, but I tried to explain the special circumstances the new central bank would be confronted with, stressed the need for a clear concept - a strategy -, discussed the prerequisites for monetary targeting - stability of money demand etc. -, and came to the conclusion that the ECB should indeed adopt a strategy of monetary targeting. One major argument in favour of this approach was to transfer by that as far as possible credibility and reputation to the new institution which had to start without a track record of its own. In the end, when the time came however, I did not propose monetary targeting as a strategy for the ECB. While the empirical evidence available in late 1998 suggested that the demand for M3 for a sample of currencies joining EMU was stable and that M3 growth displayed leading indicator properties for inflation, taking such an approach appeared to be very risky - in the end much too risky. Unavoidably, all these econometric studies were based on a period when monetary policy had not been in the hands of a unique institution. Hence, behavioural changes due to a regime shift after the start of Stage Three had to be given high probability. Moreover, the pragmatic approach the Bundesbank could take towards monetary targeting without risking a loss of credibility was less suited for the ECB, a new institution which still had to built up its reputation. In the same vein, any significant change of the monetary policy strategy, such as a change of the key monetary aggregate soon after the start of monetary union, could have seriously hampered the ECB's credibility. Against this background, there were a number of good reasons to choose a broader-based and more robust monetary policy strategy. The ECB's monetary policy strategy is nevertheless another illustration of a commitment to a procedural framework, which may overcome some of the limitations and risks associated with more narrowly defined monetary policy rules. First and foremost, the strategy includes a clear commitment to the goal variable, i.e. the primary objective of price stability. In October 1998, the Governing Council declared that price stability would be defined ""as year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%"". In May 2003, after an extensive review of the strategy, the Governing Council clarified that, within the definition of price stability, monetary policy would aim to maintain the inflation rate below, but close to, 2%. This clarification aims to shed light on the ECB's commitment to maintain a sufficient ""safety margin to guard against the risks of deflation"", while also addressing ""the issue of the possible presence of a measurement bias in the HICP and the implications of inflation differential within the euro area"". A fundamental aspect of the definition is that ""price stability is to be maintained over the medium term"". The medium term orientation shows two important general features of the strategy. The first is the choice to adopt a gradual approach in the return to price stability after a disturbance, hence avoiding any unnecessary volatility in output and interest rates. The second feature is an explicit acknowledgement of the existence of lags in the monetary policy transmission mechanism: shorter-term oriented policies would only have the consequence of introducing further noise in the economy. The strategy also puts forward a robust approach, especially important given the need to cope with the particularly high degree of uncertainty and imperfect knowledge prevailing at the beginning of Stage Three of EMU. This is reflected in the choice to base the assessment of the risks to price stability on two analytical perspectives, referred to as ""pillars"": ""economic analysis"" and ""monetary analysis"". Accordingly, the stability-oriented strategy recognises the need for scrutinising all available information, based on a wide set of economic indicators, in order to improve policy decisions. At the same time, the strategy acknowledges the connection between money and price developments in the medium to long run as one of the most robust known economic relationships. Naturally, the link between money and prices tends to be stronger over the medium to long term, whereas in the short run several factors may lead to unexpected shifts in the velocity of circulation. A variety of indicators of domestic and international cost and price factors often provide a reasonably accurate account of near-term price developments. Therefore, it seems natural to attribute a relatively more important role to the latter indicators in forming a judgement about short term price developments, while shifting progressively the emphasis on ""money"" as the horizon of the assessment lengthens and uncertainty widens. There are obvious similarities between the ECB strategy and the Bundesbank's monetary targeting. In particular, the ECB also relies on money to keep a steady sense of direction for the medium term. This was a deliberate element of continuity with the past, which has arguably enhanced the initial credibility of the ECB. At the same time, the ECB strategy is clearly different from monetary targeting in its attributing greater emphasis to the need to take all relevant information and models into account when formulating policy decisions. From the very beginning, the ECB strategy also made the medium term relevance of money more explicit, as conveyed by the announcement of a reference value for the rate of growth of M3 over the medium term, rather than a monetary target for the year ahead. Since the medium term trend assumptions underlying the derivation of the reference value for M3 are not expected to change frequently, in May 2003 the ECB announced its decision to discontinue its regular annual review of the reference value. In the first few years of EMU, economic and monetary analyses provided useful, but difficult to extract, information in equivalent respects. For example, the output gap, which plays a central role in neo-keynesian recommendations for monetary policy, has proven difficult to estimate precisely for the euro area - the same is true elsewhere. Two causes of this difficulty are well known. The first is that the output gap is a latent variable, which is never observed exactly over time. The second is that the gap is, from a theoretical viewpoint, an elusive concept. Its definition is clearly dependent on the model used to define the ""equilibrium output"" benchmark and various possible benchmarks have been proposed over time. Existing evidence shows that different definitions - for example the theoretically-consistent ones derived within general equilibrium models and the more empirically oriented ones based on less restrictive economic assumptions - yield substantially different estimates for the gap. All in all, it seems prudent to look at the results produced by a wide diversity of alternative techniques, but it is difficult to see how the output gap could play in practice the fundamental role that it is sometimes attributed in theory. Has monetary analysis provided easy-to-extract information? Not really. As expected, monetary analysis has proven to be also difficult, although these difficulties are of a different nature. M3 growth, in particular, has had a bumpy ride over the first years of EMU, buffeted by a succession of temporary shocks due to special factors. At the beginning of 1999, these were related to the increase in uncertainty occurring at the beginning of Stage Three, involving inter alia a change to the new minimum reserve requirements system, which was partly reflected in portfolio shifts into liquid instruments. An additional factor that might have played a role in the high growth of M3 in the beginning of 1999 was the existence of statistical distortions in the data. Other instances of portfolio rebalancing emerged in the autumn 2001 period of financial market instability. The persistent weakness in global stock markets drove investors away from equity and induced a reallocation of portfolios of euro area non-MFI investors towards low-risk assets. This was further enhanced by the rise of uncertainty in financial markets in the wake of the 11 September terrorist attacks. These portfolio shifts have so far been interpreted as having a temporary character. If shifts are temporary, they will likely be reversed in the future and M3 growth, ceteris paribus, should return to more moderate levels. This interpretation is partly based on the evidence that long-run money demand in the euro area remains stable, as confirmed by extensive studies based on euro-area-wide data, including recent ones conducted in the context of the review of the strategy. As already mentioned above, after a 4-year period which allowed us to accumulate some experience, the ECB decided to conduct an evaluation of its monetary policy strategy whose outcome was announced on 8 May. An important part of the review was to come to an assessment of the experience with the implementation of the strategy in the first years of EMU. The evidence accumulated led the Governing Council to conclude that the experience with the two-pillar strategy has been successful. More specifically, the Council noted that the strategy, in particular the quantitative definition of price stability, had been very effective in anchoring market expectations. The direct and indirect measures of expected inflation in the euro area have ","['monetary', 'keynesian', 'macroeconomic', 'economics', 'banking']","['monetary theorists', 'monetary analyses', 'monetary policy', 'monetary economics', 'designing monetary']","['designing monetary policy', 'analysis monetary policy', 'hold monetary theorists', 'professor monetary economics', 'monetary policy making']"
1307,r040220a_ECB,euro area,2004-02-20,Challenges for central banks in an enlarged European Union and euro area,gugerell,0,"Let me first express my pleasure to be here with you this afternoon and thank the European Community Studies Association (ECSA) and the Oesterreichische Nationalbank for their invitation. The OeNB has been particularly active in discussing issues related to enlargement and this has helped us a lot in better understanding this process of change. The challenges are effectively numerous and extremely diverse, as your programme shows. Broadly speaking, there are three lines of divide between the multiple issues we will face. Firstly, one may make a distinction between the challenges that we will face during the period prior to the adoption of the euro by acceding Member States, and the challenges that we will face afterwards. For instance, the question of the choice of a convergence path, or the operation of the ERM-II, are challenges for the period immediately after acceding countries join the EU. The question of the definition of the monetary policy strategy of the ECB after enlargement, which I understand you will be discussing tomorrow morning, has obviously little immediate implication. 2. A second line of divide separates issues of a macro-economic nature, issues of a micro-economic nature, and issues of an institutional nature. I have just listed two from the first category. Issues of a micro-economic nature include the questions related to European financial integration, to which I will come back. And there are also challenges of an institutional nature, for instance related to the internal organisation of the Eurosystem. 3. Finally, a third distinction has to be made between the issues, which are urgent and those, which are less urgent. This does not necessarily recoup exactly the question of which challenges apply before or after the introduction of the euro, because one needs to take into account lead times. To take but one example, market infrastructure for payment or clearing and settlement systems is not something that can be developed in a matter of weeks. Even though new EU Member States will not adopt the euro for a few years, the development of their market infrastructure is nonetheless an urgent challenge. Monetary policy changes: The biggest change is giving up monetary policy as a major instrument in the national economic context. This change concerns all policy makers, not only the Central Banks. Setting up a dialogue with policy makers and the public on economic conditions and policy in a European framework, on requirements for a sound fiscal policy and on needs for economic reform is one of the major challenges for a Central Bank in the context of European Integration. Central Banks are more exposed to international discussions, therefore their perspective can be a valuable basis for advice. Institutional Challenges: Acceding Countries Central Banks will become members of the European System of Central Banks and have access to most of the meetings and documentation of the ECB. Once adopting the euro they will participate in the decision making on monetary policy and all the other decisions in the Eurosystem. The challenges will be to communicate, to share information and to coordinate decision making in an effective and efficient way. My personal experience - working for a National Central Bank of a rather young member of the European Union and working for the European Central Bank is a very positive and encouraging for the new member of the System. EU-integration is a challenge but also an enrichment in our tasks and perspectives. Financial stability: Financial stability is a complex task. Prudential supervision, crisis prevention, ensuring the functioning of financial market infrastructure like payments and securities settlement systems will pose challenges to central banks also in the future. I would like to focus in particular on one issue that I believe is a prerequisite that enlargement generates all the benefits that are expected from it. That is a rapid increase in the level of financial development of the acceding countries, by the means of effective integration in the EU financial market. In my categorisation I would consider financial development and integration a challenge that is urgent because of the long lead time to success, it is an issue of rather microeconomic nature, but with macroeconomic consequences and action should be intensified before entering EMU. Historically, the functions that central banks have performed can be grouped under three broad headings. The first is the definition and implementation of monetary policy. The second is a contribution to the maintenance of financial stability, understood in a broad sense. The third is a contribution to the organisation and the smooth functioning of the financial system, with a view to enhancing its effectiveness. These three mandates are spelt out more or less explicitly in various jurisdictions, but I believe that they encompass quite accurately the range of central bank activities. The Bank of England is one example of a central bank where these three functions have been made particularly explicit, under the heading of its so-called three ""core purposes"". The third, in particular, reads as such: ""The Bank wants a financial system that offers opportunities for firms of all sizes to have access to capital on terms that give adequate protection to investors"". In the case of the Eurosystem, this third core purpose is perhaps not spelt out so explicitly, but it is implicit nonetheless. Our Statute, for instance, requires that, without prejudice to the objective of financial stability, we support the general economic policies of the Community, with a view to contributing to its objectives, in particular the promotion of economic and social progress. Our Statute also requires that we should act in accordance with the principle of an open market economy with free competition, favouring an efficient allocation of resources. There exists quite a long list of actions that we have taken that can be interpreted in the context of what I have referred to, using the Bank of England wording, as the central bank's third core purpose. Typically, the financial system in one currency area is perfectly integrated, which means in particular that there is no asymmetry between firms from different regions in their access to capital. In an integrated market the ""law of one price"" applies, meaning that services of a similar nature can be acquired for the same price, irrespective of the location where they are offered. The level of financial development of current EU Member States is already somewhat heterogeneous, and financial integration is far from complete. But the issue will be compounded with the arrival of new Member States. Their level of financial development - measured by the degree of financial indermediation - is much lower. The European Commission recently assessed that all ten acceding countries have established a functioning market economy. Judging on the basis of the transition indicators developed by the EBRD, institutional reform needs nonetheless to be pursued further in most Central and Eastern European countries, in particular as regards the environment in which financial institutions operate. If one takes the size of the banking sector as an indicator of financial development, there exists a fairly large discrepancy between the ratio of banking assets to GDP in acceding countries, where it is almost everywhere below 100%, and the same ratio in the euro area, which is around two and a half times higher. The overall picture is similar if one considers instead the ratio of stock market capitalisation to GDP, although with fairly large discrepancies between individual cases. All in all, financial assets of new member countries, expressed in relation to GDP, are roughly one third of the corresponding amount in the euro area. Financial development in these countries is best supported by an increasing financial integration into the financial market of the EU. The advantages of financial integration are obvious as it leads to: A pooling of liquidity, A reduction in transaction costs, Broader access to financial instruments and An increase in efficiency at the allocation of resources. Effective integration into the EU financial system, by potentially raising the level of financial development of new member countries, can have an immediate and direct positive net impact on their macro-economic growth potential. In other terms, financial integration can be a major contribution to the so-called catching up process. Acceding countries' financial systems are characterised by a high degree of foreign involvement, in particular through ownership of banks. This is one among many channels whereby financial integration is supported. There exist other channels: over the past years the EIB has issued bonds in Czech Koruna, Hungarian Forint and Polish Zloty, and has therefore contributed to the development of the framework for the bond markets in these countries. Financial integration, however, does not only serve the purpose of further market development, but also constitutes the basis for efficiently and effectively carrying out the main tasks of a central bank. In the view of the ECB financial integration is important for monetary policy for three reasons: Less integrated financial markets provide less information for monetary policy decisions. Financial market indicators are less reliable in less integrated markets as prices are distorted, The implementation of monetary policy in integrated markets is more effective as interest rate signals immediately translate into market reactions, Integration of financial infrastructure such as payment systems or security settlement systems makes transactions in a currency area quicker, cheaper and more secure. This is the main motivation for the ECB's activities to promote further financial integration in the euro area, but also in the EU and the acceding countries. Let me conclude by summarising: The role and functions of central banks are important and will be important in the future. However, a new and changing environment requires new concepts and innovation in the field of central banking. EU and euro area enlargement has to be well managed by timely preparation by the central banks concerned. This involves addressing macroeconomic, microeconomic and institutional challenges, taking into account the lead times it takes to successfully conclude these preparations. Financial development in acceding countries can be fostered by promoting financial integration. This is, however, an issue which is at least of the same importance to current member states as for future member states of the EU. The ECB attaches great importance to further financial integration and engages in several respective activities in close co-operation with the private market. The list of challenges is long and a lot of work lies in front of us. Quoting Johann Wolfgang von Goethe one has to acknowledge that ""Progress has never followed a straight ascending line, but a spiral with rhythms of progress and retrogression, of evolution and dissolution."" I am confident, however, that on the basis of our experience and given the high expertise concentrated in central banks future challenges are recognised in time, analysed accordingly and good progress is made in developing a well functioning system of European central banks in the future.","['macroeconomic', 'eurosystem', 'eu', 'euro', 'ecb']","['eurosystem challenges', 'introduction euro', 'euro acceding', 'adopting euro', 'policy european']","['euro area enlargement', 'policy decisions eurosystem', 'policy european framework', 'strategy ecb enlargement', 'decisions eurosystem challenges']"
1311,r040305a_ECB,euro area,2004-03-05,Paris Seminar on the EU accession process: Concluding remarks,trichet,1,"Distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, To conclude this seminar, let me say what a great pleasure it has been for me to be here with you yesterday and today. This seminar has brought together governors, vice-governors and high-level representatives of the 12 accession country central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the 15 national central banks of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB), as well as representatives of the Irish Presidency and the European Commission. Today's discussions have, in my view, clearly shown how much progress we have already made in exploring many of the key issues that will shape successful monetary cooperation and integration in an enlarged European Union (EU). They also illustrate how much common ground we share on central banking matters here in Europe. Obviously, this is the result of our regular and increasingly close contact over half a decade. And I believe that this permanent dialogue is a very valuable asset for future interaction, particularly in an enlarged ESCB. Listening to today's presentations and statements, it struck me how many interlinkages there are between, on the one hand, the policy issues, and on the other, the practical and operational aspects. It is important, and it will always be important, to understand the implementation issues, and to anticipate questions that may arise in day-to-day practice. Our discussion in the first session, entitled ""Monetary and exchange rate policies and the practical functioning of ERM II"", illustrated that this is particularly important in the case of ERM II, as our practical and operational experience with ERM II is still somewhat limited and our initial experience from ""ERM I"", although useful, is not always wholly relevant. Our discussions highlighted both that ERM II is a useful framework to help Member States participating in the mechanism in their efforts to adopt the euro and, also, that participation in ERM II is only one element of the overall policy framework. Participation in ERM II must be complemented by other elements of this overall policy framework. As we stated in the Policy position of the Governing Council of the ECB on exchange rate issues relating to the acceding countries (published on 18 December 2003), to ensure a smooth participation in ERM II it would be necessary that major policy adjustments - for example with regard to price liberalisation and fiscal policy - are undertaken prior to participation in the mechanism, and that a credible fiscal consolidation path is being followed. Drawing lessons from one's own experience and from that of others was clearly another of today's seminar. Obviously, this is easier said than done. But if a task is difficult, it means that we should simply work harder at it. Respecting rules is particularly important in the EU institutional framework. Fiscal rules in the European Union are a clear case in point, as the discussion in our second session today entitled ""Budgetary discipline in the context of the Stability and Growth Pact"" has clearly shown. Fiscal performance has been rather weak recently in some of the acceding countries. In this context, the multilateral surveillance procedures within the EU framework, and in particular the Stability and Growth Pact, will play a key role in enhancing budgetary discipline. In this area, let me reiterate that the Governing Council of the ECB shares the concerns of the European Commission regarding the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council in November last year. The Commission is the guardian of the Treaty and the ECB respects the Commission's decision to seek legal clarity. Furthermore, we do not see a need to change the Treaty and, in our view, the Stability and Growth Pact in its current form is appropriate. We are in agreement with the Commission that the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact could be further improved, in particular in terms of the analysis of structural imbalances and the strengthening of incentives for sound fiscal policies during good economic times. Clarity and enforceability of the fiscal framework should be enhanced. What holds true for rules in general can also be applied to standards and regulations (which are specific forms of rules). Our discussion in the last session, entitled ""Issues related to financial standards, accounting regulations and corporate governance"", has made this crystal clear with regard to standards and regulations in the financial and corporate sector. Given the extent of globalisation in today's world, the need for a sound framework for the conduct of business and for appropriate supervision, also in cross-border terms, has never been more pressing. If I can draw just one general conclusion from all of our discussions today, it is the importance of . Although the forthcoming accession is undoubtedly a major historic achievement, we must continue to thoroughly for integration in the future in order to get the timing of policy actions right. So where do we go from here? Looking ahead over the remainder of 2004 and beyond, there are clearly challenges for which we need to continue to prepare. Challenges and opportunities for all countries represented here today. Let me conclude by warmly thanking Governor Noyer and the staff of the Banque de France for their excellent preparation of this seminar. I am sure I speak for all participants when I say that we have appreciated your very warm hospitality and splendid organisation both yesterday evening and today. In the name of all fellow members of the Governing Council of the ECB, I would also like to thank all participants, and in particular our colleagues from the accession countries, for coming to Paris to discuss a broad set of issues that are vital to both the future of monetary integration in Europe and the financial stability of our continent. As I said yesterday evening, this seminar in Paris is the last one in the current configuration. However, there will be other seminars and opportunities for close dialogue with central banks from those countries still negotiating EU membership, and with central banks from countries that may become accession countries in the future.

1324,r040505a_ECB,euro area,2004-05-05,The current state of the EU banking sector,trichet,1,"It is both a pleasure and an honour to be invited to speak here today at the Annual Congress of German Savings Banks. Being in front of such a distinguished audience of representatives of the financial community, I would like to present some views on the current state of play in the European banking sector. I will in particular analyse the factors that have contributed to its resilience over recent years. Since 2000, EU banks have been confronted by an extraordinary combination of adverse financial market shocks against the backdrop of a slow-down in the economy. Some commentators have even been surprised by the few banking problems in the euro area during this period, given that earlier episodes of slow growth often went hand in hand with severe problems in the sector. For central banks and banking supervisors, the resilience of the EU banking sector is, of course, very good news. At the same time, it raises a number of questions.What is now so different compared with the stressful periods that banks experienced in the past and what factors have contributed to this resilience? But before addressing these issues, let me start by briefly recalling how challenging the environment has actually been for EU banks over recent years. Without a doubt, the most momentous technical and strategic challenge was the , now more than five years ago. The very smooth transition that followed the adoption of the euro almost makes us forget the uncertainties, and sometimes even concerns, expressed before 1999 about the structural implications the euro might have on the euro area banking sector. The second challenge faced by banks in recent years was that not long after the banking sector had begun to adjust to operating with a new currency - including all of the efforts that this entailed - an followed in quick succession. After an almost uninterrupted stock market boom since 1995, a severe stock market correction set in in March 2000 and investors faced three consecutive years of negative returns. Investor confidence was also badly shaken by unprecedented episodes of serious corporate malfeasance. Although most of the main abuses took place abroad, Europe also had its fair share. Over time, we have observed that banks have increasingly diversified into securities trading, investment banking and asset management. Although much was expected from this diversification strategy, the market correction was a reminder that fee income generated by these businesses also carries risks. Looking back, I think we can also say that some banks entered the businesses too late and at too high a price. The corporate scandals that coincided with the market downturn raised further questions about certain bank practices and Chinese walls did not always prove to be as impermeable as might have been expected. In my list of stressful events, I should also mention the re-emergence of and the fall-out from the in the United States. Country risk re-emerged as Turkey and Argentina were caught up in currency and banking crises. Although the crises had only limited economic effects on the EU banking sector as a whole, some banks incurred substantial losses. As to the tragic events in the United States, they had an immediate effect on the working of financial infrastructures and markets, but this was tackled quickly and efficiently by the competent authorities, including those here in Europe. In the medium term, however, the attacks shook investor and consumer confidence further. The third challenge, to conclude my brief overview, is that this extraordinary set of events took place at the same time that the from the second half of 2000 onwards. As debt ratios in the corporate sector had risen significantly through the years of the stock market boom, signs of financial distress quickly surfaced as firms found that profits were not matching earlier expectations. But in spite of the circumstances that I describe here, . The return on equity of EU banks peaked at 12% in 2000. The sector's profitability subsequently declined for two consecutive years, reaching 8.6% in 2002. Increased loan-loss provisions for corporate loans, reduced commissions and trading income from capital market-related business were mainly behind this fall. Although the decline was substantial, overall profitability levels continued to be well above those recorded in the second half of the 1990s. In the course of 2003 profitability picked up again. Banks' solvency levels remained relatively unaffected by the adverse events. Thanks to these adequate financial buffers, banks were able to withstand the shocks in their operating environment. The aggregated total regulatory capital ratio continued to hover around 12% throughout the period after 2000, which is well above the required minimum ratio of 8% for individual institutions. Although the overall picture was rather comforting, I have to qualify this somewhat by saying that some individual institutions indeed experienced serious difficulties. Often this was because of problem loans in certain sectors, such as real estate, or because of the disappointing results in market-based activities. In some instances, the intervention of public authorities or private banks was required to prevent banks from failing. Ladies and gentlemen, I now come to the essence of my question, namely the factors that have accounted for the EU banking sector's resilience over recent years. I am of the opinion that the benign combination of cyclical and structural factors contributed to this resilience. Let me start with the . Although the economy started to slow down in 2000, it was preceded by a period of booming financial markets and strong growth. This expansive period helped banks to build up financial buffers sufficient to withstand the subsequent downturn. Although the economic conditions were weak for a long period of time, the slowdown itself was relatively mild. Macro-economic instability, which so often coincides with a banking crisis, was absent in the EU in the period from 2000 onwards. It is my conviction that the contributed significantly to this benign environment. First, by abolishing exchange rates between the former euro area currencies, exchange rate turbulence was avoided. Second, the adoption of a common policy framework based on price stability, fiscal discipline and the implementation of structural reforms contributed favourably. The low inflation and interest rate environment, as well as sustained real estate prices, supported some lines of banks' business. The retail business fared well and mortgage lending was dynamic in the face of declining financing costs and increasing house values. This helped to counteract weakened corporate lending and the market-related activities of banks. I now come to the that contribute to the EU banking sector's resilience. There I see that , as well as developments in financial markets, have paid off. As a central banker, I would like to start with the role played by the authorities. Over recent years, the for banks has been greatly reinforced. Here we should duly recognise the progress made under the influence of the extensive guidance developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. At the EU level there have also been great achievements and crucial building blocks of a common sound regulatory regime have been agreed upon. Here I am referring to the rules on access to the banking business, capital requirements, large exposures and group-wide supervision. Another positive development I see is the , who, as a result, are able to address the challenges of a banking business that is increasingly performed across borders. In this context I have to stress the valuable work that is being undertaken by the ESCB's Banking Supervision Committee. The committee, which consists of EU national central banks and banking supervisors, performs extensive work in the area of financial stability monitoring. It does this by looking both at cyclical and structural developments that might affect the EU banking sector's resilience. I equally want to stress the efforts made by banks. has been growing in importance and is becoming more integrated in banks' overall decision-making. Thanks to innovation in financial markets and advances in the quantification of risk, risk management practices have been significantly improved. Although concerns have been voiced about the spectacular growth in credit derivatives, they also allow banks to better shape their risk profile. Risk models which are increasingly being used to gauge credit and operational risk allow for an empirical underpinning of risk management. Through joint projects such as the one being undertaken by federations of savings banks to develop risk know-how and management systems, advanced risk management tools have also become available to smaller institutions. Outsourcing and centralisation in the field of individual banks' payment and settlement systems is another example of such joint projects which are being undertaken in a number of EU countries at the same time. The profitability pressures I described earlier have not led banks into immobility; in fact they have been quite . Lending terms have been tightened and more risk-based pricing strategies applied. In addition, non-core assets have been shed and the number of branches and employees reduced. This is particularly evident in the national banking systems that were in need of further substantial restructuring. I want to conclude my overview by pointing to the . Again, the single currency has been a beneficial factor. This is most clearly illustrated by the unsecured money market. A very well integrated money market supported by TARGET, the area-wide wholesale payment system, now allows liquidity to be quickly channelled from areas of the European banking sector that show surpluses to areas that suffer shortages. This has contributed to a more robust banking system. The emergence of a number of highly liquid euro-denominated exchange contracts has also facilitated banks' risk management. Ladies and gentlemen, let me briefly conclude. I have discussed how, under the challenging conditions of the past few years, the EU banking sector has remained robust thanks to a benign combination of cyclical and structural factors. Nevertheless, a number of challenges remain both for banks and authorities, in particular, in the structural domain. Several EU countries are still faced with excess capacity in their banking systems that will have to be further reduced over time. Likewise, cross-border consolidation might accelerate as mergers and acquisitions pick up again following improved market conditions. Regarding regulation and supervision there is the new committee structure that is currently being set up at the EU level to improve rule-making and implementation; its agenda is demanding and challenging. Other important challenges that lie ahead are the introduction of the New Capital Accord and the International Accounting Standards, whose potential structural effects on the EU banking sector are still uncertain. Finally, another significant change for the EU banking sector, as I mentioned, is the recent entry of the new Member States into the EU. However, as these countries' banking systems are, to a large extent, already integrated in the EU banking system, this should be favourable for a smooth transition.

1388,r050114a_ECB,euro area,2005-01-14,The euro ; successes and challenges,trichet,1,"Ladies and gentlemen, It is a pleasure to be here today to share with you some thoughts on the successes and challenges of the euro. European integration has moved steadily forward over the past decades, witnessing considerable success and triggering fundamental change. The euro, which is probably the most visible and tangible symbol of this integration process, is this year entering its seventh year, with a single currency and a single monetary policy for more than 300 million citizens. All in all, the European Monetary Union has managed very well in not always so easy conditions, despite some critiques, doubts and fears that were voiced earlier on. Of course, the euro also has brought about significant challenges. I would today like to discuss in more detail what I see as the main successes and challenges of the euro. I would also like to reflect on the need to accept change and reform in order to move forward. Let me start with the successes to date. The first success I would like to stress is a technical success which enabled a smooth implementation of the single monetary policy from day one, namely the in early January 1999. Thanks to careful technical preparations of connecting national payment systems, smooth interbank transactions with small spreads were made possible. Looking at European more in general, while there has been a continued process of integration over the last decades, the arrival of the euro certainly accelerated this process by removing barriers to cross-border trading and creating more scope for risk sharing and diversification. In particular, the depth and breadth of financial markets have increased as a consequence of the elimination of exchange rate risk and the rapid growth of new market segments, such as the corporate bond market, allowing more investors to access the various financial markets in the euro area. This in turn has led to more efficient financial markets which have contributed to economic growth. stands out as a major milestone in European monetary history It was also a particularly successful event in terms of logistics. Changing the currency for more than 300 million people in a few weeks was truly daunting. The efficiency and enthusiasm with which this changeover took place was exemplary. This success can be attributed to the quality of the preparations made by all players involved and at all levels, not to mention the enthusiastic reception of the general public. In fact, in all countries, the changeover period was much swifter that anticipated. Sharing a single currency implies a need of a feeling of community and trust among all the users of the currency. After all, a currency is backed by the mutual trust placed in it by its users. The relative ease with which euro cash was introduced and accepted by people shows that there may be stronger feelings of community in Europe than many would have thought. Third, another important, but sometimes grossly underestimated success of the euro relates to the towards the best performers in terms of credibility and low interest rates. The stability oriented macroeconomic policy framework, focusing on price stability and sound fiscal policies, has resulted in significantly reduced financing costs in most countries. Today, the European economy benefits from benchmark long-term market interest rates well below 4%, a level which most issuers have never seen in the last fifty years. The reduction in risk premia and the stabilisation in inflation expectations at low levels is a major achievement which must be maintained by today's and future economic policy making. Fourth, a related success of the euro has been an improved For those who experienced the many episodes of exchange and interest rate volatility between the 1970s and the mid-1990s, it is clear that, without the single currency, events in recent years such as the financial crisis of autumn 1998, the turbulence that followed the September 11 terrorist attacks or the past swings in global exchange markets would have triggered major turbulences in European countries. Last but not least, I would like to mention which has preserved price stability and credibility in a transparent manner. With a clearly defined mandate to pursue price stability in the Treaty and a strong focus on independence, the European Central Bank, together with the participating national central banks, has implemented the single monetary policy in the euro area since 1999. As you know, the ECB defines price stability as inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Looking back at the period since the introduction of the euro, actual inflation rates were not always in line with price stability, due to exceptional shocks such as the rise in oil prices in recent years. However, these shocks did not undermine the credibility of our promise to ensure price stability over the medium term and therefore did not derail inflation expectations. This was due to our medium-term orientation of monetary policy which is aimed at providing a stable anchor for economic agents. Indeed, the best contribution of monetary policy to economic growth is when inflation and inflation expectations are firmly anchored at price stability. One way of measuring our success in providing this long-term anchor is to study long-term market expectations for inflation. Taken all measures together, from financial markets or from survey data, the information indicates that we have been successful in stabilising inflation expectations at below 2%. But these measures also indicate that we need to remain vigilant as regards any upside risks to price stability over the medium term. The understanding of how a central bank reacts to data and indicators is crucial for the anchoring of inflation expectations and for the credibility of monetary policy. The overall success of the ECB's monetary policy also reflects, in my view, a success in terms of . As a public institution providing a public good with full independence, we are responsible and accountable to the people of Europe. Consequently, a significant part of our job is devoted to explaining and discussing our actions and our goals to the public. From the start, the Governing Council has decided to communicate its assessment of the economic situation and of the risks to price stability in a new and exceptionally transparent fashion. Monetary policy decisions are explained at the press conference which takes place immediately after the first Governing Council meeting of the month; the ECB was the first major central bank to embark on such concept of transparency, and it was then followed by other important central banks. Further explanations of our policy are presented in the ECB's Monthly Bulletin, in speeches given by members of the Governing Council and in the testimonies of the President before the European Parliament. Let me now turn to two of the most important challenges we are currently facing and which need to be addressed in order to fully reap the benefits of the euro, namely raising potential economic growth and the enlargement of the euro area. Let me start with the first challenge I want to discuss today, namely the in a sustainable manner. We all know that the growth performance of a number of euro area countries has been disappointing during the past years, both in a historical perspective and compared with other economies. This is also true since the start of the euro, despite the improved financing conditions I mentioned earlier. This reflects both international and domestic factors: The world economy is transforming rapidly, external competition has become stronger, knowledge is easily transferable and the ability to adjust to changing economic circumstances is increasingly important. Many European countries have not been adapting their economic, social and legal frameworks - set up under very different conditions - rapidly enough to face these challenges. At the same time, the age structure of Europe is getting increasingly unfavourable. In facing this challenge, the options are limited; we need to adjust our regulatory frameworks in product, labour and financial markets in a way that competitiveness and economic dynamism are maintained. Some countries in the euro area, which have done well in terms of maintaining high output and employment growth, demonstrate that such changes are possible not only outside Europe but also within. At the EU level, the Lisbon Agenda constitute the main driver in this field. It aims at enhancing the knowledge-based economy and thereby productivity, increase labour participation and foster financial integration. Recently, the report prepared by the High Level Group chaired by Wim Kok provided an assessment of the Lisbon Strategy and stated that there had been a ""disappointing delivery"" on the agreed measures. The report expressed an urgent need for renewed impetus, stronger commitment of national governments and a sharpening of the Lisbon Strategy's focus on the acceleration of employment and productivity growth. It also regards the role of benchmarking as crucial. The ECB strongly welcomes these proposals, as they are well in line with our own views. Indeed, what matters for our future success is innovation, productivity enhancement and employment growth and all measures should be directed to achieve these results. Let me further elaborate on a few areas in urgent need of reform. Most observers agree that further reforms in labour markets in many euro area countries are absolutely crucial in order to improve the quality, incentives and flexibility of labour supply. The current mix of tax and benefit systems continue to provide a disincentive to take up work or to work longer hours in many countries. Measures to make wage growth reflect more strongly regional and sectoral productivity differences would certainly be helpful. In addition, efforts by Governments to improve education and training systems to improve skills are to be supported. In product markets, substantial progress has been made during the 1990s with important effects on productivity, prices and employment. This is an encouragement to do more in terms of fully implementing the Single Market and reducing market entry barriers in national regulations which continue to hamper competition. Especially in the services sector, where most new jobs are created, sometimes excessive regulation still persists. Finally, I believe that further integration in euro area financial markets is possible, especially as regards the integration of equity markets, continued efforts to harmonise legal and regulatory frameworks, and the consolidation of the banking sector. Not only would these reforms raise potential economic growth, but they would also make the economies more flexible and thereby strengthen the resilience against shocks. This in turn would facilitate the pursuit of stability oriented macroeconomic policies. Let me now turn to a second major challenge I see, namely . The historic EU enlargement with ten countries on the 1st of May last year was only a first step in the process of economic and monetary integration of the new Member States. None of the 10 new Member States have a special status as regards the introduction of the euro, implying that they are all expected to strive to fulfil the convergence criteria and subsequently to adopt the euro. An important step in this process is to join the exchange rate mechanism ERM II, for which at least a two year membership is foreseen in order to comply with the exchange rate criterion. Although there are no formal criteria to be met for entry into ERM II, successful participation will benefit from having major policy adjustments - for example relating to fiscal consolidation and price liberalisation - undertaken before joining the mechanism. Otherwise, significant pressures on the exchange rate may arise which may jeopardise the convergence process. Having proceeded with the necessary structural adjustments, participation in ERM II can be an important means of anchoring exchange rate and inflation expectations and of promoting discipline. It can help orient macroeconomic policies to stability, while at the same time allowing for a degree of flexibility if needed, through the standard fluctuation band and the possibility of adjusting the central parity. This period can also be seen as a realistic experience of the capacity of Member States to respect the requirements of the Monetary Union, in which the exchange rate will no longer be available in order to adjust to changing economic conditions. Before adopting the euro, all convergence criteria, relating not only to exchange rate developments but also to inflation, public deficit and debt, and long-term interest rates, as well as legal convergence, will need to be achieved in a sustainable manner. Only when all the criteria are met on a sustainable basis, will a country be eligible for adopting the euro. As it is an irreversible decision, joining the euro area is a very important step requiring careful preparation. Every country will be assessed on its own merits and its own particular situation. Whether this process will go swiftly or be more prolonged depends largely on countries' starting position, remaining needs for structural change and integration, and how successful they are in maintaining sound economic policies. While the criteria for sound and sustainable macroeconomic policies are crucial for the well functioning of the Monetary Union, they also make good economic sense for individual countries, both before and after joining the euro area. Ultimately, I am convinced that EU and euro area enlargement will contribute positively to economic growth and welfare in the whole EU. Ladies and gentlemen, in conclusion, let me once again stress my firm belief that the Economic and Monetary Union has seen a number of successes in a very short period of time: the introduction a new currency for more than 300 million Europeans, the maintenance of price stability and low market interest rates and the promotion of financial integration. These successes, which are indispensable conditions for sustainable economic growth and employment, needs however to be complemented by further progress in other parts of the economy. I am referring in particular to the implementation of structural reform. In order to reap the full benefits of the EMU and to cope with the global competitive pressures, a truly dynamic economic environment will need to be put firmly in place. These issues have been identified and solutions have been drawn up, in particular in the Lisbon agenda. Now, the challenge is to implement these commitments. In this endeavour, the new Member States of the EU will undoubtedly make constructive contributions, benefiting from their recent experiences in restructuring their economies to the EU framework. To some extent, all changes and new challenges impose feelings of fear and hesitation - most likely due to the simple fact that most human beings fear the unknown. We know what we got but we do not know what we will get, and this inhibits our actions. Such hesitation is natural but the success of the euro itself shows that a combination of insights, leadership, technical capacity and preparation can be channelled into a general enthusiasm to succeed and to rise to the challenge. While the euro is still a young currency, it draws on the cumulated wisdom of its legacy currencies. This combination of youth and experience is unique.

1417,r050531b_ECB,euro area,2005-05-31,Press briefing on the ECB Financial Stability Review – June 2005,main,0,"Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to this press briefing on the publication of the ECB's June 2005 Financial Stability Review. Let me start by saying that in publishing this Financial Stability Review, the second of its kind, the European Central Bank (ECB) is enhancing the way in which it addresses its financial stability mandate by issuing a public report on a semi-annual basis. Under Article 105 (5), the Treaty establishing the European Union assigned to the Eurosystem the task of contributing "" "". In this vein, the issuing of this review, which represents the common view of the Governing Council of the ECB, and is now published half-yearly in June and December, is to promote awareness in the financial industry and among the public at large of issues that are relevant for preserving and enhancing the stability of the euro area financial system. By providing an overview of sources of risk and vulnerability to financial stability, the review also seeks to help preventing financial tensions. Many of the national central banks that make up the Eurosystem are also addressing their own financial stability mandates by periodically issuing public reports on the functioning of, and sources of risk facing, their own financial systems. By providing a unique pan-euro area perspective on financial stability issues, the ECB Review aims at complementing the analyses contained within these reports. As I have said on the occasion of the publication of the ECB's first Financial Stability Review last December, central banks have a strong and natural interest in the safeguarding of financial stability. This is in particular because financial institutions, notably banks, are issuers of by far the largest component of the money stock. It is equally because a stable financial system is needed for an effective transmission of monetary policy and for the smooth operation of payment systems. A robust financial system is therefore needed to ensure that the single monetary policy can deliver on the primary objective of maintaining price stability in the euro area. Finally, but not least, the health of the financial system is inextricably intertwined with the performance of the economy and its resilience to shocks. These are the reasons why the ECB and the Eurosystem have an important stake in financial stability in the euro area. Complex to define, financial stability is not only of the essence in avoiding financial crises but also in paving the way for the best financial environment in normal times. It is a condition where the financial system is capable of performing well in normal times all of its normal tasks and where it is expected to do so for the foreseeable future. From this viewpoint, financial system stability requires that the principal components of the system - i.e. financial institutions, markets and infrastructures - are jointly capable of absorbing smoothly a full array of adverse disturbances. It requires that the financial system is facilitating an efficient reallocation of financial resources from savers to investors, that financial risk is being assessed and priced accurately and that risks are being efficiently managed. Financial stability also has an important forward-looking dimension. For instance, inefficiencies in the allocation of capital or shortcomings in the pricing of risk can, by laying the foundations for future vulnerabilities, compromise future financial system stability and therefore economic stability. Three steps are needed to produce a comprehensive picture of the stability of the financial system. The first entails forming an assessment of the individual and collective robustness of the institutions, markets and infrastructures that make up the financial system. The second involves an identification of the main sources of risk and vulnerability that could pose challenges for financial system stability in the future. The third and final step is an appraisal of the ability of the financial system to cope with crisis, should these risks materialise. The overall assessment will determine whether remedial action is needed. It is important to bear in mind financial stability analysis is very different from the analysis that underpins our monetary policy assessment. Financial stability analysis has a focus on calling attention to potential sources of risk and vulnerability to the functioning of the financial system and it does not aim at identifying the main - or most likely - future scenario for the euro area economy. It neither aims at identifying the full balance of risks surrounding this main scenario as is the principal focus in the monetary policy assessment and decision-making process. Rather it entails the highlighting of potential and plausible sources of negative events, even if these are remote and very unlikely. As was the case with the preparation of the December 2004 Financial Stability Review, the analysis contained in this review was prepared with the close involvement of, and contribution by, the Banking Supervision Committee (BSC). The BSC is a forum for cooperation among the national central banks and supervisory authorities of the EU and the ECB. The collaboration with the BSC has meant that the review draws upon a very broad knowledge-base and the analysis contained within it blends together the macro perspectives of central bankers with the micro perspectives of supervisors. Over the past seven years the driving force behind the development of financial stability analysis at the ECB, both at the conceptual and practical level, has been Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa. As you are aware, today is also Mr. Padoa-Schioppa's last working day at the ECB. I would therefore like to take this opportunity to express in the name of the ECB my deep gratitude for the work he has undertaken as a founding member of the Executive Board and of the Governing Council, as well as for the inspiration he has provided for the work of many of the committees and working groups that together form the flesh and blood of the Eurosystem. In this vein, the financial stability analysis, in particular, is an area that, I am sure, will continue to be shaped by the guidance provided by Mr Padoa-Schioppa. Let me now give the floor to Mr Padoa-Schioppa, who will present to you the main findings of the analysis in the June Financial Stability Review.","['euro', 'eurosystem', 'ecb', 'banking', 'eu']","['stability euro', 'ecb eurosystem', 'ecb financial', 'eu ecb', 'bank ecb']","['ecb financial stability', 'financial stability euro', 'ecb eurosystem important', 'eurosystem addressing financial', 'reasons ecb eurosystem']"
1468,r051216a_ECB,euro area,2005-12-16,European financial integration,trichet,1,"Ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to speak to you today on the occasion of the 10th Symposium on Finance, Banking, and Insurance. I would like to congratulate the organisers for arranging this internationally esteemed conference at the University of Karlsruhe. Karlsruhe, the former residence of the Dukes of Baden, is not only beautifully located between the Rhine and the Black Forest, it is also situated right in the middle of Europe. And Europe is at the heart of the topic that I will discuss in my speech today. This symposium traditionally aims to strengthen the links between theory and practice, addressing the latest developments in a wide range of finance issues. This is the second factor underlying my choice of topic. Today, I will talk about European financial integration. This subject is of interest to market participants, policy-makers and academics alike, and is of the utmost interest to the European Central Bank (ECB). In fact, the Governing Council of the ECB has formulated the mission of the Eurosystem (comprising the ECB and the euro area national central banks) as follows: ""We in the Eurosystem have as our primary objective the maintenance of price stability for the common good. Acting also as a leading financial authority, we aim to safeguard financial stability and promote European financial integration."" I will structure my remarks as follows. First, I will explain the link between financial integration and monetary policy and financial stability. I will then present the current state of financial integration in the euro area based on the indicators of financial integration recently published by the ECB. Finally, I will mention some specific activities by which the Eurosystem contributes to fostering financial integration, and I will highlight some topical EU policy issues in the field of European financial integration. In accordance with the tasks referred to in the Eurosystem's mission statement, I will first discuss the link between financial integration and monetary policy, before addressing the relationship between financial integration and financial stability. In line with good academic practice, I will start with a definition. The ECB defines financial integration as follows: we consider the market for a given set of financial instruments or services to be fully integrated when all potential market participants in such market (i) are subject to a single set of rules when they decide to deal with those financial instruments or services, (ii) have equal access to this set of financial instruments or services, and (iii) are treated equally when they operate in the market. While this definition describes a state of full, or perfect, integration, we know that in practice we are faced with a process. The two actors striving to foster financial integration are the market participants and the relevant public authorities. More specifically, the Eurosystem is of the view that financial integration first and foremost is a market-driven process. In addition to this, we believe that it is a basic task of the relevant public authorities to create a framework that is conducive to fostering financial integration. If the opportunities this creates are exploited by market forces, true financial integration will have been achieved. Financial integration affects the three major components of the financial system, namely the financial markets, the related market infrastructures, and the financial institutions. In fact, financial integration affects these components simultaneously and alters their functioning and interaction. Financial integration is therefore directly relevant for the ECB's tasks. With regard to the relationship between financial integration and monetary policy, first, a well-integrated financial system is essential for the implementation of our monetary policy as it enhances the smooth and effective transmission of monetary policy impulses throughout the euro area, which is the process through which monetary policy decisions affect the price level in particular and the economy in general. In fact, if the financial system were not fully integrated, there is a possibility that the single monetary policy decisions would sometimes be channelled to countries in a not completely uniform manner. The degree of financial integration is therefore important in determining the effectiveness of this transmission: the higher the degree of financial integration, the more effectively this transmission will work in practice. Second, it is generally accepted that financial integration is a key factor in the development and modernisation of the financial system, which, in turn, leads to a more efficient allocation of capital and an increased potential for economic growth. The recently renewed Lisbon programme has two main goals: to strengthen growth and increase employment in Europe. The ECB fully supports this programme. The structural reforms that are necessary in this respect, such as improving the flexibility and adaptability of labour markets and increasing competition in the markets for goods and services, will also enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy in maintaining price stability and minimise output volatility in response to adverse price shocks. The need to proceed with structural reforms fully applies to European financial integration. Financial markets that are not yet fully integrated have a potential to increase economic growth which must be exploited. For example, a study estimates the potential resulting from the integration of European bond and equity markets in terms of additional GDP growth at around 1% over a ten-year period, or approximately EUR 100 billion. Moreover, the 311 million people in the euro area, or, more generally, the 459 million citizens of the European Union, expect Europe to deliver such economic benefits. As a central banker, I am very conscious of the fact that the implementation of structural reforms which increase the economic potential of the euro area also facilitates the conduct of monetary policy. To summarise, enhanced European financial integration increases the potential for greater and more sustained non-inflationary economic growth. I now turn to the links between financial integration and financial stability. The task of contributing to the safeguarding of financial stability is provided for in the Treaty establishing the European Community. The ECB provides the outcome of its monitoring of euro area-wide financial stability in its Financial Stability Review that is made available to the public. Our latest report was published just one week ago. Let me first make some general remarks about the task to assess the stability of the financial system. Although, like it is the case for monetary policy assessment, there is not yet a widely accepted, rigorous framework that summarises developments in financial stability in a single quantitative measure, many of the financial stability assessments that are undertaken by a growing number of central banks around the world are based on a broad and forward-looking notion of financial stability. Financial stability is often seen from the perspective of the avoidance of financial crises, but it has a larger dimension. Financial system stability requires the financial system's principal components - financial markets, the related market infrastructures, and financial institutions - to be jointly capable of absorbing adverse disturbances. It also requires that the financial system is facilitating a smooth and efficient reallocation of financial resources from savers to investors, that financial risk is being assessed and priced accurately and that risks are being efficiently managed. Financial stability has an important forward-looking dimension: inefficiencies in the reallocation of capital or shortcomings in the pricing of risk can, by laying the foundations for future vulnerabilities, compromise future financial system stability and, therefore, economic stability. A lack of stability can be directly related to inefficiencies that may arise from a non-integrated financial system. Being aware of the links between financial integration and financial stability is therefore essential. The links between financial integration and financial stability are twofold. On the one hand, more integrated financial markets offer better opportunities for financing and risk diversification, and thus help to improve the capacity of economies to absorb shocks. Cross-border banking broadens and deepens financial markets and increases liquidity and risk sharing. As the pool of available assets for investment is broadened, potentially enhancing the heterogeneity of financial institutions' portfolios, the ensuing wider spread of portfolio-related risks should reinforce the resilience and shock-absorption capacity of financial intermediaries, thus improving the soundness and robustness of an integrated financial system. On the other hand, as intermediaries benefit from the greater availability of assets, a parallel convergence of the individual portfolios may result. We therefore need a good degree of understanding of the effects of cross-border linkages in an increasingly integrated financial system. To summarise, financial integration will progressively strengthen the stability of the financial system over time. But the structural transformation of the financial system through enhanced financial integration, including the creation of intensified cross-border financial links, requires that we closely monitor the financial integration process. I would finally like to emphasise that financial integration is relevant to both monetary policy and financial stability. This brings me neatly to the second part of my speech, namely to illustrate the current state and the evolution of financial integration in the euro area. In discussions on this topic, the arguments are often of a qualitative nature, stating the general need for enhancing financial integration in view of the related benefits. Notwithstanding this, quantitative measures offer the advantage of being able to assess both the current level of financial integration as well as its evolution over time, i.e. whether integration is progressing, stable, or even regressive. The ECB has therefore sought to devise a way to capture, in quantitative terms, the state of financial integration in the euro area. About two months ago, for the first time, the ECB published a set of indicators regarding the state of integration of euro area financial and banking markets. With the accompanying explanatory report, which will be published on an annual basis, the ECB aims to measure and monitor financial integration in the euro area over time. Before turning to the actual assessment of the state of financial integration, let me briefly mention a few conceptual issues. First, checking the validity of the law of one price is a natural basis for the development of quantitative measures of financial integration. The law of one price states that if assets have identical risks and returns, they should be priced identically regardless of where they are transacted. The law of one price is an implication of our definition of financial integration, which I mentioned earlier. And, in fact, most of our integration measures explicitly depend on it. Still, there are cases where the law of one price is not directly applicable. For instance, an asset may not be allowed to be listed on another region's exchange. While the law of one price has little to say about this case, we would consider this to be an important obstacle to financial integration. I should like to note here that our first publication of indicators of financial integration will be further expanded. While the first publication contains a total of 20 indicators, covering the main euro financial and banking markets, the coverage of our indicators will be further enhanced, in particular by adding indicators relating to the integration of market infrastructures and financial institutions. Second, starting from our definition of financial integration, two broad categories of indicators are considered: price-based indicators and quantity-based indicators. Price-based indicators measure discrepancies in asset prices based on their geographic origin. In a perfectly integrated market, prices of assets with similar characteristics should mostly be influenced by common euro area factors. Quantity-based indicators are used to investigate the extent to which investors engage in cross-border asset portfolios. Finally, it should be noted that the indicators are either computed or model-based. Computed indicators - such as standard deviations and ratios - are summary measures of the underlying data, whereas the model-based indicators are derived from econometric models. Obviously, these estimates depend on the specific set of modelling assumptions. Now that I have addressed these conceptual issues, I will report some of the results that form our assessment of the state of financial integration in the euro area. Now and then, I will additionally mention some figures for the United States that usefully serve as a comparison for the euro area. Our first publication covers the money market, the government bond market, the corporate bond market, the equity market and the banking markets. The euro acted as a major catalyst for the integration of the euro financial markets. However, the degree of integration differs between market segments, with integration being more advanced in those market segments that are closer to the single monetary policy, above all the money market. Our indicators measure the financial integration of the euro money market based on the dispersion of lending rates for actual transactions or rates offered by EONIA, EURIBOR and EUREPO panel banks. The unsecured interbank deposit market was almost perfectly integrated right at the start of the Monetary Union. This is a for monetary policy implementation, since only an integrated interbank market ensures an even distribution of central bank liquidity and a homogeneous level of short-term interest rates across the euro area. This rapid integration has been mostly supported by the establishment of the related payment system infrastructure, i.e. our TARGET system that has been operational since the first day of Monetary Union. In fact, the cross-country standard deviation of the average overnight lending rates among euro area countries was as low as three basis points in early 1999 and has since decreased even further to just one basis point. By comparison, in January 1998, i.e. one year before the start of Monetary Union, this indicator stood higher than 130 basis points. Our indicators for the one-month and 12-month maturities also consistently show a highly integrated unsecured money market. While the respective cross-country standard deviation of EURIBOR lending rates among euro area countries stood at more than 100 basis points for the one-month maturity, and at around 50 basis points for the 12-month rates in January 1998, since early 1999 both of these indicators have shown values not higher than, and normally below, one basis point. Finally, our indicators also confirm a relatively high degree of integration for the repo market. The EUREPO index was launched in March 2002, and since then, the euro area cross-country standard deviation of the one-month EUREPO rates has been around, and normally below, one basis point. The indicator for the 12-month maturity shows a standard deviation of around, and normally below, two basis points. The decisive role of the euro in enhancing financial market integration is also visible in the interest rate derivatives markets. The total of euro interest rate OTC derivatives contracts reaches a daily turnover of around EUR 380 billion, and is thereby larger than the US dollar segment (a daily turnover of around EUR 290 billion). A particularly important segment is the euro interest rate swap market (including, for example, the euro overnight index swap market). This is, in fact, the largest interest rate swap market in the world. With a daily turnover of around EUR 250 billion, the euro interest rate swap market is about one third larger than the equivalent US dollar segment (around EUR 160 billion). The least integrated money market segment is the short-term securities market. Compared with the equivalent US commercial paper market, which has an outstanding amount of around EUR 1.3 trillion, the aggregate size of the commercial paper and certificates of deposit markets in Europe is around EUR 0.8 trillion. In addition, while the US market is integrated, the short-term securities markets in Europe continue to be segmented, with de facto several markets based in several market places. Issuers and investors in the European short-term paper markets therefore face reduced depth and liquidity and less diversification opportunities than in the US. I now turn to the government bond market. Our indicators of the integration in government bond markets encompass the standard deviation of government bond yield spreads, measures based on regressions, such as the evolution of beta coefficients, and variance ratios. Government bond markets have achieved a very high degree of integration, mainly due to the disappearance of intra-euro area exchange rate risk. Since then, government bond yields in different euro area countries have been driven mainly by euro area-wide factors and news. Naturally, one should not expect common factors to fully explain changes in bond yields, as different assessments concerning credit and liquidity risk will continue to have an impact on bond yields in different countries. The euro corporate bond market has grown considerably since 1999. While this market had been predominantly open to the highest quality credits, it has since broadened to facilitate the funding needs of riskier issuers. However, the gap with the US market is still large in terms of absolute size, with the outstanding volume of bonds issued by non-financial corporations of around EUR 2.5 trillion in the United States being around three times larger than in the euro area. The degree of integration of the euro corporate bond market is reasonably high. The yield on a corporate bond depends typically on a number of factors, such as the credit rating, time-to-maturity, liquidity and cash flow structure. Our indicators for the state of integration of the euro corporate bond market are based on (econometric) models, investigating whether or not risk-adjusted yield spreads have a systematic country component. Our studies suggest that this market segment is fairly integrated in the sense that the country of issuance is only of marginal importance in explaining yield differentials. Other market segments have even more potential for greater integration. In fact, the euro area equity markets are still quite fragmented, but a gradual integration process is ongoing. For example, our indicators show that stock prices across the euro area increasingly react to euro area-wide factors and news. Another indicator to measure the degree of integration in euro area equity markets is the relative importance of sector versus country-based investment strategies. The indicator is derived by calculating and comparing the cross-sector dispersion with the cross-country dispersion of equity returns. The more integrated the euro area equity market, the greater the benefits of spreading investments across sectors as opposed to country-based equity investment strategies. Our statistics show that the elimination of intra-euro area currency risk has encouraged integration in the sense that the ""home bias"" in the equity holdings of institutional investors has been significantly reduced. Nevertheless, the country effect is still too important for it to be concluded that the euro area equity market is satisfactorily integrated. As regards banking markets, integration is generally lagging behind, and the degree of integration is different for the types of banking activities, i.e. capital market-related activities, interbank (or wholesale) activities, and retail banking. Cross-border interbank loans and holdings of securities have, in relative terms, experienced substantial growth. While securities issued by non-monetary financial institutions of another euro area country accounted for only 16% of the securities held by euro area monetary financial institutions (MFIs) at the end of 1997, this share has now reached almost 40%, pointing to a higher degree of capital market integration in the euro area. In addition, although loans granted between domestic MFIs still account for more than 50% of the total EU MFI loans, the respective euro area cross-border activity has increased from just 15% at the end of 1997 to around 23% at present. Last but not least, integration in retail banking has, by contrast, not progressed to any great extent, as shown by both price and quantity-based indicators. For example, while the share of euro area cross-border MFI loans granted to non-MFIs stood at 2% at the end of 1997, this figure has risen to no more than 3.5% today. Also, taking a price-based indicator, the cross-country standard deviation of interest rates on consumer credit has been rather high and constant, on average 0.9% over the past three years. To give a final indicator for the level of retail banking integration, the cross-country dispersion of interest rates on lending for house purchase amounts to, on average, 0.5% over the past three years, with no clear declining trend visible as yet, thereby confirming the not very benign picture of euro area credit market integration. An analysis of the state of financial integration and the monitoring of its progress over time are prerequisites for possible action in those fields where the analysis has identified gaps and shortcomings. Let me provide you with a few examples of how the Eurosystem contributes to fostering financial integration. I will list them using the same sequence of financial and banking markets that I used when describing the state of financial integration. Starting with the money market, the obvious example for a central banking service that is conducive to fostering financial integration is the large-value payment system, ""TARGET"", that we run. In addition, the launch of the single shared platform, ""TARGET2"", is planned for November 2007. This will enhance financial integration even further, given that it will provide a harmonised service level, ensuring a level playing field for banks across Europe, which will be supported by a single price structure for domestic and cross-border payments. Another example is the short-term paper market. Here, I expect that its current fragmentation will be reduced with the help of the so-called Short-Term European Paper (STEP) initiative, which was set up and is being led by ACI - The Financial Markets Association. This initiative aims to promote the convergence of standards and practices prevailing in the European short-term securities markets through market players' voluntary compliance with the standards set out in the STEP Market Convention, which covers aspects such as information disclosure, documentation, settlement, and the provision of data for the production of STEP statistics. The STEP initiative is expected to provide an impulse towards integration, thereby increasing the depth and liquidity of this market in Europe. The promoters of this initiative expect the first STEP-labelled programme in early 2006. The Eurosystem acts as a catalyst to support this market-led initiative. Specifically, the Eurosystem will provide technical support for the labelling process for some time and will produce and publish STEP statistics on yields and volumes on an ongoing basis. Furthermore, the European Master Agreement (EMA) is another example of integration relating to the legal infrastructure. The EMA, a major European legal documentation initiative, contributes to financial integration by permitting cross-border trading on the basis of a master agreement which is both a domestic and a pan-European standard. It is the first project undertaken at European level to develop a pan-European market standard for trading operations. The EMA is a multi-lingual, multi-jurisdictional, multi-product master agreement which may be used, in particular, to document repurchase agreements, foreign exchange, derivatives and securities loans. The ECB participated in the drafting of the EMA and has been using it since 2001 for all its European foreign reserve management and own funds repo counterparties. Since June 2005, the ECB has also been using the EMA for its derivatives operations in 15 European jurisdictions, thereby maximising cross-product netting, cross-product margining possibilities and reducing documentation basis risk. As regards the further integration of securities (bonds and equity) markets, a prominent role should be attached to the securities clearing and settlement infrastructure. The Eurosystem strongly supports further integration in the securities infrastructure, the lack of which has, among others, also been identified by the Giovannini Group as a barrier to integration that should be removed. To this end, the ECB participates in the Clearing and Settlement Advisory and Monitoring Experts Group and in the Legal Certainty Group, set up by the European Commission. Furthermore, and also in the central bank's capacity to act as a catalyst for collective private-sector activities, meetings are held with the Contact Group on Euro Securities Infrastructures, bringing together representatives from the banking and securities settlement industry of the euro area to discuss the further integration of the euro securities settlement industry. Furthermore, I would like to highlight the work that we have been carrying out since 2001 in cooperation with the Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR), where we published in October last year 19 standards for securities clearing and settlement systems in the European Union. These ESCB-CESR standards aim to adapt international recommendations to the European context. They promote a harmonised approach and are conducive to the integration of EU capital markets, placing emphasis on common solutions and interoperability between systems. Last but not least, I come to the banking and retail markets. I will use the mortgage market as an example. The importance of this retail market segment is evident from its size, where an outstanding volume of more than EUR 4 trillion in residential mortgage debt in the EU corresponds to around 40% of EU GDP. I mentioned earlier that the cross-country dispersion of euro area interest rates on lending for house purchase did not show a clear declining trend over the past years. Furthermore, if one compares the euro area mortgage market with its US counterpart, it is revealed that, over the past three years, the cross-country dispersion of rates in the euro area was higher than the cross-regional dispersion of mortgage rates in the United States. All this suggests that the euro area mortgage market is not yet fully integrated. In this respect, I highlight a recent initiative by the European Commission that led to a Green Paper on Mortgage Credit in the EU. With its public consultation, the Commission launched a broad discussion about the possible benefits and ways of further integrating European mortgage markets. The Eurosystem is of the view that this kind of investigation into the possible benefits of and obstacles to the further integration of European mortgage markets is very much warranted. The Eurosystem therefore explained its view on this in detail in a recently published contribution to this consultation on the Commission's Green Paper. More generally, this contribution can also be seen as an example of the Eurosystem's role in providing advice on shaping the legislative and regulatory framework for the financial system to be conducive to financial integration. And, as with securities markets, retail markets also need an integrated infrastructure in order to reap in full the benefits of financial integration. The European citizens' possible cross-border banking activities also depend on the possibilities and costs of cross-border payments. This brings me to the last example of Eurosystem activities that I would like to highlight today, namely the Eurosystem's support, together with that of the European Commission, for the banking industry's initiative to create the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA). The first SEPA milestone is that, by 2008, European citizens should be able to make payments throughout the euro area from a single bank account, using a single set of payment instruments, as easily and safely as in the national context today. This means that, in parallel to national instruments, banks should provide to customers also SEPA instruments. A second milestone involves that national infrastructures migrate to a pan-European payments infrastructure by the end of 2010, so that full competition applies to all euro area infrastructures. The way to achieve this would be to demand complete interoperability between SEPA compliant infrastructures. Acting as a catalyst for private-sector activities, the ECB actively supports the European Payments Council (EPC), and high-level coordination between the Eurosystem and the banking industry takes place on a regular basis. Furthermore, the ECB has arranged a number of meetings to involve SEPA end-users, including consumer organisations, small and medium-sized enterprises, retailers and corporate treasurers. The ECB recognises as a major achievement the EPC's work on defining standards and business rules for SEPA cards, credit transfers and direct debits. At the same time, we note the large amount of work that is still ahead. For this, we count on the industry's commitment to undertake the necessary SEPA investments and to deliver the results of the SEPA project as foreseen. My references to the slower pace of integration of banking and retail markets leads me to the last theme I would like to address today, namely the EU policy framework for financial integration. Among others, the further integration of retail markets has been targeted by ongoing or future projects, such as a White Paper on mortgage credit, to be released in 2006, and a proposal for a Payments Services Directive. In some ways, this also complements the Financial Services Action Plan (FSAP) of the past five years that focused mainly on the wholesale markets. In line with its provision of advice on shaping the legislative and regulatory framework for the financial system to be conducive to financial integration, in summer 2005, the Eurosystem provided its response to the European Commission's consultation on the priorities for financial services policies over the next five years. As we explained in our contribution, the Eurosystem supports the key policy orientations of the financial services policy over the next years. With regard to the regulatory framework of the financial system, there is a need to proceed with the adoption of the remaining measures envisaged in the FSAP and hence with the effective implementation and enforcement of such measures at national level. Also, we agree with the Commission's proposal for ""better regulation"" based on open, transparent and evidence-based policy-making, including an ex ante evaluation of possible costs and benefits. As far as the supervisory framework is concerned, in order to realise the economies of scale and scope offered by financial integration, the framework should facilitate the development of cross-border consolidation of financial institutions and the cross-border exchange of services and products, while maintaining the effectiveness of supervisory standards and action in a more integrated financial system. It is our view that the current institutional set-up, and in particular the Lamfalussy framework, provides the appropriate structure for achieving these broad policy objectives, if it is used to the maximum extent possible. To this end, the work of the Level 3 Committees, i.e. the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS), the Committee of European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Supervisors (CEIOPS) and the Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR), is expected to strongly promote supervisory convergence and cooperation. Furthermore, in a more and more integrated financial system, increased supervisory cooperation across financial sectors is required.

1508,r060608a_ECB,euro area,2006-06-08,Intervention as panellist in Session 1 on Monetary Policy at a conference on “Central banks in the 21st century” organised by Banco de España,no_info,0,"Let me start by saying a few words of thanks and extending my best wishes to this great institution, which is celebrating 150 years of bearing the prestigious name of Banco de Espana. I would like to thank Governor Caruana and the Banco de Espana for organising this excellent conference and for inviting me to participate in this panel. To kick off this conference, Alan Blinder has prepared an impressive survey which presents and assesses the main critical issues that are currently truly relevant for monetary policy-makers. He has demonstrated again an admirable ability to blend top academic research with good central banking practice and common sense to produce this insightful and stimulating review. Alan's list of 16 questions regarding monetary policy is fairly long and, indeed, somewhat longer than the list he presented in 1999 at the first ECB conference. This may seem discouraging and might suggest that not much progress has been made over the past six years. However, the two lists are not identical: some of the original questions have been resolved, and new ones have arisen. Therefore, there are still plenty of critical issues concerning the science and art of central banking that need to be addressed, and Alan himself provides answers to most of them. Given the wide range of questions raised by Alan, I will inevitably have to be selective and do some cherry-picking, by focusing on issues that are more controversial or more interesting from my perspective, and that can also be discussed adequately in the limited time available. I will discuss a number of issues regarding the objectives and strategy of monetary policy, aspects of policy implementation including central bank communication and transparency, the relationship between monetary policy and financial markets, and the implications of globalisation for monetary policy. I would like to begin by addressing some critical questions concerning the institutional design of monetary policy, in particular issues relating to monetary policy objectives. These include fundamental issues regarding the choice and ranking of policy goals, as well as other important subjects pertaining to the strategy and analysis employed in pursuing these goals. A fundamental development in monetary policy-making over the past two decades has been the emergence of a strong consensus - or at least a general acceptance of the view - that the overriding aim of monetary policy should be the attainment and preservation of price stability. This view is shared by an overwhelming majority of central banks and academic economists. It is presumably also shared by the political authorities, as manifested by the legislation that has been enacted in many countries to enable central banks to pursue this objective. The roots of this consensus are the greater appreciation of the benefits of price stability for durable economic growth and social welfare; the recognition that monetary policy can effectively determine price developments over the medium and longer run, but cannot permanently and systematically influence economic activity; growing evidence that independent central banks can pursue price stability effectively while minimising output volatility. Despite the general agreement on the primacy of price stability as a monetary policy objective, there are differences of opinion on several related issues: how this goal is linked and ranked relative to other policy objectives; what is the appropriate strategy for policy formulation; whether and how the concept of price stability should be defined in quantitative terms; how to operationally specify a final policy target and in particular the measures of inflation and economic activity that central banks should aim to control. These differences are not inconsequential for the formulation and conduct of monetary policy. In examining these issues, Alan uses, for part of his analysis and assessment, an objective function for monetary policy that is often employed in academic work: a quadratic loss function that penalises a weighted average of the deviations of the inflation rate ( ) from its target value ( *) and the deviation of real output ( ) or the unemployment rate ( , ). Although, as Alan acknowledges, this particular specification of policy-makers' objectives is motivated (if not dictated) by ""mathematical convenience"" (in the theoretical analysis of monetary policy, given that it facilitates the derivation of results, especially under conditions of uncertainty, the fact is that it imposes unrealistic constraints on policy-makers' preferences and does not appropriately describe the objectives of many central banks, including the ECB. In the case of the ECB, the Treaty establishing the European Community states that ""the primary objective of the ESCB shall be to maintain price stability"" and that, ""without prejudice to the objective of price stability, the ESCB shall support the general economic policies in the Community with a view to contributing to the achievement of the objectives of the Community"", which include a high level of employment and sustainable and non-inflationary growth. In the euro area, monetary policy goals are therefore not stated, and cannot be expressed in terms of their relative importance (which, in principle, cannot be captured by choosing the size of the parameter defining the relative weight), but are clearly specified in a hierarchical (or lexicographic) manner, which emphasises the overriding importance of price stability and also implies that policy should not be formulated in terms of an objective function which trades off inflation volatility against output volatility. The underlying proposition is that, in general, price stability contributes to reducing output volatility. I should also briefly mention that the selected loss function does not seem to be able to capture the points raised by some economists concerning the potentially asymmetric costs of high and low unemployment, relative to its natural or NAIRU level. It is also unclear as to whether it can provide an appropriate representation of policy preferences for those central banks that have opted for an inflation-targeting strategy and at the same time aim to support a high level of economic activity. This observation partly relates to the specific functional form and partly to the results of Svensson (1997), who has shown that the parameters of a Taylor rule are not related in a straightforward way to the relative weight of inflation and output deviations from their target values. Given the choice and ranking of objectives, a key aspect of the policy framework is the strategy adopted for pursuing them, which involves decisions concerning the method of analysis and the quantitative definition and operational target for price stability. The approaches chosen by central banks differ, but they are converging. Many central banks have opted for an inflation-targeting strategy based on a single analytic model and aimed at an inflation rate of 2% or 2.5% as the midpoint of the target range. The ECB has adopted a more general and eclectic strategy that includes both economic analysis and monetary analysis. It has also adopted a quantitative definition of price stability - an increase in the price level that does not exceed 2% - and, given this definition, it aims to maintain inflation at ""below but close to 2%"". The Federal Reserve has not yet formally adopted a precise, operational price stability or inflation target (though implicitly a target for core inflation at 1.75%-2% has recently been used). We have found the selection and announcement of a quantitative definition of price stability extremely important for policy formulation as well as for guiding and anchoring inflation expectations to price stability. Moreover, it provides a yardstick for the assessment of the effectiveness of monetary policy and for democratic accountability. However, despite the adoption of a quantitative definition of price stability to orient our policy, the ECB does not use the term ""inflation targeting"" to describe its own strategy - even if Alan tends to put us in the same camp. Presumably, there must be some real differences warranting this position, and indeed there are. First, for the Governing Council of the ECB, inflation projections based on a single model are not the only all-encompassing tool on the basis of which decisions and communication are organised; our projections are seen as important input to our economic analysis, but are strictly staff projections and one element of our economic analysis. A second major difference is that we assign an important role to monetary analysis in assessing the medium to long-term inflation trends and risks. A final point is that our policy framework has a medium-term orientation but we have eschewed specifying a fixed time horizon for our assessment of the outlook for price stability. At the same time, there are no major differences in the practical implementation of monetary policy strategies among price stability-oriented central banks and, with regard to at least some aspects of the policy framework, remaining differences are diminishing. In recent years, for example, we have observed a greater focus by some inflation-targeting central banks on the medium and long-term horizon and on the role of money and credit growth in determining medium to long-term inflation trends and in influencing asset price dynamics. Despite the convergence of many aspects of the monetary policy strategies, there are still important differences. One such difference is whether the operational target for inflation should be the headline or a core measure of inflation. Alan has declared that he is firmly in the ""core"" camp for several reasons. He argues that a central bank should aim at core inflation because it cannot effectively control headline inflation given its inability to offset supply shocks; it can better forecast future headline inflation on the basis of past core-inflation dynamics, and targeting core inflation is likely to result in more sensible monetary policy in the presence of supply (energy price) shocks. In this debate, I am firmly in the ""headline inflation"" camp. Let me explain. To begin with, our responsibility as central bankers is to preserve the stability of the overall, general price level which determines the public's purchasing power and social welfare. The inability to offset immediately supply-side shocks does not change this responsibility, while the medium-term orientation of our monetary policy clearly indicates that we do not aim to offset such unanticipated shocks over the short run. I believe it is important to differentiate the role of a core inflation measure in the definition of the central bank's objective from its relevance and potential usefulness in the assessment of the outlook for price stability and the formulation of policy. With regard to the monetary policy strategy, the price index used to define the medium-term objective should be a comprehensive and credible measure of citizens' purchasing power which cannot be criticised for being defined in an arbitrary manner. Core inflation measures fall short of this requirement because of the exclusion of important items relevant for the public and because of the degree of arbitrariness in the definition of core inflation. Another issue concerns the use of an appropriate measure of core inflation as an information variable in the formulation of monetary policy. There are two pertinent questions: first, which measure of core inflation provides reliable information about domestic underlying inflationary pressures by removing short-term noise from headline inflation due to transitory shocks, and second, whether different measures of underlying inflation can better forecast developments in headline inflation. Many concepts of core inflation have been proposed, such as HICP inflation excluding energy and food components, trimmed means of the HICP sub-indexes and model-based measures. While the proposed different core measures can be helpful in removing transient noise from trend inflation, there is no strong evidence in the euro area that a specific core inflation measure is a reliable tool for forecasting headline inflation at relevant horizons. Our experience and analysis leads to different conclusions than those derived from the US experience cited by Alan (see Blinder and Reis, 2005). In the euro area, the gap observed between headline and core inflation often closes with core inflation increasing and converging towards higher headline inflation. For example, in the euro area in the period 1999-2002, a considerable positive gap opened up between the headline inflation and the underlying measure which excludes food and energy prices. However, following a period of strong demand growth, this gap was closed not by a significant drop in headline inflation, but by a delayed upward movement in this ""core"" measure. Following the indication of the core measure on this occasion would have been a costly policy mistake (see ECB, 2005). This episode shows that the usefulness of core measures might be generally limited, and that medium-term inflationary pressures are very much related to various underlying causes and processes as well as to the nature and dynamics of the shocks affecting the economy. Consequently, the optimal monetary policy response cannot be determined on the basis of a simple rule relying on a measure of core inflation; it depends on the size, nature and persistence of shocks affecting the economy. And such shocks cannot, in general, be identified and their effects cannot be adequately assessed only by using a measure of core inflation. A point that should be emphasised with regard to the appropriate response of monetary policy to supply shocks is that their ultimate effects on inflation and output dynamics will obviously and crucially depend on the reaction of economic agents, especially of the participants in product and labour markets, which is influenced by their expectations about the response of the central bank to such disturbances. The fact that no significant second-round effects have been observed in the recent past does not imply that they will not emerge in the future, if an accommodative monetary policy is maintained, especially as the economic recovery gains momentum. If a central bank adjusts the monetary policy stance only when second-round effects have become clearly visible, by relying on some measure of core inflation, its response will come too late and it is likely that a larger dose of monetary tightening would be required than would have been the case if it had adjusted earlier on the basis of its assessment of all pertinent risks to future headline inflation. The strategy of the ECB, therefore, relies on a comprehensive analysis of the shocks affecting headline inflation as well as on a wide variety of economic indicators and methods of analysis in order to assess the outlook for price stability over the medium term. And, importantly, the medium-term orientation of the ECB's monetary policy strategy ensures that in our assessment we appropriately discount short-term volatility due to transitory supply shocks. The second big theme I want to address is central bank transparency and, in particular, Alan's suggestion that central banks should announce their conditional monetary policy plans, at least as part of their forecasts. When discussing the issues of transparency and communication, it is important to distinguish between general aims and principles, on the one hand, and practical and effective means of fulfilling them, on the other. I fully agree with Alan on the importance of, and the reasons for, (maximum) central bank transparency and I partly share his view on the limits to (optimal) transparency. But I draw different conclusions about the usefulness of pre-announcing an explicit path for future policy rates over a period of one to two years. This is because of my different assessment of the nature and extent of the uncertainty we face, the quality of available information and the limitations to our analytical methods, which have implications for the effectiveness of Alan's proposed communication strategy. A high degree of transparency is an essential element of the democratic accountability of central banks. Transparency also enhances the effectiveness of monetary policy by helping to guide the expectations of economic agents and bring them into line with policy objectives and actions. It is particularly important that markets and the public at large have a good understanding of the systematic and conditional conduct of monetary policy by the central bank, so that expectations about future price developments and the path of policy rates are in line with the central bank's mandate. For all these reasons, the ECB has always striven to be as transparent as possible and has tried to communicate clearly, and by a variety of means, its policy objective, its strategy, its assessment of the economic situation, as well as the outlook for price stability and the associated risks. Are there limits to the transparency of central banks? Alan's view on this issue is nicely presented by paraphrasing Einstein: ""Every central bank has to be as transparent as possible, but not more so."" The crucial issue is the meaning or interpretation of ""but not more so"". Alan argues that the meaning of this proposition is that the default option should be disclosure, unless there are good reasons for the central bank to maintain the confidentiality of certain information in its role of supervisor or fiscal agent. In my view, there is another interpretation of the meaning ""but not more than possible"", which takes into account the limitations of our analytical tools and the uncertainty surrounding the medium to longer-term outlook. This interpretation also relates to the second objective of transparency, which is to provide economic agents with useful information so as to enhance clarity and understanding about policy actions and to reduce pertinent uncertainty. If future policy actions over a fairly long time horizon depend on projections about the future paths of many exogenous variables that are inevitably characterised by uncertainty, as well as on various shocks that by definition cannot be anticipated, and, more importantly, when there is considerable uncertainty about certain structural or behavioural parameters of the economy, then providing explicit guidance on the future policy rates, on the underlying projections and assumptions, generally involves risks that can undermine the usefulness of providing more information on the central bank's policy intentions. Let me elaborate on some of the risks. First, the general public may fail to fully understand that a pre-announced path of future policy rates is conditional and that changes in the state of the economy will require changes to this policy path. Eventual deviations from the previously projected policy path may therefore be viewed, at least by many who are not experts in monetary economics, as a failure of the central bank to follow its announced intentions. This could damage its credibility, even if it is conducting policy in an optimal manner. Second, the central bank is often faced with a high degree of uncertainty, including ""Knightian"" uncertainty, about the functioning of the economy and the response of economic agents to shocks and policy actions. Under such circumstances, it is difficult to determine an optimal or appropriate path of policy rates over a long time horizon and to agree about such a policy path in a policy-making committee, and to properly convey to the public all the conditions underlying such a path. Finally, I do not think that publishing a path of future policy rates, which is mechanically derived from an empirically estimated reaction function, would be helpful. On the contrary, it would be difficult to explain the difference between this path and the one decided by the decision-making body in the context of a forward-looking strategy with a medium-term orientation. Confusion rather than greater clarity may be the outcome of implementing such an approach. For this reason, I suggest that a central bank should be as transparent as possible, but no more so than is realistically useful for enhancing the clarity and understanding of the future monetary policy stance. This does not mean that central banks cannot give qualitative guidance about the future policy stance by means of official statements, particularly in special circumstances when the size and balance of risks to the outlook for price stability dictates the provision of such guidance or when the central bank believes that market expectations about future monetary policy are deviating significantly from its policy intentions as determined by its own assessment. However, I share some of Alan's considerations on the limits and drawbacks of macroeconomic projections based on a constant interest rate assumption. As you know, in order to improve the overall consistency and forecast quality of the Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, we recently decided to change the assumption about the future path of short-term interest rates that is incorporated in the staff projections. With the projections released today, we have started to produce macroeconomic projections that are conditional on the path of future interest rates expected by the markets, as embedded in the yield curve and in futures prices. This approach corresponds to the second option in Alan's paper and addresses the concerns expressed by eliminating an internal inconsistency and improving transparency. It will not solve all of his concerns, but it should mitigate some of them. I will turn now to the questions in Alan's list that concern the relationship between monetary policy and financial markets. In Question 14, Alan asks: how should central banks react to asset price bubbles? To answer this properly, I would need at least another 20 minutes. Unfortunately, I do not have that much time, but let me make two remarks. First, I agree with Alan that asset price bubbles are difficult to identify in real time and are thus often only identified . This notwithstanding, it appears to me that there are a number of tools that can help identify the emergence of bubbles. The ECB does not target asset prices, but pays close attention to asset price movements with a view to preserving the stability of consumer prices over longer horizons. In this regard, the role of money and monetary analysis in the ECB's strategy helps us to assess developments in asset prices and the degree to which they pose a risk to price stability over the longer term. Second, excessive appreciations and subsequent rapid reversals in asset prices could have very high costs for price stability and for the real economy. Therefore, a policy of only ""mopping up after"" - to use Alan's terminology - could have worked on some specific occasions, but this may not always be the case while, at the same time, it might create moral hazard problems. In light of this, a central bank may want to consider a policy of carefully ""leaning against the wind"" under certain, clearly exceptional, circumstances. It would then adopt a somewhat tighter policy stance in the face of an inflating asset market than would otherwise be the case if confronted with a similar macroeconomic outlook under more normal market conditions. Given the uncertainty surrounding the appropriate monetary policy stance under such circumstances, it could consider to err on the side of caution by trying to avoid feeding the bubble with an overly accommodative policy. These issues, which have been extensively discussed, deserve further analysis and consideration. My final remarks relate to the last, very challenging and open question raised by Alan on the global responsibilities of the main central banks. This is an important question that cannot be answered in a simple, straightforward manner and in a limited period of time. And Alan does not provide an answer, either. I would like to pose, however, a set of related questions on the implications of globalisation for monetary policy. In a globalised economy, should the role and orientation of monetary policy be changed? Should the framework for analysis and policy formulation be amended? Is the required analysis for setting policy becoming more demanding? The direct and brief answers I recently gave to these questions are: no, no and yes to some extent. It is sometimes argued that the monetary policy of a major central bank should help guide the domestic economy's adjustment to the evolving global economic environment and the competitive pressures associated with globalisation; and that it should foster the adjustment of global imbalances and even assume responsibility for the smooth functioning of the global economy. In my opinion, globalisation does not affect the central role and overriding responsibility of central banks to preserve price stability ""at home"". On the contrary, maintaining price stability in a rapidly evolving, globalised economy that may influence the dynamics of inflation in various ways becomes more essential and challenging, particularly in situations where adverse inflation shocks or inflationary pressures in some economies are now more easily transmitted to others. Consequently, if the primary objectives of monetary policy are unaffected by globalisation, the appropriate strategic framework for analysis and policy formulation should remain the same. However, the analysis required for policy formulation will have to carefully take into account the various effects of globalisation on the dynamics of inflation, economic growth and asset prices. For example: in the a globalised economy, traditional measures of core inflation are even more difficult to interpret and use as indicators of underlying domestic inflationary pressures; the estimates of potential output are more difficult to calculate in a robust manner; and the measurement and usefulness of output gaps are subject to greater uncertainty than is usually the case. Consequently, our role and responsibilities as central bankers are fundamentally the same in the globalised economy, but the performance of our tasks may be becoming more challenging. Having said that, I would agree that other pertinent issues raised by Alan deserve careful consideration. Clearly, there are many questions still to be answered, and challenges to be addressed. We should, however, also not forget that during the last two decades, industrialised countries have experienced a marked reduction in the average level of inflation and in the volatility of both output and inflation. I have no doubt that improved economic policies, and better monetary policy in particular, have contributed, perhaps largely, to this development, and despite the room for potential further improvements, as suggested by Alan. On this optimistic note, which befits such a celebratory conference, I should like to conclude.

1533,r061004a_ECB,euro area,2006-10-04,Statement by the President of the ECB at the public hearing at the European Parliament on the interception of bank transfer data from the SWIFT system by the US secret services,trichet,1,"Madame la Presidente, Monsieur le President, Mesdames et Messieurs les membres de la commission des libertes civiles, de la justice et des affaires interieures, Mesdames et Messieurs les membres de la commission des affaires economiques et monetaires, Je suis ici aujourd'hui pour vous expliquer plus en detail le role de la BCE dans la surveillance de SWIFT apres que SWIFT a repondu aux citations a comparaitre emises par le Tresor americain en vertu de son Programme de traque du financement du terrorisme ( ). Comme je l'ai deja explique dans ma lettre du 3 aout 2006 en reponse a M. le Parlementaire Klinz, la BCE est membre du Groupe de surveillance de SWIFT ( - OG). Par consequent, je voudrais, dans la premiere partie de ma declaration, preciser les objectifs et le mandat de ce Groupe de surveillance. Dans un deuxieme temps, j'exposerai les contraintes juridiques decoulant des statuts du Systeme europeen de banques centrales et de la Banque centrale europeenne dans ce domaine, y compris le regime de confidentialite en vigueur. A la suite de la declaration de M. Praet, je serai a votre disposition pour repondre a toutes vos questions. Zunachst einmal mochte ich darauf eingehen, was die Aufsichtstatigkeiten der Zentralbanken umfassen und wie dies im Fall von SWIFT in der Praxis umgesetzt wird. Wie Ihnen bekannt sein durfte, sind die Zahlungs- und Wertpapierinfrastrukturen vielfaltigen Risiken ausgesetzt, beispielsweise Kreditrisiken, Liquiditatsrisiken und operationellen Risiken, die dem Systembetreiber, den Systemteilnehmern und auch der breiten Offentlichkeit Kosten verursachen konnen. Unter bestimmten Umstanden konnen diese Risiken sogar systemisch werden. Erfolgt namlich seitens einer Bank keine Verrechnung, kann dies in einigen Fallen die Fahigkeit anderer Banken, bereits abgewickelte Geschafte reibungslos zu verrechnen, beeintrachtigen und somit eine Kettenreaktion auslosen, die zur Destabilisierung des gesamten Finanzsystems fuhren kann. Similarly, delays in settling transactions by a participant will typically affect the ability of other participants to pay. If the functioning of the system as a whole is disrupted, its participants and possibly the general public might be adversely affected. In such cases, individual participants (or the system operator) externalise costs to other parties and therefore do not necessarily have sufficient incentives to act prudently and avoid risk. This is particularly true if the participants or operator assume that they are ""too big to fail"" and expect that a public authority will intervene in a crisis situation. The central bank oversight function represents one form of public involvement in controlling such systemic risks. It aims to ensure that both participants and operators have adequate incentives to act prudently, avoid risk and minimise social costs. SWIFT is the most important provider of messaging services for financial transactions in the world. As a consequence, the sound functioning of SWIFT is a precondition for the overall smooth functioning of payment and settlement systems and, as such, also for financial stability. As a matter of fact, any disruption of SWIFT's messaging activity could trigger further disruption amongst its users, which include a very large number of systemically important payment and settlement systems. In view of SWIFT's critical role in the smooth functioning of the global financial system, the G10 central banks decided to set up a special cooperative framework for the oversight of SWIFT. This oversight framework was formalised in 2004 through the establishment of the Oversight Group. The ECB participates in this Group, which is led by the National Bank of Belgium (NBB). The ECB's involvement in the oversight of payment and clearing systems is based on its role, under the EC Treaty, ""to promote the smooth operation of payment systems"". The safe and efficient functioning of market infrastructure, and of payment systems in particular, is also an indispensable precondition for the proper implementation of two other core central bank tasks, namely to maintain financial stability and to ensure price stability through the smooth implementation of monetary policy operations. The Oversight Group has been given a very specific mandate. Its role is not to assess the entirety of risks which may occur. Rather, the Oversight Group monitors SWIFT's activities only insofar as they are relevant to the smooth functioning of payment systems and to financial stability. To that end, it assesses whether SWIFT has in place the appropriate governance arrangements, risk management procedures and controls to prevent and/or address effectively the risks posed to the smooth functioning of payment systems and financial stability. The monitoring of activities that do not affect the proper functioning of market infrastructure and financial stability is outside the Oversight Group's remit. It is important to understand that SWIFT is not a ""payment"" or ""clearing"" system, or a financial institution. As a consequence, in performing their oversight role, the overseers of SWIFT have limited competences vis-a-vis SWIFT. Indeed, oversight of SWIFT is not based on a comprehensive legal framework, contrary to, for instance, the supervision of financial institutions. For example, the Oversight Group cannot impose any sanctions on SWIFT to enforce decisions. Therefore, overseers rely mainly on ""moral suasion"" to convince SWIFT of the need to improve the sound functioning of its systems. The Oversight Group was informed in 2002 about the subpoenas issued by the US Treasury. As you know, these subpoenas were part of a US programme to track terrorist financing, targeted to specific investigations. The Group considered that this matter would not have financial stability implications and therefore concluded that it fell totally outside the remit of its oversight role. I would like to stress that the SWIFT Oversight Group did not give SWIFT any kind of approval or ""blessing"" in relation to its compliance with the US subpoenas. The Oversight Group could not in fact have given such an authorisation, as it was outside its competence to do so. As the overseers' competences only relate to oversight, they are obliged to refrain from any actions that go beyond these parameters. SWIFT therefore remained solely responsible for its decisions concerning compliance with the US subpoenas. The question has recently been raised whether the Oversight Group should not have considered SWIFT's compliance with applicable data protection rules. However, the task of protecting personal data is outside the remit of the Group's oversight function, since it is unrelated to the functioning of market infrastructure and financial stability. If the Oversight Group were to assume this task, it would conflict with the competences assigned by the Data Protection Directive to national and EU data protection authorities. In this regard, SWIFT informed the Oversight Group that it had obtained significant protections and assurances from the US Treasury to ensure that the data concerned were used exclusively for the purpose of antiterrorist investigations. An audit commissioned by SWIFT also confirmed that there was no indication that the subpoenas and their implementation had any other purpose than the fight against terrorism. Let me now turn to the second topic, that is, why the ECB was unable to use the information it received in the context of the oversight framework for other purposes or to share such information with other relevant authorities. First, SWIFT has requested that the information it provides to the central banks in the context of oversight must only be used for oversight purposes. Second, the Memoranda of Understanding concluded by the NBB, in its capacity as lead overseer, with each individual G10 central bank involved in the cooperative oversight of SWIFT, including with the ECB, stipulate that all non-public information shared by the signatories, including information provided by SWIFT, must be treated as confidential and must also be subject to the respective obligations of professional secrecy of the signatories, as applicable. Third, the applicable obligations of the ECB, as referred to in the Memorandum of Understanding signed with the NBB, are laid down in Article 38 of the Statute of the ESCB, which imposes professional secrecy on the ECB. As I have explained, the SWIFT oversight function is not based on a comprehensive legal framework including powers to impose sanctions, but on ""moral suasion"". The tool of ""moral suasion"" can only work properly if there is a close dialogue and mutual trust between the overseers and SWIFT. In this context, a strict confidentiality regime is of the essence. After all, the oversight role involves the sharing of very sensitive information, and the disclosure of this information may have severe consequences. Although the ECB became aware of the subpoenas being imposed on SWIFT in June 2002, this information could neither be transmitted to third parties nor be made public. Moreover, the ECB has no authority to supervise SWIFT with regard to compliance with data protection laws. The difficult questions arising in that regard must be addressed by the relevant data protection authorities, as data protection is a matter which falls outside the ECB's competence. Let me now conclude my remarks with a brief summary of the main points I have made. First, the G10 central banks, including the ECB, perform the oversight of SWIFT under the leadership of the NBB. As such, our responsibilities are precisely to ensure that SWIFT has an appropriate framework in place to avoid systemic risks. In executing these responsibilities, the central banks - as overseers - rely not on a comprehensive legal framework, including powers to impose sanctions, but on ""moral suasion"". Second, compliance with the US subpoenas fell outside the context of financial stability and thus outside the remit of our oversight role. Third, we did not give SWIFT any blessing in relation to its compliance with these subpoenas. In fact, we could not have given any such authorisation even if we had wanted to, as this fell outside our competence. Therefore, SWIFT remained solely responsible for its decisions. The conclusion that SWIFT's compliance with the US subpoenas was and is beyond the remit of oversight by central banks remained unchallenged in the Belgian data protection authority's report of 27 September 2006.","['surveillance', 'swift', 'terrorisme', 'investigations', 'terrorism']","['surveillance swift', 'que swift', 'swift oversight', 'swift compliance', 'assesses swift']","['la surveillance swift', 'surveillance swift apres', 'groupe surveillance swift', 'authorities regard swift', 'surveillance swift og']"
1599,r070601b_ECB,euro area,2007-06-01,The outlook for the European economy,papademos,0,"Being in Athens, it seems appropriate to start with a reference to a great thinker who established his Lyceum not far from this auditorium: Aristotle once said To me, the connection to the regular membership meetings of the Institute of International Finance is obvious: the regular semi-annual gatherings of this broad and distinguished group have established a forum that is well-known for its excellence of debate and high-quality analysis. It is indeed a great pleasure and a privilege to have been invited by the Institute to be part of this session on key issues facing the global economy, and specifically to share some thoughts with you on the outlook for the European economy and its financial system. I will first discuss the prospects for growth and price stability in the euro area and provide an assessment of the ongoing structural changes in its economy, which may be establishing a new basis for higher sustainable growth. I will then briefly address some issues pertaining to the stability of the European financial system, focusing in particular on one of its features, the abundant liquidity which characterises both the European and global financial markets. The world economy has been experiencing a fairly long period of economic good times and the medium-term outlook for the global economy remains positive. Annual world real GDP growth averaged 5% over the last three years (2004-2006), and it is expected to remain robust, moderating only slightly to just below 5% in both 2007 and 2008. Global financial market conditions have remained, for the most part, very favourable. Except for a few episodes of market turbulence, notably in May and June 2006 and in late February and early March this year, financial markets have been characterised by unusually low (implied) volatility, very low risk premia and credit spreads, and rising equity prices. Indeed, for much of the time over the past three years, financial market volatility and risk premia have been falling, reaching historically low levels, while asset prices have been following a rising trend. Robust economic growth, macroeconomic stability and favourable financial market conditions have been mutually reinforcing. In particular, the low levels of short and long-term interest rates and the cost of capital have supported economic activity, while expectations of strong economic growth and price stability have contributed to the decline in financial market volatility and risk premia. The pace of global economic activity is becoming more balanced across the main economic regions. Despite a slowdown in the US economy this year, economic growth in Europe, Japan and, especially, in emerging market economies is forecast to remain robust. In the euro area, economic growth has progressively strengthened significantly. In 2006, real GDP expanded by 2.7% in the euro area, almost twice the growth rate of 1.4% recorded in the previous year, reflecting a strong increase in investment (by 4.7%) but also a pick-up in private consumption growth. Gross exports of goods and services rose by an impressive 8.3% and stimulated aggregate demand and domestic investment. The contribution of net exports to GDP growth in 2006 was relatively moderate (0.3 percentage point) because imports also rose significantly, but it was nevertheless greater than in the previous year (by 0.5 percentage point). Thus, for the euro area as a whole, GDP growth last year was mainly driven by the faster increase in domestic demand. Looking forward, incoming data as well as survey indicators confirm the view that the outlook for euro area growth remains positive. Eurostat's recent flash estimate of real GDP growth of 0.6% in the first quarter was slightly higher than expected, underlining the continuing strength of the euro area economy. Increases in industrial production and retail sales, as well as a further upsurge in various business confidence indicators, point to an expansion of euro area economic activity at solid rates in the coming quarters. Although indicators of private consumption have recently provided mixed signals, consumer confidence has remained unchanged but at the highest level since 2001. At the same time, the sustained strength of the global economy will continue to support euro area exports. All in all, however, the positive growth prospects for the euro area will continue to be driven primarily by the strength of domestic demand, and notably investment, which has risen significantly in recent quarters, benefiting from still very favourable financing conditions, strong corporate earnings and gains in business efficiency. In the spring forecast of the European Commission (released on 7 May 2007), euro area real GDP growth is forecast at 2.6% in 2007 and 2.5% in 2008. The ECB survey of professional forecasters, recently published (in the May edition of the ECB's Monthly Bulletin), points to similar, though slightly lower growth rates in 2007 and 2008. These growth forecasts and expectations are within the ranges of the ECB staff macroeconomic projections released in March 2007. The current upswing in economic activity has been accompanied by a steady improvement in the euro area labour markets. This has been a job-creating economic recovery. In 2006, employment rose by 1.4%, almost double the rate recorded in the previous year, and the number of employed persons increased by around 2 million in the euro area. The unemployment rate has steadily declined in recent quarters and dropped to 7.2% in March 2007, the lowest level observed since the introduction of the euro - and, indeed, since the official series began in 1993 - and is expected to decline further in the coming quarters. Such positive labour market dynamics provide the basis for solid growth in personal disposable income and help to improve consumer confidence; they thus underpin the outlook for private consumption and sustained economic growth in the euro area. While recent conjunctural developments have been very encouraging and the medium-term growth prospects remain favourable, ultimately the prosperity of the euro area economy will depend on its capacity to sustain a higher long-term rate of economic growth. The forecast growth rates for 2007 and 2008 (by the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and private sector institutions) are above the range of available estimates of the euro area's potential growth. Therefore, a key issue is whether structural changes underlying the ongoing expansion of the euro area economy imply a gradual improvement in its potential growth rate. Two fundamental determinants of potential growth, the rates of change in productivity and labour utilisation, have risen significantly over the past two years. Are these increases mainly cyclical, reflecting the upswing in activity, or partly a consequence of structural factors with a permanent positive impact? Starting with labour utilisation, we saw a significant improvement in the year 2006. This was not only the result of the decline in the unemployment rate that I mentioned earlier, but was also due to the continued increase in the labour force participation rate. In addition, though to a lesser extent, this improvement stems from a relatively stable number of hours worked per employed person, by contrast with the decline in hours worked observed in the past. What are the factors or forces that account for the recent increase in labour utilisation? It is partly related to the important labour market reforms implemented in many euro area countries, which, among other things, have increased the incentives to work. In addition, moderate wage developments have also contributed to stronger employment growth. In this context, I would like to recall that since the launch of the euro, employment in the euro area has risen by more than 12 million people. Looking ahead, we expect the labour market to continue to benefit from past reforms and others being implemented. That said, we cannot rest on our laurels: certain inefficiencies and rigidities in labour markets remain and should be tackled through further structural reforms, not least in view of the still unacceptably high level of unemployment - especially among the young - in comparison with other advanced economies. With regard to productivity, the second fundamental determinant of potential growth, developments in the euro area since the mid-1990s have been, on the whole, unsatisfactory, both compared with previous decades and relative to the productivity gains achieved in other major economies, notably the United States. More recently, however, the productivity performance of the euro area has improved. Annual labour productivity growth (output per person employed) increased from 0.2% per annum in the first quarter of 2005 to 1.8% in the fourth quarter of 2006. The crucial question is again whether this recent improvement is of a or nature. In real time, it is very difficult to distinguish a potential change in the longer-term trend from cyclical and temporary fluctuations in the productivity data. There is some evidence that, in certain sectors, and in a number of euro area countries, structural reforms and corporate restructuring have been raising productivity and are contributing to higher potential output growth. However, sectoral analysis - notably the fact that the recorded productivity gains were concentrated in the industrial sector and that there were limited improvements in the services sector - and survey evidence suggest caution and support the view that recent improvements in labour productivity have been mainly cyclical. It is thus too early to reach a verdict on the extent to which the observed acceleration in productivity growth since early 2005 represents a structural improvement for the euro area as whole beyond that resulting from cyclical dynamics. More information and analysis are certainly needed in order to reach any definite conclusions. Two pertinent conclusions emerge from this assessment: first, further reforms are undoubtedly necessary in order to foster permanently higher productivity growth; second, there is an encouraging message for all to see: . Improvements in productivity and labour utilisation growth which help to increase the euro area's potential growth also have implications for the conduct of monetary policy: for they can help to raise the ""speed limit"" of the euro area economy, meaning that the economy can attain a faster rate of sustainable growth that is compatible with price stability. This leads me to a discussion of price developments. In recent months, annual HICP inflation in the euro area has fluctuated at levels slightly below 2%, mainly reflecting developments in energy prices. In the short term, as a result of significant base effects deriving from last year's energy price volatility, and barring further increases in oil prices, annual inflation rates are likely to remain below 2% and may fall somewhat in the coming months, before rising again towards the end of the year to levels around 2%. What is relevant, however, for monetary policy is the outlook for price stability over the medium term. Over this policy-relevant horizon, the outlook for price developments remains subject to a number of upside risks. These relate notably to the increasing capacity utilisation in the euro area economy, the possibility of further oil price rises and additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those announced and decided thus far. More fundamentally, stronger than currently expected wage developments could pose significant upward risks to price stability, not least in view of the favourable momentum in labour markets. Moreover, monetary and credit developments and liquidity conditions also point to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. Recent monetary data confirm that the underlying rate of monetary expansion remains robust, in an environment of already ample monetary liquidity. The strength of monetary expansion is reflected in the continued rapid growth of M3, which stood at an annual rate of 10.4% in April 2007. What is behind these developments? The ongoing strength of monetary and credit expansion is due partly to the moderate level of interest rates and solid economic growth. However, the evolution of monetary aggregates can be volatile in the short run, and it has been affected by a number of factors. First, the flattening of the euro area yield curve in recent months has encouraged substitution into shorter-term monetary assets from longer-term instruments outside M3. Second, the growth of the ""other financial intermediaries"" (OFI) sector may accentuate this development, since institutional investors such as OFIs, which have become increasingly important over recent years, may be more sensitive to such yield differentials than households. Third, the shift in international investor sentiment in favour of the euro area economy has led to capital inflows, which - as foreigners purchase euro-denominated securities from domestic residents - have also contributed to the acceleration of M3 growth. Such phenomena suggest that some caution should be exercised in interpreting the latest annual growth rates. Nevertheless, they should not lead to the conclusion that the strong recent dynamism of M3 can be discounted. The fact remains that the underlying rate of monetary expansion continues to be strong. Higher policy rates and short-term interest rates are starting to influence monetary and credit dynamics, although as yet they have not significantly dampened their overall strength. The growth of credit to the private sector has moderated somewhat, though it seems to have stabilised at double-digit rates. Borrowing for financial transactions - notably in the context of securitisation activities, private equity transactions and leveraged buyouts - has supported strong rates of credit expansion. Credit extended for such purposes may not have the same immediate implications for aggregate demand as lending to finance investment or consumption spending. Nonetheless, such borrowing contributes to the accumulation of monetary liquidity in the euro area, as bank balance sheets expand. Given the vigorous monetary and credit growth in an environment of already ample liquidity, a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium to longer term. Accordingly, as stressed by the Governing Council already last month, strong vigilance is of the essence in order to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. This will support the solid anchoring of medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area at levels consistent with price stability. Let me now conclude with a brief assessment of the prospects for financial stability in the euro area. As I mentioned at the beginning of my presentation, the external macro-financial environment of the euro area financial system has been favourable. Credit quality in the euro area remains high, and it should be further underpinned by the positive economic outlook. Although there are some pockets of vulnerability in the euro area household and corporate sectors that have most likely increased, on average financial positions continue to be sound. Moreover, financial institutions, including banks and insurance companies, have shown improving financial results, and market participants expect profitability to remain strong in the foreseeable future. In late February and early March this year, the shock-absorbing capacity of the global and euro area financial systems was tested by the third significant burst of market volatility in the past two years. This has been weathered comfortably. Improvements in the risk management practices of financial firms contributed to ensuring that higher financial market volatility did not prevent the capital markets from facilitating the intermediation of capital. Nevertheless, the fact that the global and euro area financial systems have so far proven resilient to a series of adverse disturbances, while comforting, does not provide any grounds for complacency. The few episodes of sharply rising market volatility endured in the past two years were triggered by relatively small and transitory disturbances in an environment of strong macroeconomic fundamentals and abundant financial market liquidity. Therefore, it is unlikely that these episodes can provide sufficient guidance on how the financial system would perform in the event of larger shocks that could trigger a more material reappraisal of risks, or a change in risk appetite, at a less favourable stage of the credit cycle. Moreover, previously identified sources of risk and vulnerability to financial system stability remain. And some of these vulnerabilities could be quickly exposed if financial market liquidity were to decline abruptly and sharply, for example as a result of a sudden decrease in investors' risk appetite. There are several interesting and policy-relevant issues pertaining to the existing abundance of financial market liquidity. They relate to its nature, causes, symptoms and consequences. It is essential to emphasise that financial market liquidity is a concept distinct from monetary liquidity, although there can be links between the two. Financial market liquidity can be defined as the ability of market participants to undertake securities transactions without triggering large changes in asset prices. The measurement of financial market liquidity is not straightforward, but the symptoms of abundant market liquidity are visible and include high leverage, low bond yields, low volatility, narrow credit spreads, and high market turnover. At the ECB, we have constructed a composite indicator of financial market liquidity for the euro area which is based on a methodology developed by the Bank of England. The indicator covers equity, bond and foreign exchange markets and aims to gauge three different dimensions of market liquidity: tightness, depth, and resilience. This particular indicator confirms that financial market liquidity in the euro area increased gradually from the late 1990s, rose significantly during 2003, and since then markets have remained very liquid. This indicator will be presented in the forthcoming edition of the ECB's Financial Stability Review, which will be published by mid-June. The increase in market liquidity in recent years seems to reflect partly, if not mostly, structural changes: for example, the liberalisation of international flows of funds, the securitisation of loans, the development of new financial instruments, and the rapidly growing market presence of highly active financial market participants, such as hedge funds. However, ample market liquidity could also reflect the ""search for yield"" and excessive risk appetite, indicating that liquidity risk could be underpriced. If this is the case, the current favourable market liquidity conditions could suddenly fade away if there were an abrupt and lasting increase in risk aversion. This could expose several underlying vulnerabilities and result in funding liquidity challenges for highly-leveraged institutions, the unwinding of carry trades and increasing credit spreads across the credit quality spectrum. The triggers that could expose vulnerabilities in the financial system cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty. However, financial institutions can prepare to mitigate potential disturbances before they occur through appropriate risk management arrangements and stress-testing. This is especially relevant today because the modern - developed and efficient - financial markets are - if I may employ a fitting image used before - like a highway: they get you where you want to go faster and more efficiently.

1800,r081215b_ECB,euro area,2008-12-15,The changing role of communication,trichet,1,"Ladies and gentlemen, A very warm welcome to all of you and thank you very much for your invitation to this club evening. I am happy to see many familiar faces in the audience tonight. Communication is a very important issue for all times. Being here in Frankfurt I am thinking of the very profound remark by Goethe: ""Niemand wurde in Gesellschaften viel sprechen, wenn er sich bewubt ware, wie oft er die anderen missversteht"". Nevertheless let me be bold enough to share with you some thoughts on communication and central banks. Communication is a key element for central banks to enhance the effectiveness, predictability and credibility of their monetary policy decisions. It becomes even more important in difficult times, when the economic outlook darkens and confidence weakens. It seems to me that central banks have improved their communication significantly in good times - and also in bad times - while some years ago communication was almost seen as a breach of their professional code. Why this change? Prior to the 1990s, central banks were very much working on the assumption that monetary policy effectiveness is greatest when the central bank systematically surprises the markets. The old belief was based on the notion that a central bank would measure the success of its actions by the extent to which economic activity could be raised and maintained above potential. If rational individuals already expect a certain change, they adjust their behaviour to that expectation. And that means that a monetary policy change would have no effect. In the past fifteen years, however, two important developments changed the theory and practice of central banking. First, the assumption that successful monetary policy acts by surprises and is made by a sequence of isolated steps has been the subject of thorough theoretical scrutiny and is now close to oblivion. It became clear that policy-making by surprises and isolated steps will bear no lasting effect on the economy once the public recognises the intentions that motivate the monetary authority. A monetary policy strategy made of isolated actions with the intention of boosting output above potential is bound to lose effectiveness because the short-term inflationary impact of that policy soon becomes embedded in price and wage expectations. Output and employment react in the very short-run, but in the medium term the economy suffers from a permanently higher inflation. The drive toward central bank independence provided an additional encouragement for transparency. Today an overwhelming majority of central banks across the globe is independent. The political and functional independence of central banks has been an important milestone in the way towards separating the authority to tax and spend from the power to control credit conditions. This separation has been the critical factor behind the general decline in inflation that we have observed over the past decades. But independence makes democratic accountability by the monetary authority all the more important. Many central banks have gone well beyond strict legal requirements in their pronouncements and communications than imposed by statutory accountability duties. The question is: Why? The reason rests on a simple though powerful insight: transparency renders monetary policy more effective. In a world in which policy-making by surprises has lost purpose, wide knowledge of the central bank's preferences and objectives can only serve as a coordination device for private beliefs. Anchoring expectations around the objectives of policy help coordinate the reactions of economic behaviours to the macroeconomic shocks along the appropriate path of adjustment that the central bank wants the economy to follow. Many central banks have therefore started to communicate their firm commitment to a nominal anchor, through the announcement of a precise definition of price stability. In many cases, central banks have gone further and spelled out a more general monetary policy strategy, and the analytical framework that is used by policy makers to assess the risks to the achievement of the central bank's objectives. A growing body of empirical evidence supports the assumption that transparent quantitative objectives and communication about the strategy reinforces monetary policy. For instance, a recent ECB study has shown that, following the introduction of a quantitative definition of price stability, inflation persistence has considerably diminished in the euro area, in Switzerland and in five inflation-targeting countries. While a large component of the switch in expectations formation is due to the genuine regime change, the exceptional of the adjustment would not have been possible without extensive communication about the onset of a new regime. Central bank communication - if supported by an established strategy - might well be a quiet and uneventful activity. In difficult times, however, when the economic outlook darkens exceptionally and confidence falters, communication becomes even more important to explain how the central bank intends to gear its policy. We have, on the one hand, the need to take and communicate swift action in implementing the appropriate monetary policy and in refinancing commercial banks. On the other hand, we need to communicate clearly the adherence of the central bank to the long-term objectives of policy and the way it intends to steer the policy course back to a normal path once the abnormal circumstances and risks have subsided. Communication in difficult times is inherently challenging for all central banks. However, it is facilitated by two fundamental components of the ECB's monetary policy strategy. The first is the quantification of a price stability objective. This grants a very significant level of predictability. The monetary policy easing that we enacted in the last two months - on a scale that is unprecedented in such a short period of time - was motivated by a sharp easing of inflation pressures looking into the future. The fact that markets could predict our moves with a fair degree of precision - despite the exceptional cloud of uncertainty that surrounds economic projections in present conditions - is a proof that our main mode of communication, via disclosure of the economic outlook as we perceive it, is effective and robust to extreme occurrences. The second component of the strategy which helps in times when expectations become disoriented is what we have called the ""separation principle"". In view of safeguarding its credibility and firmly anchoring long-term inflation expectations, it is crucial that the Governing Council sets the appropriate monetary policy stance on the basis of no other considerations than the delivery of price stability in the medium term. Once the appropriate level of the key interest rates has been set, the Executive Board of the ECB implements its monetary policy stance so that the effects of its interest rate decisions are transmitted to the financial markets and the real economy effectively. In this sense, the ECB had to act swiftly and decisively to avoid that tensions in the money market would spill-over to other markets and adversely affect the real economy. So we had to clearly convey two complementary messages. One was that the ECB was determined - from the onset of the financial crises in August 2007 - to ensure the orderly functioning of the euro area inter-bank money market by offering supplementary liquidity-providing refinancing operations or - more recently - by widening the collateral framework to facilitate the provision of liquidity to merchant banks and to engage in unlimited provision of liquidity for all our refinancing operations at a fixed rate. The other message which is fundamental was to raise the public's awareness that the exceptional interventions aimed to alleviate the tensions in the money market would not compromise the longer-term achievement of price stability in line with our definition less than 2%, but close to 2%. Let me conclude. The fundamental changes in central bank communication have helped to enhance the effectiveness, predictability and credibility of monetary policy and have notably contributed to lowering both inflation rates and volatility in the real economy. For its part, the ECB has established a practise of making its policy transparent and in setting new benchmarks in the area of central banking communication. That being said, on each occasion, a central bank has to carefully assess the relevance, clarity and timeliness of the information. Transparency is a key ingredient of an effective monetary policy. Communication is an ongoing challenge and effective communication will always be characterised by a degree of flexibility and adaptability in order to respond swiftly to a rapidly changing economic environment. Thank you very much for your attention.","['communication', 'communicate', 'communications', 'banking', 'banks']","['banking communication', 'banks communication', 'bank communication', 'central banking', 'central banks']","['central banks communication', 'central banking communication', 'communication central banks', 'central bank communication', 'banks improved communication']"
1863,r090904b_ECB,euro area,2009-09-04,"Financial stability and macro-prudential supervision: objectives, instruments and the role of the ECB",papademos,0,"Over the past two years, the financial crisis has clearly demonstrated the crucial role of central banks in safeguarding financial stability and the importance of the macro-prudential approach to regulation and supervision. As a result, in many countries or economic areas, the institutional framework for financial stability, which is being strengthened in the light of the lessons learnt from the crisis, incorporates new supervisory tasks and bodies responsible for the macro-prudential regulation of systemic risk. And central banks are envisaged to play a key role in the conduct of the macro-prudential supervision of the financial system as a whole. In the EU, following the publication of the Report of the de Larosiere Group , the European Commission proposed in May 2009 a set of ambitious reforms, including notably the creation of a new European Systemic Risk Board responsible for macro-prudential oversight. The European Council in June 2009 supported the Commission proposal . The establishment of a new framework for macro-prudential supervision in the EU has highlighted a number of fundamental issues concerning its objectives, powers and tools. And, in particular, it has raised some important questions on how the conduct of macro-prudential supervision relates to, and complements, the performance of other central banking tasks that can also contribute to financial stability. In my remarks I will address three questions: What is the nature of the relationship between price stability and financial stability? In particular, is there a possible policy trade-off for central banks between the objectives of securing price stability and safeguarding financial stability? What are the objectives, tasks and policy instruments of the envisaged framework for macro-prudential supervision in the EU? What is the role of the ECB in contributing to financial stability and the macro-prudential supervision of the EU financial system? There is broad consensus that central banks' main responsibility is to preserve price stability and that they also have an important role to play in promoting financial stability. The ECB's objectives are clearly laid out in the Treaty. The primary objective is to maintain price stability. At the same time, Article 105 (5) of the Treaty stipulates that the ECB/ESCB ""shall contribute to [...] the stability of the financial system"" . The Eurosystem's Mission Statement states that ""we aim to safeguard financial stability..."". In many cases, the financial stability mandates of central banks, and the associated tasks to be performed, are specified in relatively general terms. There are several reasons for this. One reason is the complexity of the concept of financial stability and the challenges faced in specifying the associated policy objective in explicit terms. Another reason is that the powers and policy instruments necessary for the preservation of financial stability may be shared with other authorities. At the ECB, we have defined financial stability as ""a condition in which the financial system - comprising financial intermediaries, markets and market infrastructures - is capable of withstanding shocks and the unravelling of financial imbalances in the financial intermediation process which are severe enough to significantly impair the allocation of savings to profitable investment opportunities"". It is clear from this definition that the objective of promoting and safeguarding financial stability cannot be defined in terms of a single indicator in a reasonably straightforward manner, as can be done with the price stability objective. Indeed, it has been argued that it may be preferable or more useful to define financial stability as absence of instability"" . Notwithstanding, the inherent difficulty in defining the financial stability objective with precision, a key issue for the central bank is the relationship between financial stability and price stability. Are these two conditions and the pertinent policy objectives complementary, or are there situations in which the simultaneous attainment of these two goals may pose a policy trade-off for the central bank? And, if the latter happens to be the case, does the central bank have sufficient powers and instruments to address this trade-off and achieve each objective without jeopardising the attainment of the other? Let me make a number of observations related to these questions. In general, price stability and financial stability complement and mutually reinforce one another. And, consequently, the pursuit of the pertinent policy objectives does not involve any trade-offs. Price stability contributes to financial stability in a number of ways. For example, as most financial contracts are expressed in nominal terms, an environment of stable prices prevents an arbitrary redistribution of income and wealth between borrowers and lenders that could result from unanticipated price developments and lead to financial stress and potential defaults. Moreover, monetary policy that credibly preserves price stability promotes financial stability. The benefits of the ECB's credible commitment to maintaining price stability have been demonstrated during the current financial crisis. Through the firm anchoring of inflation expectations to price stability, the ECB's monetary policy has minimised the risk of deflation. Moreover, stable inflation expectations have enhanced the effectiveness of monetary policy decisions in stabilising the economy, which is particularly relevant when nominal policy rates are very low and face a lower bound. In turn, this has contributed to financial stability, both by helping to stabilise economic activity and by reducing the potential risk of a Fisherian-type debt deflation spiral. Conversely, a stable financial system enhances the effectiveness of monetary policy in maintaining price stability in various ways, namely by facilitating the smooth transmission of monetary policy impulses, by containing the propagation and impact of macroeconomic economic shocks through the financial sector, and by reducing the incidence of shocks originating in the financial sector, from bank failures or the abrupt unwinding of sizeable imbalances in financial markets. These observations imply that in general monetary policy actions can contribute to both preserving price stability and fostering or safeguarding financial stability. This can also hold true during periods of financial stress. For example, the non-standard measures implemented by the ECB over the past two years - in particular the introduction of full allotment at fixed rates in the provision of central bank liquidity in the Eurosystem monetary market operations - have contributed to financial stability by preventing a shortage of liquidity from becoming a widespread solvency problem with adverse effects on financial and price stability and the real economy. They have also contributed to price stability by supporting the provision of credit beyond what could be achieved through the favourable impact of interest rate reductions and by ensuring that the easing of financial conditions induced by policy rate cuts would be fully transmitted to firms and households at a time when financial markets and institutions were under stress. That having been said, there can be situations when the constellation of the shocks affecting the real economy and financial markets, in particular, the impact of ""structural"" or ""behavioural"" changes related to productivity developments or market sentiment, may create trade-offs and pose challenges for central banks aiming at the simultaneous preservation of price stability and financial stability. Let me give you two examples. There can be situations in which financial imbalances emerge - with adverse consequences for future financial and price stability - in an environment of stable prices and the associated very low interest rates. And, indeed, it has been argued - and there is evidence to support this view - that an environment of very low inflation and a prolonged period of very low interest rates may be conducive to an underpricing of risk, an imprudent increase in leverage and the emergence of asset price bubbles. In such an environment, the central bank may face an inter-temporal trade off, if it aims at safeguarding financial and price stability over the longer term by tightening the monetary policy stance because of the potential impact of the tightening on shorter and medium term price developments. Another example is provided by the situation in the euro area and elsewhere during the first year of the financial market turmoil, when inflationary pressures increased because of the effects of sizeable and persisting oil and other commodity price shocks, while the pace of economic activity was decelerating and the financial system was experiencing increasing stress. In such a situation, the ECB had to ensure the preservation of price stability, by preventing the emergence of second round effects in wage and price-setting, while at the same time addressing severe money market pressures and the impact of other factors threatening the stability of the financial system. In such situations, involving possible policy trade-offs in achieving the objectives of preserving price stability and safeguarding financial stability, and when the determining factors and processes that threaten price and financial stability are not positively correlated, the central bank should be able to rely on an expanded set of policy instruments that can help achieve the two objectives simultaneously. During the first year of the financial market turmoil, the ECB addressed the unfavourable combination of, on the one hand, persisting and increasing inflation risks and, on the other, sustainable stress in the financial system and risks to its stability by using two instruments: the key monetary policy interest rate as well as liquidity provision and management. The level of the policy rate was defined so as to achieve the primary objective of preserving price stability. At the same time, the Eurosystem engaged in active liquidity management in order to mitigate pressures in the money markets and their spill-over effects on financial markets and the real economy. This was done by adjusting the inter-temporal distribution of liquidity provision within the reserve maintenance period and the maturity profile of the refinancing operations, while maintaining the overall supply of central bank money broadly unchanged. The need for an extended set of policy instruments for safeguarding financial stability is greater in order to prevent the emergence of financial imbalances and the recurrence of a financial crisis. The experience of the past few years and new evidence from research strongly suggest that monetary policy should aim at containing excessive risk-taking and unsustainable asset price developments that are often associated with persistent credit growth and rising leverage. In many circumstances, central banks can use policy interest rates to ""lean against the wind"" of financial market excesses, in a manner which is effective and consistent with the preservation of price stability over a longer term horizon. And the ECB's monetary policy strategy - with its medium term orientation and the emphasis that it places on the analysis of monetary and credit developments - is very well suited for this. At the same time, past experience has also shown that there are limits to what can be achieved by relying solely on the interest rate instrument. The presence of short term policy trade offs in an environment of very low or even falling inflation, the relative ""bluntness"" of the monetary policy tool and the often difficult situation in terms of available information and analysis, put certain limits to the use of monetary policy for financial stability purposes. Moreover, market excesses and the pro-cyclicality of the financial system are also due to factors other than excessive credit growth and high leverage. Consequently, other policy tools must be employed - notably regulatory policy instruments - by the supervisory authorities in order to reduce procyclicality and also limit the emergence of systemic risks in the financial system. This assessment is also compatible with Tinbergen's rule that, in case of trade-offs between objectives, policy makers need as many (independent) policy instruments as objectives, in order to fully achieve them. Furthermore, the extraordinary nature and consequences of the financial crisis - and here I am referring both to how close we came to a global financial meltdown and to the overall costs of the crisis for tax-payers in terms of losses in output and employment - have painfully demonstrated the need for improving and broadening the regulatory framework, by strengthening both the micro-prudential supervision of individual institutions and the macro-prudential supervision of the financial system as a whole. The current crisis has revealed a general under-appreciation of systemic risks in the existing framework of financial regulation and supervision, which tends to focus on the stability of individual institutions, markets and infrastructures. The crisis also revealed that macro-financial factors, the inter-connectedness of markets and institutions and financial globalisation play an important role in determining the size, nature and propagation of systemic risk. Therefore, it essential - and there is a broad consensus on this - to establish an effective framework for macro-prudential supervision that will ensure a systematic, all-encompassing and integrated analysis of systemic risks as well as the formulation of appropriate policies to prevent address such risks. The macro-prudential approach to supervision focuses on the financial system as a whole and involves the monitoring, assessment and mitigation of systemic risk, namely the likelihood of failure of a significant part of the financial system. It is important to recognise that systemic risk is partly endogenous as it depends on the collective behaviour of financial institutions and their inter-connectedness, as well as the interaction between financial markets and the macroeconomy. Macro-prudential policies aim to prevent, or at least contain, the build up of financial imbalances and ensure that the financial system is able to withstand their unwinding and be resilient to shocks. Central banks are well suited to be the authorities mainly responsible for macro-prudential supervision because of their expertise and analytical capabilities in the fields of monetary and financial stability analysis, as well as due to their closeness to the money and financial markets. The interlinkages between the financial system and the macroeconomy further strengthen the rationale for assigning to the central banks the responsibility for macro-prudential analysis and the formulation of recommendations concerning macro-prudential policies. What is the nature of the policy instruments of macro-prudential supervision? Macro-prudential policies will concern, to a considerable extent, regulatory and supervisory action. They could take the form of general guidelines or concrete recommendations relating to the calibration of prudential tools. For example, macro-prudential recommendations could involve the adjustment of capital requirements or the setting of additional capital buffers in the banking system as a whole, or entail guidance regarding leverage ratios and liquidity management. Macro-prudential policies would not concern individual financial institutions . While in principle a range of macro-prudential tools is available, the choice of the appropriate tools to address emerging systemic risks remains a challenge, requiring further analysis in order to identify the most efficient and effective instruments for the implementation of macro-prudential policies. Obviously, the new macro-prudential approach to regulation and supervision has to be integrated with the existing micro-prudential structures. Macro- and micro-prudential supervision are complementary components and are part of the overall financial supervisory framework. The institutional arrangements for the performance of these two tasks must ensure effective cooperation and information sharing between the institutions involved in micro- and macro-prudential supervision. Let me now focus on the envisaged macro-prudential framework in the EU and on the role of the ECB. Following the publication of the Report of the de Larosiere Group in February 2009 and the Commission Communication in May, the Ecofin Council agreed in June 2009 that a new independent body responsible for the conduct of macro-prudential oversight in the EU should be established, namely the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB). The creation of the ESRB was supported by the European Council on 18 and 19 June 2009. In the wake of these decisions, the Commission is preparing legal texts with concrete provisions concerning the establishment and functioning of the ESRB, which will be transmitted to the European Parliament and the Council in late September. These will be part of a broader package of legislative proposals including those for establishing the three new European micro-prudential supervisory authorities. The European System of Central Banks (ESCB) will play a key role in the functioning of the ESRB. The General Board of the ESRB will comprise, as voting members, the Members of the General Council of the ECB (27 governors of the national central banks, the President and the Vice-President of the ECB), the Chairpersons of the three European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) and a member of the European Commission. Representatives of the competent national supervisory authorities (one for each Member State) and the President of the Economic and Financial Committee (EFC) will also attend the meetings of the ESRB. The participation of all the members of the General Council of the ECB in the ESRB will ensure that the financial stability analysis of the ESRB will benefit from the macro-economic, financial and monetary expertise of the EU central banks. The main task of the ESRB will be to identify and assess risks to the stability of the EU financial system and issue risk warnings when the identified risks appear to be significant. When appropriate, the ESRB could complement its risk warnings with policy recommendations for remedial action. The ESRB will not be responsible for the implementation of macro-prudential policies. The final responsibility for implementing the ESRB recommendations will remain with national supervisors and other national authorities. As the ESRB will not implement macro-prudential policies, the effective monitoring of the follow-up to its warnings and recommendations and their consistent and timely implementation will be crucial for the performance and the credibility of the new macro-prudential supervisory framework. The ESRB will not perform its tasks in isolation; close cooperation with the other EU supervisory authorities will be vital for the success of the new supervisory framework. Indeed, according to the Commission Communication, the functioning of the new EU supervisory architecture requires efficient cooperation between the ESRB and the European System of Financial Supervision (ESFS), comprised of the three European Supervisory Authorities. This should ensure the appropriate interplay at the EU level between the macro- and micro-prudential levels. The ESRB is also expected to liaise with global institutions. In line with the Commission Communication, the ESRB will need to set up arrangements for close collaboration with the IMF, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and third country counterparts. This liaison with external counterparts is expected to help the ESRB identify and better assess risks stemming from outside the EU at an earlier stage than would otherwise be the case. It is evident from the envisaged activities of the ESRB that its work will be wide-ranging and complex. It is the task of the ECB to assist this new body in performing its duties. According to the Council Conclusions, the ECB will provide analytical, statistical, administrative and logistical support to the ESRB. In particular, the ECB will assist the ESRB in the development and collection of new statistical data of relevance to the ESRB on a regular basis. The ECB will also assist the ESRB by developing and maintaining new analytical tools and methodologies for the identification and assessment of systemic risks and the issuance of early risk warnings, so that the ESRB effectively performs its tasks. This task poses important challenges because the identification and assessment of systemic risks require special skills and the further development of analytical tools. Models must be developed to help structure and analyse the vast amount of information collected for the risk assessment. Each model has its pros and cons, and serves different purposes. As financial stability and macro-prudential analyses are less developed than those in other policy areas, it is advisable to employ a multiplicity of approaches. In conclusion, I would like to stress four points: First, the ECB tasks related to its contribution to safeguarding financial stability are compatible with its monetary policy framework for achieving its primary objective of price stability. Indeed, the ECB's monetary policy strategy is very well suited for the potential use of the interest rate instrument in order to ""lean against the wind"" of financial market excesses, in a manner consistent with the preservation of price stability over the medium and longer term. Second, the establishment of the ESRB and the attribution of macro-prudential tasks to the ECB will strengthen the ECB's capacity (its power and means) to contribute to financial stability, without interfering with the performance of its monetary policy tasks. Third, the new body responsible for macro-prudential supervision in the EU should be independent in carrying out its tasks and pursuing its objective of assessing and regulating systemic risk. The fact that the ESRB will be responsible for the assessment of systemic risks and the formulation of pertinent policy recommendations, and that it will not be involved in the implementation of these recommendations strengthens the argument for its policy independence. Fourth, the effective performance of macro-prudential supervision in the EU will require addressing a number of legal, institutional and governance issues. There are two key requirements for the successful functioning of the ESRB: The first is the establishment of a comprehensive and relevant information base as well as effective information-sharing and cooperation between the ESRB and the European Supervisory Authorities. The second is that suitable and sufficient mechanisms are in place in order to ensure the implementation of the macro-prudential recommendations. Finally, I should emphasise that the ECB is actively preparing, in collaboration with the national central banks, in order to provide the appropriate analytical statistical and administrative support to the ESRB.","['banking', 'regulatory', 'regulation', 'banks', 'supervisory']","['eu supervisory', 'european supervisory', 'financial supervisory', 'oversight eu', 'prudential supervisory']","['prudential supervision eu', 'european financial supervision', 'prudential oversight eu', 'macro prudential supervisory', 'prudential oversight european']"
1998,r101025b_ECB,euro area,2010-10-25,Household Finance and Consumption - Opening remarks,no_info,0,"It is a great pleasure to open this joint BCL/ECB conference in Luxembourg. This is the second conference organised in the context of the Eurosystem Household Finance and Consumption Network. This network is unique as it brings together experts from a wide range of fields and institutions in one single forum. Participants in today's meeting include survey experts, statisticians and economists. Institutions represented are the ECB, the Eurosystem's national central banks and a number of national statistical institutes and research institutes, as well as central banks from outside the Eurosystem. Developing, implementing and analysing a survey on the finances and consumption of households for the entire euro area does not happen overnight. The history of this network dates back to December 2006. A task force was then established to investigate the feasibility of a survey on household finance and consumption in the euro area. On the basis of the task force's report, the Governing Council decided to establish a network of Eurosystem experts to prepare a proposal for such a survey. For one and a half years the network worked diligently at developing such a proposal. Based on this proposal, in September 2008 the Governing Council approved the conduct of the survey and gave a three-fold mandate to the network: (1) to complete the implementation work, (2) to take care of the survey development and (3) to serve as a forum for research with the survey data. After all this preparatory work, the fieldwork of actual data collection of the first wave of the Household Finance and Consumption Survey could finally start, with many countries in the euro area conducting their survey in the course of 2010 and 2011. At the current juncture, we are therefore looking forward to the analysis that will result of using the collected data. Even though the data of the first wave of the euro area wide survey are not yet available today, there is already a large literature on household finance that analyses existing micro household data. The work that will be presented at this conference shows this very clearly, with contributions based on a wide array of datasets ranging from existing public household surveys to private datasets from credit card companies. The Household Finance and Consumption Network is a good example of what is possible when the Eurosystem co-ordinates its efforts as a team. Central banks around the world have either collected household data or supported the collection of such data by other institutions for a long time. The strength of the network is that it has been able to tap into that valuable expertise from many sources. Household surveys on wealth date back to 1962 when the US Board of Governors' Survey of Consumer Finances started as the Survey of Financial Characteristics of Consumers. Not long thereafter, in 1965, the Bank of Italy started its Survey of Household Income and Wealth. Those two pioneers, as I may call them, were followed later by national statistical institutes and Eurosystem central banks. In the eighties, INSEE started its Enquete Patrimoine and Statistics Finland its Survey of Household Wealth. In 1994 a survey of Portuguese households' wealth and debt was conducted by the National Statistical Office in Portugal, encouraged by the Banco de Portugal. In 1999 the first Cyprus Survey of Consumer Finances was launched as a joint project between the University of Cyprus and the Central Bank of Cyprus. In 2002, the Bank of Spain started its Survey of Household Finances. In the same year Greece launched its survey of household debt and the Netherlands Bank began participating in what was formerly known as the CentER Savings Survey, a survey running since 1993, and currently known as the Household Survey of De Nederlandsche Bank. Throughout the work of the network, experts from these existing surveys have given their valuable advice. Allow me to especially mention today's keynote speaker, Arthur Kennickell from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. As the Chief of the Microeconomic Surveys Section he is ""the"" expert of the US Survey of Consumer Finances with a long and deep experience in this field. He has put a relentless effort in providing the most valuable advice to the network. Through the years, the network has also drawn on the expertise of academics who have provided invaluable advice and guidance throughout. Some are present at the conference, such as Michalis Haliassos of Frankfurt University who has been involved since the beginning of the project, and Peter Tufano of Harvard Business School, who volunteered to be part of the scientific committee of this conference. Tomorrow, you will listen to an expert on financial literary: Annamaria Lusardi of Dartmouth College will give a keynote lecture on how financial literacy affects economic decisions of households. Once the data of the Eurosystem Household Finance and Consumption Survey are available, they will provide a wealth of comparable information on micro-level household decisions with regard to the holding of real and financial assets, the taking of debt, employment, income, pensions, intergenerational transfers, gifts, consumption and saving, and risk attitudes. Anonymised euro area micro data will be made available to the wider research community. To understand better the reasons for a conference on household finance, it is worth elaborating on why central banks get involved in the development and production of micro-level data. Fundamentally, micro-level household data provide information that is not available from national accounts or flow of funds data. Central bank policymakers expand their knowledge if they complement information from macro aggregates with micro-insights. Micro-insights are a natural counterpart of the macro models used in monetary policy that are traditionally based on analyses of the aggregates such as GDP, consumption and investment. But how precisely can micro level data serve the purpose of central banking? It seems to me that there are multiple answers to this question. I will stress here three. , the reaction functions of various categories of agents that are built into macro models have to be ultimately based on micro-level analysis. , the micro-level data provide us with a wealth of distributional information, information that is not available from the macro aggregates and that is valuable to understand the reaction of different groups of households to shocks and the distribution of risks. , micro-level household data can give insights into new trends. Let me first express in more detail what we can learn about the reaction functions of households from micro data. Household survey data link information on income, assets, debt and consumption at the household level. To understand consumption and saving behaviour of households, it is crucial to combine these various elements in the analysis. Households respond in a quite heterogeneous way to shocks depending, among many other factors, on the form their wealth takes. For instance, wealth can be very illiquid when it is concentrated in home ownership, thus affecting households' possibilities for adapting their consumption behaviour to various shocks. Understanding how consumption is affected by changes in either stock market prices or house prices is relevant for policymakers. Especially during times of big shocks, such as a financial or economic crisis, policymakers are interested in understanding how the fluctuations in assets prices will affect aggregate demand. During these times, knowledge provided by the surveys comes at a premium. In particular, the way household spending reacts to changes in interest rates is of continuing relevance for monetary policy, not only during crisis periods. Important elements of this reaction are the demand for housing and the different homeownership ratios across euro-area countries. Residential investment is an important channel through which interest rates changes are transmitted via households through the economy. As purchase of a house is often financed with a mortgage, understanding the access of households to mortgage credit increases our understanding of the transmission of interest rate changes to credit demand. Central banks regularly monitor the evolution of credit aggregates. Mortgages make up the bulk of household liabilities and are an important element of total credit. Two interesting puzzles in this context are: (1) the origins of the enormous diversity of home-ownership levels, and (2) the large differences in mortgage types that we see across the countries of the euro area. In some countries, with Germany and France as examples, households tend to hold fixed rate mortgages, whereas in other countries, such as Spain and Portugal, households typically hold adjustable rate mortgages. Despite big advances in the integration of financial markets in the euro area, differences in the fixation of mortgage rates seem to persist. Micro household data can shed light on the origins of these differences, namely whether these are caused by household characteristics, institutions, government policies or just different tastes. Understanding these differences is important because the way the assets and liabilities of households are structured has implications for their relative sensitivity to market interest rates and, ultimately, for the transmission of monetary policy. For instance, the transmission of interest rate shocks is likely to be stronger and more immediate in countries with adjustable-rate mortgages. Household survey data are not only useful to estimate more precisely the behaviour of households with respect to spending, saving and credit, it also provides unique information on the distribution of assets and liabilities. Distribution of assets and liabilities across households and possible mismatches between assets and liabilities of individual households affect the transmission of monetary policy to macro aggregates: different distributions of wealth will generally lead to different aggregate fluctuations in the macro aggregates in reaction to shocks. This brings me to the second reason for the usefulness of micro data. The distribution of assets and liabilities has an effect on how risks are distributed across different household subpopulations. In that respect, policy makers cannot be content to just rely on aggregate numbers. Aggregate statistics on the indebtedness of households can be misleading if debt is concentrated among some household groups. For instance, it poses fewer risks if it is concentrated mainly among the relatively wealthy households. In this regard, it is equally important to understand how households choose their portfolios: the risks stemming from the household sector will depend largely on how household portfolios are structured. Household portfolios are prone to all sorts of biases. The home bias in equity holdings is a well-known example. Well-functioning financial markets are a prerequisite for a well-functioning monetary transmission. Important topics for further analyses are: what influences households in their choices of assets? What role do financial intermediaries such as banks play? What determines the risk-taking behaviour of households and what are its implications for financial stability? In the European Union we are currently in the process of setting up the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), a new body responsible for the macro-prudential oversight of the financial system. It is clear that macro-prudential risks may stem not only from the balance sheets of banks or other financial intermediaries, but also from the balance sheets of households. The aggregated data of the household sector are not always sufficient to understand the magnitude and the location of these risks: they need to be complemented by distributional information. I therefore foresee that the household survey on finance and consumption will also be an important source of information for the ESRB, in spite of its low frequency, especially if it can be enhanced to encompass the entire EU. My third point is that survey data are also useful to monitor new important developments. The relationship between aging, pension provision and consumption is a field of research that will become more important as European populations grow older. As of this day, many countries faced with the budgetary consequences of an aging population have already embarked on policy changes in pension provision. Retirement ages are being increased and pension entitlements have changed. The micro survey data can shed light on the saving behaviour of the households when they are faced with these changes. New developments will also come from financial innovation. As households are faced with new types of assets to invest in, or with new types of debt, these innovations will have an effect on consumption smoothing. New types of debt, for instance, may reduce the importance of borrowing constraints and could therefore have financial stability implications and change households' reaction to shocks. I am happy to see that all three elements I just discussed are present in this conference. For instance, in your first session today you will be discussing how stock market participation depends on financial advice. In your second session, you will discuss how consumption reacts to mortgage interest rates. Tomorrow, you will go deeper into issues of inheritance, household wealth and borrowing. I hope I was able to convince you that what you will be discussing in these two days is not only of purely academic interest, but also of importance for us policymakers. I wish you a fruitful conference and I look forward to your presentations and discussions.

2006,r101119c_ECB,euro area,2010-11-19,In search of a robust monetary policy framework,stark,0,"I am very pleased to open the second day of the ECB Central Banking Conference. We witnessed very interesting presentations and discussions yesterday, and today's programme promises to be no less stimulating. In my remarks I would like to offer some reflections on what I consider to be the desirable features of a robust monetary policy framework. Only three years ago, it was widely believed that this issue had been settled once and for all. At that time, several studies outlined the then prevailing consensus view on monetary policy. This view emphasised, among other things: central bank independence; price stability as the primary objective of central banks; and the importance of transparent communication for the solid anchoring of long-term inflation expectations. But the consensus also emphasised four elements to which the ECB has never subscribed, namely: the targeting of inflation at a relatively short and fixed horizon; the assignment of a primary role to monetary policy in the management of aggregate demand in the short term; the systematic disregard of money and credit indicators in the conduct of monetary policy; and the asymmetric reaction to asset price bubbles as opposed to busts; the latter often referred to as the ""cleaning-up strategy"" in the context of the ""Jackson Hole consensus"". This framework has been severely tested during the financial crisis and perhaps, to some extent, damaged. Moreover, the crisis has exposed the fact that, on some crucial questions, the consensus view, as expressed in these studies, is in need of revision. Certainly, some aspects of the framework will, in my view, to survive the crisis. The first aspect is central bank independence and, at least in the EU context, the prohibition of government debt monetisation. The second aspect is the centrality of price stability for monetary policy. And the third aspect is the importance of transparent communication. The crisis has not at all discredited these three principles. Together they have formed, and I believe will continue to form, the basis for central banks' credibility and efficiency in contributing to the economic welfare of nations. International convergence on these principles has, however, been a slow process. After the collapse of the Bretton Woods system there was a long period of confusion created by the loss of a nominal anchor, which, during the system's good times, had been provided by the US commitment to peg its currency to the price of gold. In the 1970s even some central bankers were sceptical that monetary policy alone could control inflation. Failed attempts to fine-tune the economy and the associated stop-and-go policies resulted in stagflation in a vast portion of the industrialised world. Drawing lessons from this experience, and inspired by monetarist views that had successfully influenced monetary policy in Germany and Switzerland, central banks in the 1980s gained confidence in their ability to bring inflation down to levels consistent with price stability at a modest cost to the economy at large. The 1990s were characterised by the development of monetary policy frameworks capable of perpetuating the achieved degree of price stability. In my view, two major initiatives stand out: first, the development of inflation targeting. Inflation targeting developed in many countries when other strategies failed to bring about the desired level of price and macroeconomic stability. Some countries turned to inflation targeting because the instability of money demand in the face of ongoing financial innovation appeared to render the application of textbook-type versions of monetary targeting unappealing. Even so, inflation targeting was heavily influenced by the monetarist view that monetary policy can control inflation. The second development was the establishment of the ECB, with its two-pillar monetary policy strategy. Inflation targeting and the ECB's strategy share important features: the insistence on central bank independence, the priority assigned to the price stability objective, and the importance of transparent communication. These three principles are fundamental to sound monetary policy. Nevertheless, for various reasons, the ECB does not view itself as an inflation-targeting central bank, at least not in the way inflation targeting is commonly described. One reason relates to our definition of price stability and our specification of the policy horizon. Another reason relates to the special role our monetary policy strategy assigns to money and credit. Both aspects differ markedly from textbook inflation targeting. But I should also add that the ECB's monetary pillar builds on the tradition developed by the most successful central banks prior to the introduction of the euro - a tradition which precedes the advent of inflation targeting, in some cases by decades. Let me adopt a stylised incarnation of a flexible inflation-targeting regime, a description which, nonetheless, follows closely early expositions in the literature. Inflation targeting has evolved, as we all know, both in theoretical work and in the practice of the inflation-targeting central banks. However, it might still be useful to identify elements in the regime - as it was originally conceived - which have influenced the conduct of monetary policy in the years immediately prior to the crisis more profoundly than was perhaps ideal. I will concentrate on two specific features, the implied short-termism in terms of excessive focus on aggregate demand management, on the one hand, and the systematic disregard of monetary phenomena, on the other, which in my view are essential ingredients for understanding the genesis of the crisis. A key lesson from the current crisis is that, going forward, any monetary policy framework that lays claim to being ""robust"" will have to satisfy the following two requirements - beyond the uncontroversial principles I mentioned earlier: first, the monetary policy strategy needs to be geared towards the medium term to resist the fine-tuning temptation; and second, the strategy needs to assign a prominent role to developments in money and credit which - as the crisis has shown convincingly - provide reliable signals of risks to long-term price stability, financial stability and overall macroeconomic stability. In my view, these two requirements are natural complements. The key role of money, both before and during the crisis, has been to maintain a focus on developments in nominal trends at lower frequencies. In this context let me elaborate the case for monetary policy strategies oriented towards the medium term. You may ask ""but isn't this exactly what central banks around the world have been pursuing for the past two decades?"" Well, perhaps or perhaps not. Five years ago, at the Jackson Hole conference, for example, former Fed Vice Chairman Alan Blinder described US monetary policy since the late 1980s in terms of the ""resurrection of fine-tuning"". Moreover, flexible inflation targeting, with its added focus on output stabilisation beyond inflation stabilisation is at risk of succumbing to the temptation of fine-tuning. An element of the so-called ""Jackson Hole consensus"" was that monetary policy should play a key role in the management of aggregate demand in the short term, whereas fiscal policy was viewed as an inappropriate instrument, mainly because of decision and implementation lags embedded in the policy process. I would argue that we should not overestimate the potency of either policy. Before the crisis there was a common misperception that monetary policy could focus more on demand management because inflation was durably under control. Proponents of this view found apparent vindication in the phenomenon of the ""great moderation"" observed in the 20 years before the crisis. However, there were clear warnings that the short-term orientation could have negative side effects in the medium to long term. As we now know, the side effects manifested themselves in a spectacular build-up of monetary and financial imbalances. The sudden unwinding of these imbalances marked the beginning of the current crisis. Although monetary policy frameworks oriented more towards the medium term could probably not have completely prevented the current crisis, I am convinced that they would have helped to make it less disruptive. The then dominant theoretical framework suggested otherwise. The New Keynesian model generated policy prescriptions which assigned the central bank the task of stabilising inflation and output developments at short horizons and in quite precise terms. These prescriptions have shaped the inflation-targeting policy advice to a non-negligible extent. Let me emphasise, though, that many inflation-targeting central banks retain a considerable degree of flexibility when putting this advice into practice - although in a very different way from the meaning the term ""flexibility"" has received in theoretical work. I will return to this point shortly. Simplifying, the inflation-targeting policy advice can be articulated in three main precepts: First, look at inflation forecasts and output gap forecasts as summary statistics of the state of the economy. Second, rely on your best model of the economy, even if it does not integrate or just assigns a trivial role to a host of variables, particularly money and credit, which are assumed to adjust to the state of the economy. Third, follow the best policy implied by the model and set the policy instrument so that inflation forecasts - whatever the nature of the shocks that might have caused them - are stabilised, and output volatility is minimised, at a pre-set horizon. Now, it is easy to imagine economic conditions in which these prescriptions induce destabilising behaviour on the side of monetary policy, which is the exact opposite of what monetary policy should do. Limiting the information set to inflation forecasts and output gap forecasts can be highly misleading. One of the reasons for this has been known for a long time: output gaps cannot be observed in real time. An imperfectly understood concept - which, in addition, is statistically very imprecisely measured and subject to frequent revisions - is not a safe indicator to choose as a guide for policy. Indeed, the great policy failures of the 1970s have been traced to policy-makers' exaggerated real-time measures of economic slack. Another reason which argues against limiting the policy-makers' information set is that the same inflation forecast can result from very different combinations of economic shocks. In other words, inflation forecasts are summary statistics of the state of the economy: you have to look at the underlying shocks in order to interpret inflation. This is far less appreciated, but it is one of the economic foundations of the ECB's monetary policy strategy. A fundamental principle of our strategy is that different underlying shocks - although potentially leading to the same inflation forecast - can have vastly different implications for policy. Failing to recognise that a prudent policy stance is always conditional on the shocks that hit the economy, and that accordingly the policy-relevant horizon varies with those shocks, would not comply with the requirements of a medium-term orientation and, in addition, would be extremely hazardous. Let me give you an example. Think of a benign disinflation caused by positive supply-side shocks. Positive supply-side shocks tend to produce lower inflation and high output growth at the same time. The attempt to stabilise inflation at a certain horizon - and thus resist disinflation - can, in those circumstances, introduce pro-cyclicality in monetary policy. A central bank that is instructed to stabilise inflation at a pre-set horizon in those circumstances can well end up providing too much accommodation, precisely at a time when output and incomes are growing robustly and asset markets are most prone to exuberance. Think of the protracted period of productivity growth and negative price surprises associated with technological innovation and globalisation that we saw over the second half of the 1990s. If you combine that scenario with systematic resistance to disinflation, and systematic neglect of monetary phenomena, you can lay the ground for financial instability down the road. As I said, central banks describing themselves as inflation targeters have realised that, in practice, one needs to go beyond the standard inflation-targeting policy advice emanating from the New-Keynesian framework. Referring back to my example, my feeling is that the central bank community is increasingly sharing the view that - in the face of positive supply-side shocks - one should accept in the short run inflation somewhat lower than the inflation objective so as to avoid the risks involved in potentially large deviations from target at longer horizons. This view is perfectly consistent with the ECB's view of the medium term, also in the sense of not trying to manage aggregate demand. It points to the advantages of limiting the central bank's mandate to the maintenance of price stability over the medium term without any reference to aggregate demand management. However, it immediately raises the question of how to enshrine this view into a monetary policy strategy. For inflation-targeting central banks, embedding this view appears to be achieved by extending the forecast horizon and by applying judgement. In contrast, the ECB's monetary analysis can be seen as a formalisation of the view that the policy horizon should be commensurate with the nature and size of shocks, rather than being determined by a particular set of inflation forecasts. This leads me to my second topic, the case for correcting the systematic disregard of monetary phenomena in the consensus framework. As I have stressed before, in my view, monetary policy should avoid any kind of short-termism. The necessary medium-term orientation of monetary policy calls for the use of tools and indicators that have a comparative advantage over such a horizon. At the same time, it is an undisputed fact in academic and central banking circles that prolonged periods of high inflation are associated with high money growth. On both theoretical and empirical grounds, the ultimately monetary nature of inflation cannot be challenged. While other factors can influence price developments at shorter horizons, this does not call into question the underlying long-term relationship between money and prices. Furthermore, the empirical evidence clearly points to monetary trends inflationary trends, thus giving support for a monetary analysis in a forward-looking monetary policy. The analysis of monetary aggregates allows the ECB to identify the longer-term and more persistent trends in inflation. This is the main reason for the monetary pillar in our monetary policy framework. The monetary pillar should not be confused with a ""financial stability pillar"". Monetary analysis is not conducted with the principal goal of detecting financial imbalances. It ultimately rests on the quantity-theoretic notion of there being a reliable link between money and price developments. Exploring the link between money and asset prices should be seen as a complementary way of better understanding the role of money. A number of recent studies have demonstrated, in a quite impressive way, that monetary developments - especially when seen in conjunction with credit developments - can also alert policy-makers to unwarranted financial developments and imbalances. Needless to say, the financial crisis we have experienced has, in my view, clearly demonstrated the need for policy-makers to have such reliable early warning signals at their disposal. While some parts of the academic literature have long held the view that identifying a bubble in real time is an impossible task, the academic literature on early warning indicator models has made significant progress over the past ten years. Research carried out within the BIS and the ECB have illustrated that - among other variables, such as price-earnings ratios or price-dividend ratios - simple deviations of money and credit aggregates from a trend that exceed a given threshold are among the few early indicators for (potentially costly) boom and bust periods. And one key property that strikes me as being of particular interest for policy-makers is the fact that these warning signals emerge well before the alarm bells of standard conjunctural analysis start ringing. The financial crisis and its subsequent shockwaves have also led to recommendations for greater importance to be placed on an approach of ""leaning against the wind"". According to this approach, monetary policy should be conducted in a ""symmetric"" manner over the financial cycle. More precisely, monetary policy should be more accommodative in times of falling asset prices, but less accommodative during a financial market boom. For instance, the central bank should conduct a slightly tighter monetary policy than warranted by its price stability objective, when the build-up of a potentially detrimental asset price boom has been identified. In so doing, the central bank would better ensure price stability over extended horizons and - at the same time - contain the future growth of the bubble. Such an approach can be compared to ""buying insurance"" against the risk of a harmful asset boom-bust cycle, with its potential costs in terms of macroeconomic and financial stability. Traditionally, however, there has been a great deal of scepticism about ""leaning against the wind"" for at least four reasons. First, it has been argued that it is not evident that asset price boom-bust cycles are necessarily a bad thing for real long-term growth in all countries. The benefits from the realisation of additional investment projects could, on average, outweigh the costs incurred during the bust phases. Second, as I have already mentioned, it is considered very difficult to identify an asset price bubble in real time. In particular, a tight policy response to asset price increases may end up destabilising the economy unnecessarily if the asset price valuation is driven by fundamentals. Third, it has been claimed that the policy interest rate is ""too blunt a tool"" to contain potential bubbles. Raising policy rates will depress the prices of many assets - including those not booming - as well as the real economy and consumer prices. Furthermore, in times of market euphoria, the policy rate might have to be raised quite significantly in order to have a measurable effect on booming asset prices. When taken seriously, these considerations lead to doubts about the effectiveness and efficiency of an active ""leaning against the wind"" approach. A fourth argument basically refers to cost-benefit considerations. In essence, the argument postulates that the costs of ""cleaning up afterwards"" (namely by loosening the monetary policy stance after the bust) are smaller than the ""collateral damage"" of a leaning against the wind approach pursued during the boom. These considerations describe the so-called ""cleaning-up strategy"" I mentioned earlier. In essence, these arguments all reflect valid concerns and cannot be easily dismissed. More recently, however, a number of arguments have given reason for a tempering of the concerns I have just expressed and have lent support to a ""leaning against the wind"" approach to asset price bubbles. First of all, with regard to the welfare implications of ""leaning against the wind"", the analysis of the costs of boom/bust cycles in asset prices in developed economies has been deepened and refined. Existing theoretical models use fairly specific assumptions to allow for bubbles in general equilibrium, and tend to neglect important aspects which make bubbles costly in the real world. Admittedly, not all boom/bust cycles are detrimental and have significant real effects. This is also one of the reasons why the mechanical targeting of asset prices is not a sensible option for monetary policy. However, the experience of the recent financial crisis - which has been accompanied by sharp declines in global economic activity and increasing unemployment in advanced economies - is a vivid reminder that there are boom/bust cycles which have the potential to trigger systemic crises and thus constitute a serious threat to world economic growth. Furthermore, as regards the scepticism on the effectiveness of monetary policy in containing asset price bubbles, recent research has detected some additional monetary policy transmission channels that, in essence, relate to the risk-taking behaviour of banks, the signalling effects of monetary policy and the breaking of herding behaviour. Taken together, the results then point towards the fact that each of these channels can reasonably be expected to amplify the impact of monetary policy during boom periods. For instance, the ""risk-taking"" channel suggests that banks' attitudes towards risk are strongly correlated with the monetary policy stance. In the presence of very considerable intra-financial sector leverage, even relatively modest increases in policy rates can lead to significant changes in credit conditions and market dynamics, to the extent that they alter financial institutions' risk tolerance. Similarly, mechanisms that operate through the signalling effects of monetary policy or the role potentially played by central banks in discouraging herding behaviour by investors can result in policy rate changes exerting more pronounced effects on asset prices than was typically thought to be the case in the past. Regarding the appropriate policy reaction to the build-up of financial imbalances, there seems to be broad agreement that monetary policy would hardly be the first best line of defence against, for example, systemic risk associated with asset markets, let alone asset price bubbles detected in specific market segments. This task would rather fall to regulatory and supervisory policies. But if bubble-like behaviour becomes more widespread and reflected in imbalances in money and credit developments, it becomes a concern for monetary policy too. If the past is of any guidance for the future, monetary policy needs to support regulatory and supervisory policies on two accounts. First, by making sure that the very short-term, risk-free price of credit - which the central bank controls - does not become a pro-cyclical source of volatility. And second, by intervening in a timely manner, both before asset price booms develop and when the bust of a bubble impacts the economy. Indeed, regulatory and supervisory policies lag behind innovation-driven financial market developments, and sometimes they tend to be implemented too cautiously or too slowly. In this context, it is worth keeping in mind that asset prices by no means constitute the end point of the monetary policy transmission process. There are a variety of mechanisms - among them wealth and confidence effects - through which higher asset prices have an impact on business cycle developments and may eventually result in higher consumer prices. As the financial crisis illustrates, the macroeconomic costs of financial instability and the challenges that it poses for the maintenance of price stability provide support to the case for a flexible and cautious strategy encompassing the need, in some well chosen circumstances, to influence financial markets. But how can such a policy be made operational? And if it can, can it really be implemented in practice? The answer to these questions very much depends on the monetary policy framework specifically adopted by a central bank. In this respect, the ECB's monetary policy strategy embodies elements that - in my view - provide a suitable and robust framework for an occasional, but appropriate ""leaning-against-the-wind"" approach. The ECB's Governing Council has defined its aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to 2% over the medium term. The medium-term anchoring of inflation expectations allows the conduct of a less accommodative monetary policy during a period of buoyant financial markets, even in an environment of relatively subdued inflationary pressures. While this will result in lower inflation over shorter horizons, one could expect it to be more effective in maintaining price stability over longer horizons by helping to prevent the emergence of possible deflationary risks after the bursting of the bubble. Taken together, I tend to regard the ECB's monetary policy strategy as being particularly well equipped to deal with risks to price stability across different time horizons insofar as they arise from imbalances in money and credit. It is fair to say that there have been times when the ECB's monetary policy strategy has not been well understood in some academic circles. In my view, there is only one way of addressing these concerns in a constructive way: the ECB needs to foster the public's understanding of its monetary policy strategy and, thereby, especially the robustness of monetary analysis. In spring 2007 the Governing Council endorsed the pursuit of an agenda to enhance the ECB's monetary analysis. Having faced excessive money growth, we then perceived serious challenges. We have made significant progress on our agenda. The results look promising and they will hopefully stimulate the debate further. To this end we have published a book on ""Enhancing Monetary Analysis"". Copies of this book will be made available outside the room during the break. Of course, the book should not be seen as the final word. While it has interesting answers to offer regarding some questions, other questions and challenges have arisen during the process of compiling the material. But I am confident that the new generation of tools presented in the book and the results of the subsequent debate will help us to prevent a crisis of the magnitude seen in the recent past in future decades. Let me conclude by summarising what are - in my view - the main features of a robust monetary policy framework. First, there is broad agreement that central bank independence, price stability and transparent communication will remain key features of effective and credible monetary policy-making. Second, in the case of the ECB, a quantitative definition of price stability, a medium-term orientation and a broad analytical framework, with money and credit playing an important role, have been key elements in the conduct of monetary policy. The crisis seems to be paving the way for solidifying support for the medium-term orientation and for the role of money and credit in a central bank's analysis. Third, in relation to this, the crisis seems to point towards a need for a symmetric approach in central banks' reaction to asset price bubbles and busts. Traditionally, the proposal of ""leaning against the wind"" has faced a considerable degree of scepticism. Recent results, however, call for a fair reassessment that does more justice to the advantages of such an approach. I am confident that these features of a robust monetary policy framework will guide us in the future. At the same time, I am convinced that central bankers have a responsibility to ensure that their monetary policy frameworks create the proper incentives for the banking community to assume its responsibilities and take the appropriate decisions in a timely manner to shape a healthy banking sector at the service of the real economy. , paper presented in the session ""Convergence in Macroeconomics?"" at the annual meeting of the American Economic Association on 4 January 2008.","['inflationary', 'inflation', 'macroeconomics', 'macroeconomic', 'ecb']","['monetary policy', 'ecb monetary', 'consensus monetary', 'robust monetary', 'robustness monetary']","['ecb monetary policy', 'inflation targeting ecb', 'consensus monetary policy', 'monetary policy frameworks', 'robust monetary policy']"
2175,r120709a_ECB,euro area,2012-07-09,Hearing at the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament,draghi,1,"Honourable members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, It is a pleasure to be back here in Parliament and in front of your Committee for our regular exchange of views. Today, I will explain the decisions of the Governing Council of the ECB last week. I will then consider the actions taken by central banks around the world in response to the crisis. I will also discuss the economic adjustment programmes in euro area member countries, and close with some remarks on the longer term vision for EMU. Last Thursday, the ECB's Governing Council unanimously decided to lower key interest rates by 25 basis points. This has brought the main refinancing rate to 0.75% and the deposit rate to zero. The policy decision took account of further dampening of inflationary pressures, as some of the previously identified downside risks to economic activity materialised. On non-standard monetary policy measures, the Governing Council decided in June to continue conducting all refinancing operations as fixed-rate tender procedures with full allotment, at least until mid-January 2013. Measures were also taken to improve access of the banking sector to these operations by enhancing collateral availability. Our measures, both standard and non-standard, support the transmission of monetary policy and the provision of credit to the real economy. They safeguard price stability in the euro area. And they help to reduce financing costs, supporting renewed confidence and sustainable growth. The ECB remains committed to delivering on its mandate - and retains full capacity to act in a firm and timely manner. Indicators for the second quarter of 2012 point to a weakening of growth and heightened uncertainty. But looking ahead, we continue to expect the euro area economy to recover gradually, albeit with dampened momentum. Euro area annual inflation was 2.4% in June 2012, unchanged from May. Inflation should decline in the course of 2012 and be below 2% in 2013. In an environment of modest growth and well-anchored inflation expectations, underlying price pressures should remain moderate. This will restore purchasing power of wages and salaries. Risks to this outlook are broadly balanced over the medium term: on the downside, they relate to weaker than expected euro area growth; on the upside, risks could stem from further increases in indirect taxes and higher than expected energy prices. Our monetary analysis gives a picture consistent with price stability over the medium term. In particular, the underlying pace of monetary expansion remains subdued. Weak loan growth largely reflects the current cyclical situation, heightened risk aversion and balance sheet adjustments by households and firms, which weigh on credit demand. Let me now turn to the first topic you asked me to address, the measures taken by central banks around the world in response to the global financial crisis. In a nutshell, I consider those actions to have been bold, forward-looking yet historically informed, drawing appropriate lessons from financial crises of the 20th century. Central banks have cooperated very closely during the crisis: through an important coordinated interest rate cut in October 2008; provision of swap lines; continuous information exchange; and overall actions that have been mutually consistent. In particular, the overriding objective of medium-term price stability has never been lost from sight. Both interest rate policy and non-standard measures have taken account of the prevailing specific circumstances: first, the financial and economic structure of each economy; second, the magnitude and specificity of shocks; third, the different operational frameworks of different central banks; and fourth, the different institutional settings in which they operate. For these four reasons, comparisons across constituencies have their limits. What's more, comparison of the size of central banks' balance sheets may give a distorted picture of the extent of policy action. For example, in the Eurosystem, a significant part of the balance sheet is not related to monetary policy but to gold and foreign exchange reserves. Therefore, the appropriate way to measure a central bank's actions is to do so in its own institutional and economic setting and against its own objectives. For the ECB, those actions have been, and will continue to be, geared towards maintaining price stability in the euro area. This is our mandate, and our track record speaks for itself. Effective crisis resolution needs bold actions by central banks but it also needs bold actions by other policy actors, notably governments. This brings me to the other topic that you proposed: economic adjustment programmes and the role of the ECB. In the aftermath of the crisis, a number of EU and euro area countries have requested financial assistance because of their challenged access to capital markets. At the same time, they have committed to implementing the reforms necessary to secure full market access in the future. Since financial assistance can only be temporary, the quality of the reforms and their implementation are absolutely essential. It is this quality that ultimately determines the success of a programme. The design and monitoring of programmes in the euro area is done jointly by the European Commission, the ECB and the IMF. The ECB provides input through its expertise, not least with respect to the financial sector but also with regard to country surveillance. Our experience with this set-up has been very good, and the cooperation with the Commission and the IMF has been excellent. Today's economic environment obliges all countries to take a very critical look at their past - and it obliges all to take a very objective view of their future. It is only against the background of the past that the adjustment programmes currently underway in several euro area countries can be understood. It was past economic developments and policies that led to excessive imbalances in a number of countries. And it was those imbalances - fiscal, macroeconomic and external - that were neither healthy nor sustainable. Unsustainable imbalances provide the objective need for adjustment programmes - and the degree of the adjustment is directly related to the extent to which past policies were misguided. Policy adjustment in the euro area takes place under market pressures, but less so than for countries outside the euro area because being part of monetary union shelters countries against some pressures, notably on the exchange rate. But this does not mean that the degree of policy adjustment can be lower. The schedule of regaining full market access within a few years applies here too. Therefore, perseverance in bold and necessary reforms is crucial. A critical success factor is ownership of the programmes by governments, parliaments and ultimately the citizens of the countries concerned. An essential precondition for ownership is that policy-makers communicate clearly about the economic rationale for adjustment. As I have suggested, this means taking a critical view of the past and an objective view of the future. This process has started. Increasingly, national policy-makers make the case for reform strongly. They point to past developments in explaining the background of adjustment and now highlight the many beneficial elements of reforms. Some of these reforms improve fairness by combating tax evasion or rent-seeking by vested interests, and they improve the efficiency of the public sector. National policy-makers are now increasingly making a central part of their objective the overall aim of EMU: to sustain economic well-being in the absence of major imbalances, and to generate sustainable growth in a competitive environment. In my view, a great deal of progress is underway in this respect. For example, the Irish authorities have maintained a strong track record for maintaining reform momentum throughout their programme. They have also taken important steps towards restoring the stability of the financial system. In Portugal, programme implementation remains good and important progress has been made in such areas as the labour market, the housing market, the general competition framework, the judicial system and the transport sector. The Portuguese authorities remain fully committed to achieving this year's fiscal target. The Spanish authorities too have shown that they remain fully committed to accelerating the structural reform agenda and putting the financial sector on a sound footing. They are also committed to improving external competitiveness to lay the foundations for more sustainable prosperity. Even without programmes, many policy-makers are bold in reform. In Italy, for example, reforms to increase competition, reduce the administrative burden and increase labour market flexibility have been important measures. The country's spending review will help to achieve the fiscal targets. Virtually all other countries are undertaking measures to improve fiscal solidity and the basis for sustainable growth without excessive imbalances. So despite the current challenges, countries' progress is strong and the fundamentals of the euro area as a whole are sound. The euro area's fiscal deficit is declining towards 3% of GDP; price stability is ensured; and the external accounts have remained close to balance. All these are reasons to pursue reforms with a strong degree of confidence. Why then do we still have tensions in a number of market segments? Let me first stress that a lot has been done at country as well as euro area level in terms of economic reforms and governance. But we need full implementation. We have to make clear that EMU is a union based on stability at national and aggregate levels. Stability at national level means completing reforms to ensure sustainable growth without major imbalances. Stability at aggregate level means implementing the vision recently presented at the summit. The central message of that vision is this: the euro is here to stay - and the euro area will take the necessary steps to ensure that. In my view, the core of the report submitted by President Van Rompuy is the identification of four building blocks: First, a that elevates responsibility for supervision of banks to the euro area level. Second, a that reinforces oversight of budgetary policies at the euro area level and also provides some fiscal capacity to support the functioning of the currency area. Third, an with sufficient mechanisms to ensure that countries can achieve sustained prosperity without excessive imbalances. And finally a that strengthens the legitimacy of EMU among euro area citizens and deepens its political foundations. These four building blocks are mutually consistent and coherent, and should be pursued in parallel. I am looking forward to the work on a roadmap that has started. In my view, three issues deserve particular attention: First, we need to move towards a further sharing of sovereignty in the fiscal, financial and economic domains. There can be no shortcuts in establishing a sound and stable EMU. Second, EMU is an integral part of the Treaty. This calls on all relevant bodies and actors to engage constructively on improving its functioning, not only at Union but also at national level. To call for an impeccable application of the Treaty and at the same time refuse closer union mentioned in Article 1 of the Treaty is inconsistent, to say the least. Third, we need to accompany deeper euro area integration with significant progress on democratic legitimacy and accountability. There is no doubt that you and your colleagues - the members of the European Parliament, the directly elected representatives of the citizens of Europe - will continue to play a central role in the steps towards political union.

2225,r130129b_ECB,euro area,2013-01-29,Speech on the occasion of the “Annual Danish Top Executive Summit 2013”,praet,0,"It is a real pleasure for me to share some thoughts today with such a distinguished group of business leaders. It may strike you as somewhat paradoxical for a central banker to address such an audience in a conference where the main theme is innovative thinking. After all, central bankers have traditionally been stereotyped as conservative and, well, rather dull. I firmly believe, though, that in a constantly changing world, decision-makers need to develop and maintain a healthy degree of scepticism around whether their current strategies and practices remain fit-for-purpose. This holds for decision-makers in business as well as in the public policy domain. And it is particularly relevant for central bankers, who have shouldered large part of the responsibility to navigate the economy through a once-in-a-generation financial and economic crisis. In the first part of my remarks today I will contour some salient features of central banks' response to the crisis. But I am sure that everyone here today is more interested in the future than pondering on what has been done so far. Indeed, as the macroeconomic and business environment remains challenging, the calls for a rethinking of business models and strategic orientations become more forceful. This is also the case in the monetary policy-making arena, where new strategic aspects are being promoted and debated around the globe. In the second and main part of my remarks I would, therefore, like to focus on two examples of such 'innovative' strategic thinking for monetary policy, assessing them from a euro area perspective. The first example concerns the objective of monetary policy. The second one refers to how policy is conducted to deliver the assigned objective. Prompted by the crisis, central bankers globally have thought openly and creatively. They designed and deployed a host of measures that went well beyond their traditional . This reaction of central banks has clear parallels to the way business leaders confront challenges. To illustrate this, let me briefly outline how features of central banking practices correspond to the four themes that the organisers of this conference have laid out as relevant for addressing challenges in the corporate world. The first theme is . Central banks typically rely on financial markets to transmit their monetary policy intentions to the real economy. During the crisis, dysfunctional segments of financial markets threatened to weaken or completely suppress this process. Central banks addressed these market dislocations in a resolute way, thereby showcasing the strength of the instruments that are at their disposal. Second comes . Ensuring that the expectations of firms and households regarding future inflation remain well-anchored is of the essence for keeping inflation in check. During the crisis, through words and deeds, central banks have strived to maintain these expectations under . The third theme is . The most obvious concept of horizon in the context of central banking is that of time-horizon. Both in normal times and in times of crisis, central bankers seek to maintain a medium-term horizon and thus avoid being overwhelmed by short-term considerations. At the same time, central banks have demonstrated a capacity to deploy crisis management measures within a very short time span, when this was necessary. The fourth and final theme of the conference was . Again this may sound paradoxical. Central bankers are proverbially prudent and risk averse. But there is a particular type of courage that they need to exhibit: the courage and firm character to stay the course and unwaveringly pursue the assigned mandate, when calls to serve other objectives can be increasingly loud. At the ECB, in particular, our response to the crisis has been two-pronged. The first element has been the swift reduction of our key policy rates to historically low levels in response to the emergence of downside risks to price stability. This is what is considered ""standard"" monetary policy action. The second element has entailed a host of measures to address dislocations in financial markets that were preventing the permissive monetary policy interest rates to be fully and evenly reflected in the lending conditions faced by households and firms across the euro area. These measures are typically referred to as ""non-standard"" and were intended to relieve liquidity and funding constraints in the banking sector, as well as unwarranted tail risks. This set of measures, therefore, serves to improve financing conditions over and above what can be achieved through reductions in the key ECB interest rates. In addressing the crisis we have been acutely aware of the need to strike a delicate balance between two sets of competing considerations. On the one hand, central banks were faced with the risk of a financial meltdown, which would have had profound implications for the real economy and which posed a serious threat to price stability. On the other hand, the resolute response of the central bank to the financial crisis relieves the pressure from other actors in the economy to measure up to their own responsibilities, correct the past unsustainable economic course and unwind excesses. This refers not only to governments but also to the private sector. In the past year we have seen significant progress in the European economic governance framework. These changes to the institutional architecture of the EU have been of great importance for restoring the appropriate incentives of the actors involved. Let me now turn to the discussion of 'innovative' ideas on strategic aspects of monetary policy. Since the early 1980s, a broad consensus has emerged across advanced economies which has elevated price stability to the main - although not always the sole - objective of monetary policy. Indeed, through the fixed-exchange-rate policy for the krone vis-a-vis the euro, Danmarks Nationalbank is effectively also among the central banks aiming at maintaining price stability. In most cases, the mandate for pursuing price stability has been operationalised by defining a numerical value for inflation that the central bank should aim to deliver. In advanced economies this value is low, typically within a narrow range around 2%. In the wake of the crisis, however, a number of pundits have called for an increase in the inflation rate that central banks should aim for. These calls have originated from diverse sources spanning academia, policy circles and financial markets. Proponents of this approach argue that this is a way to provide more monetary policy stimulus to the economy when nominal short-term interest rates - the instrument typically employed by central banks - cannot be reduced further because they are at zero, or close to zero. The rationale is that a higher inflation objective, if credible, would prompt firms and households to revise their expectations regarding future inflation upwards. By doing so, it would reduce further down real interest rates, which are not necessarily constrained by zero. As real - rather than nominal - interest rates matter for economic decisions such as investment and consumption, this change should promote economic activity. It is therefore argued that switching to a higher numerical aim for inflation will bring about a one-off accommodative effect when it is adopted. Moreover, it is claimed that it will also make it less likely in the future that nominal rates will become constrained by their lower bound. It may not surprise you to hear that I am very sceptical about this proposal, both in general terms and in the euro area context in particular. To explain my concerns, I shall step back for a moment and clarify an aspect of the ECB's monetary policy framework that is subtle, but in my view important. By contrast to many central banks around the world, the ECB does not practice inflation targeting. The ECB has been mandated by the Treaty (Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union) to maintain price stability over the medium term. The mandate itself does not entail a precise definition of what price stability means in practice. The Governing Council, therefore, decided to identify inflation values consistent with conditions of price stability. Price stability conditions do not necessarily entail stable prices, that is to say zero inflation. Inflation levels which are sufficiently contained to not interfere with economic choices are to be considered indicative of a stable monetary environment, and therefore of price stability. Inflation impinges on a large array of economic activities. For instance, it has an important effect on the way people take decisions about how to allocate resources across time. For example, a household's decision to consume today or instead save and consume in the future; a worker's decision to supply labour; or a firm's decision to invest. Moreover, inflation - especially if it is volatile - creates distortions in the information content of relative prices in the economy. This can lead to incorrect economic decisions if, for instance, firms wrongly interpret a general price increase as a signal of increased demand for their product. It also affects the frequency of changes in businesses' price tags and menus. Importantly, these effects lead to dead-weight losses and distortions in the allocation of resources and, therefore, to socially sub-optimal economic outcomes. The upshot is that the rate of inflation, above which distortions of economic decision-making start becoming material, is not a matter of policy preference, like an inflation target. Instead, it is a structural feature of the economy. It is linked to aspects such as contract and commercial pricing technologies; the tax and welfare system; and the demographic structure of the population, to name but a few. While these structural features of course can and indeed do change, they do so only very gradually and infrequently. Moreover, the direction and size of the effect of any such changes on the non-distortive inflation rate is not clear. It needs to be thoroughly examined and conclusively proven. Where does this leave us on the proposal to increase the numerical objective pursued by monetary policy? An inflation target can be changed to reflect shifting policy tastes and moving priorities. But a quantitative definition of price stability is a range of inflation values that can be qualified as unproblematic for economic decision-making. And this qualification is a factual statement, not a matter of tactical choice. Changing it on tactical grounds would be opportunistic and would harm the credibility of the central bank. For a central bank like the ECB, wedded to a range of inflation values that can be characterised as indicative of stable prices, a change to this range - and notably to its upper quantitative limit - is not conceivable barring analysis that convincingly argues for a wider range and larger values. A change not justified on these bases would create permanent damage to our ability to steer inflation expectations and contain inflation volatility. A loss of credibility can lead to an overshooting of inflation expectations. This would require a disproportionate withdrawal of monetary policy accommodation in the future to reign in inflation. Any initial boost to economic activity will therefore ultimately be more than reversed. Additional and unnecessary volatility in real activity would be the price to pay. In any case, it seems to me that the trade-off implied by this proposal is rather lopsided. Even if the central bank is successful in engineering precisely the intended permissive conditions as measured by a real interest rate decline, it is far from clear that this would indeed generate real effects even in the short-term. If, for instance, there are quantitative constraints in the availability of credit at play in the economy, the lower short-term real rates will fail to stimulate aggregate demand. Overall, therefore, one risks trading very uncertain gains - in terms of immediate policy accommodation - against rather certain costs - in terms of higher inflation, possibly for an indefinite period. Such risk-payoff structures are perfectly acceptable in the business world. Indeed taking calculated risks is often the mark of a successful business leader. For public policy, however, this strikes me as a deal that should not be made. But for some of the proponents of increasing the central bank's inflation objective this proposal is not motivated by a perceived need to stimulate aggregate demand when nominal interest rates are at zero or close to zero. Instead, they focus on another feature of the crisis: balance sheet adjustment in order to address the over-indebtedness problem. According to this argument, a higher inflation objective makes it less likely that the economy may get trapped in a destructive debt-deflation spiral of the type described by Irving Fisher. In the midst of the Great Depression, Fisher put forward a theory of economic crises that centred on the mutually reinforcing effects between over-indebtedness and deflation. According to this view, over-indebtedness beyond some point triggers distressed asset sales as debt is called in. This leads to abrupt deleveraging and a contraction of the amount of money in circulation. The destruction of money precipitates a fall in the general price level. Deflation in turn causes the real debt and interest burden to go up, thereby triggering a new bout of distressed asset sales and deleveraging and trapping the economy in a vicious circle. Deflation poses risks to the economy that - in some respects - are even more intractable than inflation. It is for this reason that the Governing Council's definition of price stability rules out negative inflation values. Moreover, the Governing Council's policy aim (within the range of positive inflation rates that are consistent with price stability) is sufficiently close to the upper bound of the range to stave off the risk that negative price shocks may unleash a self-reinforcing downward inflation spiral. But engineering financial repression in order to facilitate balance sheet adjustment would clearly violate the mandate to maintain price stability as a primary objective conferred upon the ECB by the Treaty. Earlier in my remarks I referred to the central bank's steering of inflation expectations as an illustration of the notion of . Moreover, I mentioned that the steadfast pursuit of the central bank's mandate exemplifies the notion of . I am very sceptical whether increasing the numerical definition of price stability helps in either of these dimensions. Let me now turn to the second example of an innovative proposal for monetary policy that I would like to discuss today. Unlike the previous proposal, this one does not relate to the objective of the central bank. Instead, it focuses on how the central bank can actually achieve its assigned objective, when the chances that the objective will be hit diminish. As I already mentioned, central banks typically conduct monetary policy by steering nominal short-term interest rates. These are the rates over which they can exert significant influence through the monopoly supply of central bank reserves. It is, however, widely accepted that it is primarily long-term interest rates that matter for the main economic decisions that the central bank wants to influence. How is it then that monetary policy can have an impact on the economy? Well, one can think of long-term interest rates as comprising two elements: expectations regarding the future evolution of short-term rates; and premia. Premia relate to the compensation investors demand for holding on to an asset for a specific period of time (the term premium). Moreover, they relate to the compensation for risks, such as the possibility of incurring capital losses due to difficulties they may encounter when selling the asset back to the market before maturity and at short notice (the liquidity premium). Changes in the current policy rate are typically interpreted by markets to also signal changes for short-term rates in the future. That is, they affect market expectations for future short-term rates and therefore, long-term rates. In normal times, this signalling channel works well and market expectations tend to be in line with monetary policy makers' intended long-term rates. When, however, short-term nominal rates are at zero or close to zero, this signalling channel loses its potency. The risk is that long-term rates may drift away from the central bank's intended path, in which case financing conditions in the economy will not properly reflect the stance of monetary policy. Some academic economists have advocated that, particularly in such a situation, the central bank should engage in active communication regarding the future path of policy rates. This communication would serve as a commitment device for the central bank to follow in the future the announced path of short-term rates, possibly conditional on actual developments in the economy. If this commitment is sufficiently credible, it will be effective in steering expectations regarding future interest rates and so influence the first component of long-term interest rates to which I was referring before. This is turn, will allow the central bank to deliver accommodative financing conditions in the economy over a certain horizon. A number of central banks around the world - most recently including the US Federal Reserve - have adopted some version of this approach. But the decomposition of long-term rates I mentioned a few moments ago suggests that there is also another possible way for the central bank to deliver appropriate financing conditions in the economy. This second approach is to exert influence on the premia, to the extent that they are unwarranted and reflect dislocations in markets. I would argue that the assessment regarding which approach is more appropriate depends on the particular situation each monetary policy maker faces. The approach focusing on communication regarding the future path of short-term interest rates is in principle applicable to a situation where there is a need to provide general, across the board, stimulus to the economy. Moreover, it applies in currency areas where financing conditions are more or less homogeneous throughout segments of the financial market and of the currency space. By this I mean a situation in which following a reduction in the array of risk-free interest rates, firms or households with comparable characteristics experience a broadly similar decrease in the borrowing rates they are charged for finance. Despite the notable improvements recently, this by and large is not the situation we are facing in the euro area. Domestic financial conditions across euro area countries remain fragmented. The spreads that lenders apply over benchmark rates are very uneven and, in some countries, abnormally high, reflecting dysfunctional market dynamics. Moreover, there is no uncontroversial way to define the term structure of the risk-free rate in the euro area. Unlike economies with a single fiscal authority or with a fully-fledged federal structure, the euro area comprises multiple sovereign states. The debt of each of these states has different liquidity and risk characteristics. Under these circumstances, it strikes me as far more appropriate to encourage conditions for a more even distribution of the very permissive liquidity provision that is in place. Engaging in promises regarding the future monetary policy stance would not be the most effective instrument for achieving this. Instead, we need to continue addressing the part of the premia in long-term rates in the euro area that is not warranted. But let me be clear, this does not mean that monetary policy instruments should be used to reduce credit spreads that reflect well-founded concerns regarding long-term debt sustainability and competitiveness. Is this alternative approach effective? In a nutshell I would say that the arsenal of the ECB's instruments for monetary policy implementation continues to be able to induce relaxation of conditions in term borrowing, when this is deemed necessary. In particular, the very long tenor of some of our refinancing operations combined with the full accommodation of banks' demand for such refinancing at the prevailing rate has proven to be very powerful. Indeed, this has been effective in lowering rates along the yield curve, without having to engage in commitments on the future stance of monetary policy to steer expectations. By providing security to our bank counterparties that central bank credit will remain in place for a sufficiently long horizon, we have acted on the liquidity premium component of term interest rates: the spread that remunerates banks lending in the inter-bank market for the risk that their borrowing counterpart may become illiquid and unable to honour the inter-bank credit contract at maturity. This added degree of comfort has encouraged market activity at decreasing term lending rates. But I do not want to imply that the approach that the ECB has followed thus far is free of pitfalls. For instance, the use of refinancing operations with a very long maturity results in an immediate expansion of the balance sheet when implemented. Such an expansion is not without challenges for central bank communication and for managing inflation expectations. Moreover, it has the unintended side-effect that it increases the encumbrance of banks' balance sheets. That is, it increases the share of bank assets that are already pledged as collateral, and thus unavailable to support the borrower's standing in additional credit operations. The share of bank assets that would be available to cover the claims of unsecured creditors in case of a default shrinks. This, in turn, amplifies the perceived loss given default of additional claimants and makes it more difficult for banks to access the unsecured money markets, which in normal times is the main market for marginal bank funding. We are fully aware of this risk and this is part of the reason that we have allowed for early repayment of our 3-year long-term refinancing operations. This way, when a counterparty judges that its chances of accessing market funding are being constrained by its use of ECB 3-year long-term refinancing operations, it can repay all or part of the amount borrowed earlier than its original maturity. In fact, tomorrow is the first opportunity to make use of the early repayment option. Euro area banks have taken this opportunity and have informed us that they will repay EUR137 billion of the slightly more than EUR1 trillion outstanding in such long-term operations. We will exert vigilance to ensure that - notwithstanding the legitimate decisions of individual banks to reduce their liabilities to the central bank - the overall liquidity conditions prevailing in the money market will remain consistent with the degree of accommodation that the current outlook for prices and real activity warrant. Whichever of the two approaches a central bank decides to use, it needs to be well appreciated that there are limits to what monetary policy alone can achieve. Delivering accommodative financing conditions and ample liquidity to the banking system has been necessary to avoid an abrupt deleveraging that could tip the economy into a destructive deflationary spiral. But parts of the banking system remain overstretched and this needs to be addressed in order to move decisively out of the crisis. Similarly, structural reforms need to be undertaken in order to restore the competitiveness of euro area economies. Only such reforms can deliver a lasting reversal of the fragmentation phenomena that the euro area has witnessed. And clearly neither of these tasks can be taken up by monetary policy. Let me conclude with a cautionary tale. Innovation is the quintessence of entrepreneurship and a cornerstone for economic growth and prosperity in market-based economies. But there can be innovations that create more problems than the ones they were originally conceived to address. I am reminded of the two mortal sins of economic policy-making that clearly transpire when reading Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff's excellent book on financial crises: arrogance and ignorance. Transposing this insight to the discussion on monetary policy frameworks, I would say that it is dangerously arrogant to believe that one's current approach to monetary policy is perfect and no improvements or changes will ever be needed. Certainly, before the crisis, a certain degree of academic group thinking and central bank professional hubris bred a sense of accomplishment that proved exceedingly complacent and ultimately self-defeating. Looking forward, we should temper a tendency to self-complacency - if not arrogance - with the strength of thought and the courage of vision. But courage and vision should not entice us into hazardous experimentations. We should not be ignorant of the lessons that history has taught. And history has shown that inflation was permanently brought under control when the public's inflation expectations became safely anchored. This in turn occurred when central banks gained credibility regarding their determination to stabilise inflation. This credibility was hard-earned but can be eroded easily. It would be irresponsible to jeopardise it. As regards the ECB in particular, I am convinced that our existing monetary policy framework provides enough scope for instruments to continue addressing the crisis in a decisive and effective way. We remain attentive to possible shortcomings in our policy framework and to changes in the structure of the economy that would warrant revisiting aspects of this framework. At present, however, I see no compelling case for change. Thank you very much for your attention.","['bankers', 'banking', 'crises', 'strategic', 'macroeconomic']","['central bankers', 'central banking', 'central banks', 'central bank', 'bankers seek']","['thinking central bankers', 'crisis central bankers', 'central bankers seek', 'paradoxical central bankers', 'approaches central bank']"
2281,r130623a_ECB,euro area,2013-06-23,The global crisis: lessons for international policy cooperation,asmussen,0,"Frau Oberburgermeisterin, dear laureates, meine Damen und Herren, It is my pleasure to be here today in Kiel and warmly congratulate Gro Harlem Brundtland, Joseph Stiglitz and Mohammed Ibrahim for winning the 2013 Global Economy prize. This prize has high reputation at the ECB where we believe that international cooperation and openness are crucial for improving people's standards of living. Some of you might recall that the prize was awarded in 2011 to former ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet. I would like to focus my intervention today on some lessons that can be drawn from the global financial crisis for international policy cooperation. I will start with a question. Does the crisis call for a substantial change in the approach to international policy cooperation? My answer is yes, for the following three reasons: , the world has become more interconnected and shocks are transmitted more rapidly across countries. Consider the following figures on global financial integration: Total foreign assets and liabilities of advanced economies rose from 68% of GDP in 1980 to almost 450% of GDP in 2010. The synchronisation of a severe economic and financial downturn, after the failures of major financial institutions in 2008, is a stark reminder of the significant interdependence of our economies. In 2009, 40 out of the 50 largest economies in the world experienced severe recessions. we need a new approach to international cooperation because the potential sources of shocks have multiplied. Alongside domestic shocks, countries are now more exposed than in the past to external financial shocks and global shocks to confidence. Keeping one's ""house in order"" is no longer sufficient to fully insulate domestic economies from these shocks. we need a new approach to international cooperation because the crisis has unveiled structural vulnerabilities in the global economy. In particular, our current institutions were designed for the economic system of the 20th century. They are not suitable for the global challenges of the 21st century. Global economic cooperation is needed to design better institutions. For these three reasons, we have to take the crisis as a serious opportunity to tune global policy making to today's interconnected world. The stakes are high, because the economic and social cost of the crisis has been large. Unemployment, especially youth unemployment, has significantly increased since 2008. As many as 73 million young people are estimated to be unemployed globally in 2013, especially in advanced economies - including the euro area - the Middle East and North Africa. Would reversing globalisation solve the problem? My answer is no. Being in northern Germany today, with its long tradition of openness and free trade ever since many of the cities along the Baltic coast joined the Hanseatic League, is a stark reminder of the benefits of global and European integration. And perhaps the case of Germany shows these benefits even more clearly: The share of Germany in global exports stood at around 8% in 2012. This makes Germany the largest global exporter after China (10%) and the US (9.8%). Exports of goods and service from Germany to the rest of the EU increased from around 20% of German GDP in 2000, to around 30% of GDP in 2012. Exports from Germany to the rest of the world increased from around 30% of GDP in 2000 to more than 50 % of GDP in 2012. Protectionism would clearly harm Germany and Europe. Therefore, we should not turn our back on globalisation. We should rather learn to better reap its benefits and make it more inclusive, in ways such that benefits are also fairly shared. The crisis offers an opportunity to learn from past mistakes. At the domestic level, it shows the importance of addressing imbalances with sound policies and structural reforms. At the global level, it shows the real cost of non-cooperative attitudes and policies. It therefore calls for a substantial change in institutional and governance frameworks for international policy cooperation. Let me first identify past mistakes by considering the main vulnerabilities unveiled by the crisis, both at the global and European level. On the global front, the crisis mainly revealed the existence of global economic governance failures and weak surveillance mechanisms. Global imbalances led to the accumulation of fragilities in the global financial system and to unsustainable global macroeconomic outcomes. For example, long term interest rates in the US and globally did not respond as expected to the Federal Reserve tightening cycle which started in 2004. This unusual behaviour of long term interest rates, which reflected the global savings glut, was labelled ""Conundrum"" by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. Persistently low long-term interest rates led to an aggressive search for yield and capital misallocations in the financial system. How the impact of domestic policies could spill over to other countries was not sufficiently appreciated. And the need for stronger international cooperation on this front was not recognised that much before the crisis either. In 2007 the IMF attempted to broaden the focus of bilateral surveillance to the implications of domestic policies for external sustainability. The attempt failed because some countries resisted to having their exchange rates labelled as ""fundamentally misaligned"" and to adjust their policies accordingly. A forum for global economic governance tuned to the economic realities of the 21st century was missing. Institutional frameworks to create sufficient peer pressure at the global level to prompt systemic players to act were weak. Thus, global economic governance and multilateral surveillance were not fully equipped for the new challenges of a globalised world. But the crisis also revealed acute failures in the global financial system. While financial sectors became increasingly international, supervision and regulation remained largely national in scope and only loosely coordinated at the international level. This encouraged regulatory arbitrage, the creation of large, complex financial intermediaries, and poor risk management practises. Several of these features also characterised our European continent. The crisis revealed fragilities in the governance, surveillance frameworks and financial architecture of the euro area. The rules and governance framework associated with the Stability and Growth Pact were not sufficiently enforced and, therefore, respected. Efforts to promote structural reforms, for example under the Lisbon Agenda, were weak. As we know now too well, macroeconomic imbalances within the euro area grew unabated. Competitiveness developments across Member States diverged to an unsustainable extent. For instance, a harmonised indicator of price competitiveness shows that between 2000 and 2008 Germany became almost 20% more competitive in real terms vis-a-vis the rest of the euro area average. Over the same period, price competitiveness decreased by around 10% in Italy and Spain vis-a-vis the euro area average. In addition, despite the unprecedented level of financial integration in the euro area, banking supervision remained domestic. Cross-border resolution frameworks, in turn, did not reflect the increasing complexity and interconnectedness of the European banking system. Overall, inappropriate policies in one country in the euro area could create negative externalities for other euro area countries, and possibly destabilise the monetary union as a whole. The crisis hence revealed that the euro area needs much stronger mechanisms to correct inappropriate domestic policies. It also revealed that the euro area's ability to absorb shocks, especially asymmetric ones, and its frameworks for crisis management and resolution need to be significantly strengthened. What has been done so far to address the global and European vulnerabilities that were revealed by the crisis? Let me start with the global perspective. Economic governance and surveillance mechanisms have been strengthened appreciably. The G20 was upgraded to the Leaders' level, replacing the G7 as the premier forum for international economic cooperation. This made governance more encompassing and legitimate. The G20 represents 65% of the world population (including the EU), while the G7 represented slightly more than 10% of it. The key emerging market economies are now at the table. The first three G20 Leaders' summits (Washington, London and Pittsburgh) led to important achievements, including a coordinated policy response to the cyclical downturn, a solemn commitment to keep the global economy open and more resources to the IMF. The G20 also gave political impetus to a broad agenda for financial reform to make the global financial system more stable and more resilient. Work is under way in different fora to fill regulatory gaps, make regulation more consistent across countries, limit the possibility for arbitrage, improve supervision of cross-border institutions and facilitate their resolution. The crisis has also led to radical changes in the European institutional and governance framework. In little less than four years, we have created the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), a permanent crisis resolution mechanism for the euro area. We have also strengthened euro area economic governance, for instance through the ""Fiscal Compact"" and the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure. The creation of the single supervisory mechanism (SSM) at the ECB is also under way. It will make supervision consistent with the level of banking integration in Europe. These are essential elements needed to break the adverse feedback loop between banks and sovereigns. What needs to be done to finish the job and make the global economic and financial system more stable and resilient to reap the benefits of globalisation fully? We still have a long way to go, admittedly, and this is still not the time to rest on our laurels. Let me hence sketch what issues remain unsolved. The global reform agenda has lost momentum, as the sense of urgency imposed by the crisis has vanished. On the global financial reform front, for instance, progress has slowed down in several respects. This has generated frustration and led to country-specific regulatory initiatives. These initiatives should not create market distortions, harm global and European financial integration or lead to regulatory arbitrage. Progress on the front of global economic policy-making has also slowed down. The G20's effectiveness is now being questioned. Being larger than the G7, it is also more heterogeneous in terms of values and represented interests. Therefore, reaching an agreement at the negotiation table is more challenging. Also, the G20 might appear distant to citizens, which is not helpful for legitimacy, as the latter is intrinsically linked to local proximity. Finally, not all countries are at the table. An entire continent like Africa is only represented by one country, namely South Africa. Despite its limitations, the G20 remains essential for global economic cooperation insofar as there is no obvious alternative. Returning only to the G7 or the G8 is not an option. At the same time, it was premature to conclude that the former formats are dead with the rise of the G20. The conclusions of this week's G8 Summit in Northern-Ireland on fighting tax evasion and on world trade for example showed that the smaller formats can stimulate important momentum for the G20 and other fora like the WTO. Where do we stand on the European front? An essential lesson from the crisis is that the Economic and Monetary Union is an incomplete project. The ""Four Presidents"" Report outlined the necessary steps to move towards a genuine monetary union, which I strongly support. , we need to complete with great urgency the banking union. We need a clear and transparent assessment of the conditions of the banking system (""asset review"") before the Single Supervisory Mechanism takes over. We also need a strong commitment towards an effective Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) which is an indispensable element of the banking union and a necessary complement to the SSM. The SRM would allow for a smooth winding down of banks, especially those with large cross-border activities. It needs to entail both a strong Single Resolution Authority (SRA) as well as a Single Resolution Fund (SRF). The latter should be financed with ex-ante risk based levies on the banking sector. These arrangements would enhance the credibility of the system and ultimately break the link between banks and sovereigns. , we need to further strengthen and integrate our economic governance frameworks to make our economies more competitive and resilient to asymmetric shocks. One front on which European governance can greatly improve relates to structural reforms. Ultimately, structural reforms benefit the many at the expense of the few. A recent OECD Report called this the ""Double Dividend"" of structural reforms: they increase growth, and if implemented properly, decrease inequality. One way to create incentives for Member States to engage in structural reforms could be the provision of temporary financial assistance to alleviate the short-term costs of reforms, in exchange of a contractual agreement to complete them. The contract would entail clear goals in line with EU policies and measurable targets. These contracts could be useful in several instances, especially in the presence of ""reform and bailout fatigue"", and constrained public finances. , the increasing level of integration within Europe calls for a new institutional design to ensure legitimation, accountability and democratic control. On the one hand, Governments should ensure that national parliaments are appropriately informed and involved in decision processes. On the other hand, national parliaments are often not in the best position to incorporate the EU common interest in their decisions. Therefore, European institutions should be strengthened, in particular the European Parliament which could maybe also convene in a euro area format. This would ensure that the level of accountability matches the level at which decisions are taken. It is time for me to conclude, Globalisation has lifted out of poverty and improved the living standards of millions around the world. It has greatly benefited Germany and the rest of Europe. It has benefited emerging Asia. And it is now benefiting large parts of Africa. We should not reverse globalisation. We should rather elevate our game and adapt our toolkit to the new realities of the 21st century. This will enable us to reap the full benefits of globalisation and share gains more fairly. Stronger international policy cooperation would help to deliver stronger, more sustainable and balanced growth globally. It is the best means to avoid currency wars. It would help to make growth more inclusive and decrease unemployment, especially among the youth. It would increase peer pressure, thereby improving governance, especially in developing countries. Stronger international policy cooperation would also help to make growth models more compatible with the scarcity of natural resources and environmental constraints. The crisis has offered an opportunity to learn from past mistakes. This opportunity should not go wasted. As the sense of urgency imposed by the crisis vanishes, the risk is that complacency slows down reforms, while the road that lies in front of us is still long. But the decision to complete the global reform agenda through enhanced international cooperation is entirely in our hands. This is why I believe that the Kiel prize for the Global economy is a reminder for us of the importance of globalisation and international cooperation. Therefore, I want to conclude with warm congratulations to the winners of the prize. Thank you for your attention.","['globalised', 'globalisation', 'crisis', 'macroeconomic', 'reforms']","['global crisis', 'crisis global', 'crisis international', 'world crisis', 'crisis economic']","['international cooperation crisis', 'crisis international policy', 'global financial crisis', 'crisis global european', 'globalised world crisis']"
2400,r140709b_ECB,euro area,2014-07-09,Keynote speech at the Europlace Financial Forum,praet,0,"Over the past seven years, the financial system has been severely shaken, in particular one of its major components: the banking system. The adjustment process is well-advanced, as witnessed by higher liquidity and capital buffers; better crisis management institutions. The finalisation of the ECB comprehensive assessment will be a key milestone in the near term. But this will not be the end of the road: looking ahead, we also need to build a financial landscape that is more diversified, more capital market-based for all segments of financial products. It is with this perspective that the ECB has singled out securitisation as one priority; but there are others, such as venture capital. A note of caution however: the financial system cannot contribute to growth if the underlying fundamentals are not sound. Throughout the crisis, the ECB has deployed a number of instruments, conventional and unconventional. Our approach to crisis management and inflation control in pursuit of our objective was mostly founded on an expansion in size and tenor of temporary credit operations with our counterparties. This reflected the predominant role of banks in euro area financial intermediation and, hence, for the financing of the euro area real economy. In the post Lehman environment (when banks in the euro area suffered the wave of contagion from the US subprime confidence crisis) and, again, in the face of an escalation in the debt crisis (when banks in selected countries suffered the consequences of a near- loss of market access of their sovereigns) our temporary credit operations were adapted so as to reduce banks' liquidity and roll-over risks. This meant providing banks with unlimited liquidity at a fixed price and with expanded maturity and against a wider pool of collateral: In the aftermath of Lehman's demise, we changed the liquidity allotment system from one where we fixed the quantity of liquidity lent to banks (being confident that the market would distribute that quantity widely at a price that reflected our intended monetary policy stance) to one where we fixed the price of liquidity and let the market decide over the quantity that is needed to support that price. Also, in the aftermath of Lehman's default we extended the term at which liquidity was lent to banks from three to six months to one year (in June 2009) and we broadened collateral rules. By allowing banks to liquefy a larger share of their assets and by stabilising the liquidity horizon of those banks in liquidity deficit, which had lost , we averted a major disruption in the first stages of the transmission mechanism. In the face of the 2011-2012 escalation of the debt crisis (when the confidence collapse reached two systemic countries) we concentrated on banks' loss of to address a major roll-over risk. We conducted two three-year operations (LTROs) that helped banks in a wide part of the euro area to do funding substitution. A significant share of the increase in Eurosystem credit to banks in Spain and Italy, for example, was used to reimburse bank securities that were coming due over the next 12 months and would not have been rolled-over by the market. Without this relief banks would have had to shed assets on a large scale (given high leverage), with potentially systemic implications for the euro area economy as a whole. Finally, when a major tail risk emerged in the securities market in mid-2012, as more and more weight was given in the pricing of market debt to the risk of a euro area break-up, we announced our decision to conduct Outright Monetary Transactions in the market for sovereign securities, conditional on the issuer submitting to strict multilateral surveillance. In a very difficult environment the ECB succeeded in preserving its credibility, as witnessed by the anchoring of inflation expectations throughout the crisis. Over the following 12 months or so, the cumulative effects of this action were able to eliminate fears of disaster events, remove tail-risk from the market and thereby reduce fragmentation. However, with growing evidence since the start of 2013, banks in large parts of the euro area started to respond to the funding challenges and the need to reinforce their capital structure by reducing their activities, in particular their loans to the real economy. The funding crisis had morphed into a trend which could lead to a widespread credit crunch. Therefore, in May 2013 against the background of subdued monetary and loan dynamics and very weak economic sentiment, and with the aim to support prospects for a recovery, we decided to cut our key interest rates further. This, in conjunction with the abundant liquidity conditions that had been created as a consequence of the 3-year LTROs, helped stabilise the overnight money market rates around levels close to the lower bound of our monetary policy corridor - which had been reduced to zero in July 2012. However, soon thereafter, market expectations about the likely future evolution of monetary policy worldwide changed abruptly, notably as a consequence of Fed communication about their intention to end its bond-buying programme. And this change of market sentiment introduced heightened volatility in the term structure of money markets rates of the euro area as well, beyond very short maturities. The sharp swings in the term structure that we observed as a consequence starting in late May threatened to lead to a withdrawal of the monetary accommodation that we had introduced in early May. As a response, the Governing Council decided to clarify its policy orientations going forward, conditional on the outlook for inflation and weak economic activity. Our forward guidance concerning the future likely evolution of our key interest rates which the Governing Council started to provide in July 2013 was a strong signal by the Governing Council on its commitment to fulfil its mandate and anchor market interest rates around levels that were considered consistent with the underlying macroeconomic conditions in the euro area. The forward guidance formulation that was adopted in July 2013 - and substantially reconfirmed subsequently - communicated our assessment of the economic situation, reiterated our two-pillar strategy and the implications on the monetary stance. It was particularly important to decouple the monetary conditions of the euro area from those prevailing in other major currency areas, in a context where the monetary policy cycle in the euro area was different from that in the US and the UK. Overall our guidance succeeded in securing our accommodative stance and promoting more stable market conditions. Consistent with our guidance, and with a view to reinforcing its grip on the interest rates in the private interbank market, in we further our interest rates and we reduced the width of the monetary policy corridor to 25 basis points. In March 2014 we reinforced our guidance by referring to the degree of economic and subdued money and credit creation as conditions for reducing or maintaining rates unchanged even in the face of a recovering economy. More recently we have been confronted with a situation of successive downward revisions of our expected inflation path. To give you an example, in December 2013 Eurosystem staff projected HICP inflation at 1.1% for 2014. In the most recent projection round of June 2014 - that is, about six months later - inflation was expected to be only 0.7% in 2014. While surprises were initially more in headline (as opposed to core) inflation and stressed (as opposed to non-stressed) countries, very recently the surprises have been more in core inflation figures, and in non-stressed countries. The reasons are well-known: A mixed bag of supply shocks (energy & food; structural reforms in strained countries) and persistence of underutilised capacity in a wide area of the euro area... ... in a context in which banks' credit - a critical ingredient to a self-sustained recovery of investment and durable consumption - was withdrawn in many countries and/or made available to companies and households at interest rates probably only partially justified by increasing lending risk. To address risks and implications associated with a prolonged period of low inflation, we have to ensure that the developments do not become entrenched in inflation expectations. This is why we further cut our interest rate last month in the context of a broader of mutually reinforcing measures aimed at addressing impairments in lending conditions and the knock-on effects that these impairments are having for the real economy and inflation. Loan growth is still contracting; lending rates have not declined in line with improvements in financial markets. While the lending rates (for stressed countries) reflect credit risk, borrowers' is in part endogenous. High lending rates contribute to higher loan delinquencies, which in turn increase the need for banks to make provisions on past legacy loans by increasing lending rates; so, ex post, higher delinquencies justify high lending rates, and there is a mutually reinforcing spiral of high lending rates, high credit risk and poor macroeconomic conditions. The TLTROs are designed to contribute to breaking this spiral. They are expected to ease overly tight conditions . The first and most important channel is through a reduction in term funding costs for banks. Note that the interest rate on the TLTROs will be fixed over the life of each operation, at the rate on the MROs prevailing at the time of take-up, plus a fixed spread of 10 basis points. So if a bank does well in its lending performance, it enjoys very attractive refinancing conditions for up to four years. Funding relief, however, does not per se guarantee better credit conditions for banks' customers, unless the supply of loans shifts in parallel and lending mark-ups are kept constant or even pushed down as banks are encouraged to move down the demand curve for loans by chasing good credit with lower lending rates. This is why the targeted nature of the TLTRO is important: by making funding relief conditional on generation of new lending volumes, the TLTRO will encourage a shift outward in the credit supply curve. By simply moving along the demand schedule, this outward shift will reduce the price for lending while increasing new loans. If banks do not manage to exceed a certain benchmark in terms of net lending, they will not benefit from the additional allowances that can be earned under the TLTROs. This shows that the TLTROs are indeed targeted, rather than a broad-based unconditional provision of liquidity as in the case of the earlier 3-year LTROs. Second, and as a side effect, the TLTROs are expected to increase excess liquidity, which reduces interest rates in the short- to intermediary-term money market. Remember that banks take into account the money market curve when pricing their loans as the pricing basis over which they charge additional lending spreads in order to recover funding and capital costs. By keeping the money market base rate stable at compressed levels, the TLTROs will reinforce the lowering of the ECB's key interest rates. Third, by partially replacing term funding in the form of more expensive bank bonds, the TLTROs can create a scarcity of investible assets, which will result in lower yields and easier market funding conditions even for banks that have not taken part in the operations. It may also create spillover effects to other segments of the corporate credit market, as investors in bank bonds will be induced - by a scarcity of supply - to diversify away from that market and re-invest in other market segments. The latter mechanism is not dissimilar to the ""portfolio balance channel"". The TLTROs are targeted operations. Indeed, there are positive and negative incentives for banks to use the funds for lending, rather than for alternative investments. First, due to the large multiplier that converts the flows of a bank's new net lending to non-financial corporations and consumers (relative to a specified benchmark) into additional borrowing allowances under the facility, there is a strong inducement for banks to beat their lending benchmark and expand lending beyond their pre-announcement plans. Second, banks that as of April 2016 cannot prove that they have beaten their benchmark will be asked to reimburse in advance funds that otherwise could be borrowed for a period of up to 4 years. Through these combined effects, we believe that a widespread use of this facility has the potential to halt the vicious circle of constrained lending, weak macroeconomic conditions and elevated loan delinquencies, and re-ignite a positive ""credit multiplier"" process. And in fact the combination of monetary policy measures decided last month already led to a further easing of the monetary policy stance. In particular: We have seen a marked downward shift in the whole term-structure of the money market. For example, in the overnight segment, EONIA fell by 12 bps to 0.03% between 4 June and 1 July. Over the same period, the 3-month EURIBOR declined by 10 bps and the 1year 4year OIS forward rate declined by 23 bps. To gauge the overall easing effect of our measures one may go back a bit more in time and look at developments since early May, when the Governing Council signalled its readiness to act in June. For instance over the period 7 May [the day before the May GC] and 1 July the 3-month EURIBOR declined by 13 bps and 1y4y OIS forward rate declined by 36 bps. Since early May we have also seen some compression of liquidity premia [as for example evidenced by a decline in the spread between KfW bonds and German bund yields with the same residual maturity] and government bond spreads. The monetary operations to take place over the coming months will add to this accommodation. All measures together should support lending to the real economy, support the economic recovery and - through that avenue - steer inflation rates to levels closer to 2%. As usual, effects on the real economy will take time as the measures will need to work their way through the economy. Although the policy reactions were often too weak and delayed, they have finally been decided and implemented in a number of countries: structural adjustment at national level has proceeded (not sufficiently in all countries). Also reforms at euro area level have been launched. The Banking Union is a key element. It will not only lead to a more effective and resilient banking system also to better across countries. The impact on financial markets has been . But let me be clear: the work is not yet done. Finally questions have been raised on the potential implications that a protracted period of monetary accommodation may have on financial stability. First of all, not acting forcefully would have had very serious financial stability implications. Second, looking forward, our monetary policy accommodation is essential to keep medium to long-term inflation expectations well anchored also for financial stability reasons: a fall of expected inflation leads to an increase in expected real interest rate which makes debt sustainability more difficult. That being said, monetary policy needs to be aware of the potential implications that a protracted period of monetary accommodation may have for financial stability. There are two major risks: first, postponement in bank balance sheet repair; and second, bubbles in asset prices. The first risk is that cheap funding allows banks to back-load the deleveraging of their balance sheets and encourage so-called ""ever-greening"" practices which in turn may prolong macroeconomic stagnation. After a financial crisis, banks have to undergo a thorough clean-up. Otherwise, they may continue to roll over legacy loans, thus restricting the resources available for new lending in support of the real economy - so-called ""ever-greening"". This risk is being countered through the ECB's on-going comprehensive assessment of banks' balance sheets - consisting of the asset quality review and a stress test - which will be completed roughly in parallel with the launch of the first TLTRO. Thus, banks will not be able to benefit from funding relief without also repairing their balance sheets where necessary. Also, macroprudential measures should be used, if needed, to smooth the financial cycle in specific sectors or jurisdiction. The design of the measures should also limit to some extent the second risk to financial stability, the build-up of bubbles. The TLTROs exclude explicitly loans to households for house purchases. Furthermore, credit developments are always closely monitored when the assessment from the economic analysis is cross-checked with the signals coming from the monetary analysis, the two pillars of the ECB's monetary policy strategy. Thus, concerns that the measure could stoke a housing bubble seem unwarranted. Nonetheless, it is important to keep in mind the distinction between what monetary policy can and should do, and what is the domain of macro-prudential policy. Monetary policy has the clear primary objective to maintain price stability in the euro area over the medium-term. Macro-prudential measures should be used, if needed, to smooth the financial cycle in specific sectors or jurisdictions. I would like to thanks Jan Hammermann und Arthur Saint-Guilhem for their contribution in the preparation of this speech. The existence of a ""portfolio balance channel"" has been extensively discussed recently in the context of the Fed's large scale asset purchases. There is a vast literature assessing empirically the portfolio balance channel in that context. See, for example, Gagnon, Joseph, Matthew Raskin, Julie Remache and Brian Sack (2011), ""The Financial Market Effects of the Federal Reserve's Large-Scale Asset Purchases"",","['banking', 'ecb', 'banks', 'euro', 'bank']","['crisis ecb', 'banks euro', 'financing euro', 'eurosystem credit', 'ecb monetary']","['euro area financial', 'eurosystem credit banks', 'role banks euro', 'intermediation financing euro', 'environment banks euro']"
2411,r140911a_ECB,euro area,2014-09-11,Keynote speech at the Eurofi Financial Forum,draghi,1,"Ladies and gentlemen, It is a pleasure to be here tonight with you in Milan. In a recent speech in Jackson Hole, I spoke about the need for a policy mix involving monetary, fiscal and structural policies to jump-start the economic recovery in the euro area. We are currently facing a set of conditions - low growth and low inflation, high debt and high unemployment - that can only be addressed by concerted action on both the demand and supply sides of the economy. This requires all actors - both at national and European level - to play their parts in line with their respective mandates as laid down in the EU Treaties. No monetary stimulus, indeed no fiscal stimulus, can be successful unless accompanied by the right structural policies - policies that foster potential growth and instil confidence. I would like to illustrate this argument by focusing on investment, which will also be discussed at the informal ECOFIN this weekend. Investment has been one of the great casualties of this crisis. The downturn in business investment in the euro area since 2008 has been much more severe than in earlier business cycles. From peak to trough, business investment decreased by around 20%, against 15% in the 1992 recession. The level of business investment in the euro area has only slightly improved since 2008, whereas in the US it is above its pre-crisis level. We will not see a sustainable recovery unless this changes. A decisive rise in investment is essential to bring inflation closer to where we would want to see it, to stimulate the economy, and to bring down unemployment. So what can we policy- makers do to revive investment? My main message today is that only if structural, fiscal and monetary policies go hand in hand will the euro area see investment return. Let me focus in particular on the decisive contribution which structural policies can make. I see two key areas where government action both at national and European level should help to revive business investment. First, the regulatory environment should be made more favourable to economic growth. Second, companies need to have access to more diversified sources of financing: the launch of a capital markets union could contribute to achieving this and, at the same time, help overcome the remaining fragmentation of financial markets. Let me briefly elaborate on each of these points. Business activity would greatly benefit from an improvement in the regulatory environment, in particular as regards product and labour markets. The differences between Member States are quite striking in respect of wage differentiation (across workers and between sectors), employment adjustment rigidities, barriers to entry in product markets and the ease of opening and running businesses. For example, in some Member States contractual disputes between firms take on average little more than a year to resolve, while in other countries they take more than three years. Start-ups in the latter countries have to deal with more red tape than their counterparts elsewhere. Another telling example relates to the regulated professions whose number varies considerably across euro area Member States [from 45 in Estonia, 170 in Italy, 219 in France to 304 in Slovakia, according to European Commission figures]. Such barriers to entry limit competition and employment, creating undue rents for a select few to the detriment of customers. These are just a few examples. In many cases, these obstacles sap entrepreneurial spirits, especially of young, innovative firms that create most of the new jobs and that are highly sensitive to changes in investment opportunities. These examples show how converging towards best practice in the euro area would mean radical improvements in the business environment. Spain provides an encouraging example in this regard. Among the large euro area countries, investment in Spain is projected to rebound strongly over the coming two years, notably due to the combination of business-friendly reforms and lower personal and corporate taxes. More recently, other countries have also committed to improve the business environment. A forceful and swift implementation of the necessary reforms is now key in order to reap the benefits as quickly as possible. A second area of key relevance for investment and also of direct interest to the Eurofi community here tonight is the need to diversify sources of financing and to overcome financial fragmentation. Until now, banks have been the main source of lending to companies. The crisis has shown the drawbacks of over-reliance on a bank-centred lending model. So we also need to develop reliable sources of non-bank lending, such as equity and bond markets, securitisation, lending from insurance companies and asset managers, venture capital and crowdfunding. This is why the ECB fully supports the intention of the incoming President of the European Commission to create a capital markets union. Such a step would be a natural development of the Single Market and would benefit all EU Member States. We believe that one area that deserves particular attention is the development of a well-functioning market for simple, transparent and real asset-backed securities (ABS). This would allow banks to still originate loans - notably to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) - while preserving their balance sheet capacity. In order to achieve a well-functioning ABS market, it is important that the regulatory treatment of securitisation is proportional to the risk of ABS. In this respect, the ECB welcomes efforts to have a differentiated regulatory treatment of simple, transparent ABS built on real assets. Moreover, the provision of public guarantees should be considered to support lending to SMEs, as other countries do, such as the US. A further integration of corporate bond and equities markets is also essential to overcome the present fragmentation in the euro area and to ensure more robust cross-border lending and investment flows. To achieve this, we will have to streamline differences between countries, for instance, in the legal protection of borrowers' and lenders' rights as well as in national taxation and insolvency procedures. To sum up, structural policies are more multifaceted than they are often perceived to be in the political debate and can have a very significant impact on investment in a variety of ways. Yet this is not the only area where governments can make a difference. They have at their disposal a second policy lever of direct relevance for investment, namely fiscal policy. Companies will only invest the future when there is confidence and certainty the future, about the medium-term fiscal path, and ultimately about taxes. We need a consistent and credible application of the Stability and Growth Pact across time and across countries. Within the existing framework, governments can find space to support productive investment, and achieve a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies by lowering the tax burden and reducing unproductive current expenditures. In parallel, it may be useful to have a discussion on the overall fiscal stance of the euro area with the view to raising public investment where there is fiscal space to do so. In this regard, there is also a complementary role to play at European level in supporting the rebound in private investment. I therefore welcome the EUR300 billion package announced by the incoming Commission President two months ago. Let me finally say a few words on the contribution of monetary policy. We successfully fought the confidence crisis in the euro that raised interest rates to abnormal levels. We provided the euro area banking system with unprecedented funding. We have continuously lowered our policy rates. Now we have reached the lower bound. To ensure that this very accommodative monetary policy stance is transmitted to the real economy across the euro area in an equal manner, we have also deployed a number of non-standard tools. Increasingly our focus here has shifted towards the financing of small and medium-sized enterprises, which heavily rely on bank financing and in many cases are struggling to retain access to credit. These companies may be small, but when they face a funding problem, it is a big problem for all of us, given that they employ around three-quarters of the euro area's workforce. In June, we decided to launch a series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations - TLTROs - to ensure that banks have sufficient liquidity to lend to the real economy. The TLTROs have been designed to encourage banks to increase their lending to the non-financial corporate sector. In addition, we have also taken measures to underpin specific market segments that play a key role in the financing of the economy. Last week, the Governing Council decided to start buying high-quality asset-backed securities and covered bonds in October. We will purchase both existing and newly issued ABS, which are simple, transparent and real in the sense that the underlying assets consist of loans to the euro area non-financial private sector. Let me respond to the concerns recently expressed about the risks posed to the integrity of our balance sheet. It is worth recalling that senior tranches of ABS have proven to be high-quality assets. According to the Association of Financial Markets in Europe, only 0.12% of European residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) outstanding in mid-2007 have defaulted since then - compared with 22.05% for US RMBS. Default rates for consumer finance ABS and SME collateralised loan obligations have also remained low, well below 1%, throughout the worst financial and economic crisis we have experienced. As regards covered bonds, credit quality is ensured by a double recourse (on the underlying assets and on the issuer), which is in fact comparable with the double protection that exists in our standard repo operations. Overall, the decisions announced last week were taken with a view to underpinning the firm anchoring of medium to long-term inflation expectations, in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%. We expect the two purchase programmes to effectively complement the TLTROs in enhancing the functioning of the monetary policy transmission and in providing further monetary accommodation given that we have now reached the lower bound. The newly decided measures, together with the TLTROs, will have a sizeable impact on our balance sheet, which is expected to move towards the dimensions it used to have at the beginning of 2012, and the Governing Council stands ready to take further action if needed, in compliance with its mandate to maintain price stability. Ladies and gentlemen, it is time for me to conclude. My bottom line is also my starting line. Investment is rightly said to be today's demand and tomorrow's supply. Yet investment in Europe is falling short. If we don't manage to get investment going again, we will weaken the economy in the short run and undermine its prospects in the long run. Our efforts should therefore be focused on jump-starting investment. However, and this was really the crux of my argument, we will only manage to stimulate investment if structural, fiscal and monetary policies mutually reinforce each other.","['fiscal', 'eurofi', 'recession', 'stimulus', 'euro']","['economy euro', 'crisis euro', 'investment euro', 'monetary stimulus', 'investment europe']","['fiscal stance euro', 'economic recovery euro', 'euro area investment', 'economy euro area', 'monetary stimulus fiscal']"
2592,r160629a_ECB,euro area,2016-06-29,Opening remarks at the Academy of European Law,mersch,0,"For over 20 years the Academy of European Law (ERA) has provided a forum for law practitioners to debate European legal issues. And the need for such a forum remains strong today - maybe stronger than ever. Shakespeare's character Tranio in Taming of the Shrew exhorts us to ""do as adversaries do in law - strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends"". This is an appropriate sentiment for tonight's event: the ERA is providing food and drink and has invited me to give you all something to argue about. This is a critical juncture for the European Union (EU). A number of states have re-imposed border controls to stop the inflow of refugees, anti-EU parties are gaining popularity in many member states and one of the largest members has just voted in a referendum to leave the Union. These factors provide a challenge to our institutions and legal frameworks at EU and at national level - a challenge that also legal professionals across Europe need to engage with. I believe there are many reasons why the vision of a united Europe is worth fighting for. Let me mention just four: to preserve peace; to improve economic prospects; to defend our values; and to increase personal options continent-wide. The founding fathers of the EU were willing to make political sacrifices to end bloodshed in Europe, following two devastating wars just decades apart. Let us not forget that we are here in a former prison in which every respected Luxembourg family had relatives who stood up for these values. After 70 years of peace in western Europe it is easy to be complacent that war will not happen again. Yet the current situation in Syria, Iraq, Ukraine and that of the Balkans in the 1990s shows that peace is vulnerable, even on our doorstep. But defence and security have to be understood as a common endeavour. The economic benefits of the Union are well documented: free trade, the removal of non-tariff barriers, the elimination of transactions costs of foreign exchange payments and the introduction of a single yield curve across the euro area to name but a few. These measures have reduced costs for businesses and households, and in turn generated higher income and created jobs. Looking ahead, also the recovery is on track to overcome the crisis. Europeans, for all our differences, have many values that we share more closely than even close allies such as the United States. Our social model ensures adequate healthcare and workers' rights that are absent elsewhere. We value highly human and civil rights ranging from gender equality, data protection, to the condemnation of torture, including the rejection of capital punishment. The protection of these values and rights relies on the vigilance of the legal professionals here in this room and elsewhere. This is even more important vis-a-vis a reality of extreme and obsessive forms of nationalism. The EU has also increased personal choices. The ability to travel, work and live across borders has been enhanced. The European Health Insurance Card permits European citizens to obtain healthcare wherever they are. 1.5 million people, perhaps including some of you here today, have completed part of their studies in another member state as part of the Erasmus programme. More than 15 million EU citizens have moved to other EU countries to work or to enjoy their retirement. This wider range of options increases people's wellbeing. These reasons, and the other positive aspects of membership, have been drowned out in debate by concerns over migration and the large wave of refugees from troubles in the Middle East and elsewhere, the impact of the crisis, disaffection with high levels of unemployment - especially youth unemployment, and a perceived lack of accountability and legitimacy of the EU institutions. I fully recognise that Europe in its current state is not perfect. The crisis has shown that Economic and Monetary Union is incomplete, and further work is required, particularly in the areas of banking and credit markets. In order to function democracy requires that citizens can hold decision-making accountable at the level at which these are taken. But today we can only elect and sanction at the national level, while decision making is widely done at the European level. Therefore, we have to enhance the decision-making process at the European level through appropriate democratic control measures and more direct election and sanctioning features. The solutions to these issues are not simple, and reasonable people may well disagree on their form. This forum is an ideal place to debate what laws, rules and institutions we need to put in place to strengthen the integrity of the Union. I promised earlier that I would give you something to argue about tonight! I believe the vision of a united Europe is worth striving for. To make this vision come true, we also need to understand the forces behind the populist dissatisfaction with the Union, and not dismiss them. The referendum debate in the United Kingdom has been acrimonious. In striving to deliver a united Europe, we need to be united in ourselves and build a shared EU-wide identity that delivers the necessary democratic legitimacy to the institutions.

2634,r161117a_ECB,euro area,2016-11-17,The future of global financial integration,praet,0,"Financial globalization was a salient phenomenon of the past three decades, but since the financial crisis of 2007-2009 there are increasing signs of a backlash against globalization. The evidence for such a trend reversal is mixed. Quantity-based measures of global financial integration, such as gross external assets relative to world output, have flattened out, and would merely point to a pause. Flow measures provide a gloomier picture: international capital flows are now down to half their pre-crisis levels relative to world output, and are especially weak among mature economies. Internationally active banks have increased domestic lending faster than foreign lending. Several emerging markets have erected barriers to global finance and introduced controls against capital inflows and, more recently, outflows. Price-based measures of global financial integration, meanwhile, present a different picture: international equity market co-movements, for example, remain strong. By some estimates, they remain as high as ever in more than a century. It is not just the extent of financial globalization, which might have changed since the financial crisis, though. Its perceived benefits and costs in academic and policy debates have changed, too. Before the crisis several studies already called for a ""reappraisal"" of the net benefits of financial globalization. This has taken place along two main dimensions: (i) re-assessing the stability of capital flows, and (ii) re-examining whether financial integration leads to a productive allocation of savings and to agglomeration effects in certain geographic areas. As regards the first dimension, the notion that financial integration which is based on long-term instead of short-term capital flows is more resilient has become increasingly persuasive. For the second, it has been recognised that financial integration typically only delivers lasting positive effects on growth if countries meet certain thresholds of institutional development. In the absence of sufficient institutional development, capital flows would most likely be used unproductively, feeding unsustainable lending booms and encouraging excessive short-term capital inflows. This can in turn leave countries vulnerable to sudden stops once optimism fades due to local or global shocks. Indeed financial cycles tend to have a global component, and hence the discussion about financial globalisation has evolved into one about the ""global financial cycle"", which is driven by US monetary policy. The assumption is that non-US central banks have lost their ability to influence domestic long-term interest rates, even in the presence of flexible exchange rates, due to the existence of ""US-driven"" global financial cycles. As a result, the classic trilemma may have morphed into a dilemma between financial openness and monetary policy autonomy. In addition to risks related to unsustainable lending booms, which can be fueled by capital flows, policy makers and academics recently also stressed risks stemming from disruptive capital outflows, which can endanger financial stability, for example if large amounts of bank deposits are pulled out of a country. In the context of this debate on financial integration, academic papers on the welfare optimality of taxation of international capital flows have also thrived since the crisis. Moreover, the standard international policy consensus on financial globalization has been shattered by the crisis. For example, the IMF adopted in 2012 an institutional view that said temporary and targeted capital flow management measures can be useful in certain circumstances, i.e. when the room for manoeuvre for macroeconomic adjustment is limited. The Fund is now reviewing this institutional view. It is expected that the effectiveness of capital flow management measures, which have been recently used in emerging and some advanced economies, will be assessed in a balanced way, taking into account all intended and unintended effects, which such measures may generate. In parallel, the OECD is reviewing its code of liberalization of capital movements. With the review, the OECD aims to facilitate collective action by boosting transparency and shared understandings on good practices related to managing and liberalising capital flows. A particular area of interest is the treatment of capital flow measures that are used as macro-prudential measures. For policy makers, this is important since at times there may be tradeoffs between financial integration and financial stability. As part of this policy discussion, I would like to underline that openness to international capital flows should continue to help diversify country-specific shocks. This would help to smooth cross-border consumption between good and bad states of the world through international borrowing and lending. Admittedly, the economic magnitude of gains from financial risk sharing remains debatable. In monetary unions, financial risk sharing remains an essential channel for leveling out the effect of asymmetric shocks across regions. Risk-sharing traditionally works through two main channels: cross-border lending to households and companies; and cross-border holdings of productive and financial assets. In a monetary union like the euro area, which has no central fiscal authority, both channels should have contributed to containing the fallouts from economic shocks in member states. What we have experienced is the opposite: financial flows amplified the crisis when some euro area countries faced a sudden stop. This followed years of increasing cross-border lending and borrowing and excessive risk-taking, mainly through bank-based financial intermediation. When panic led to an abrupt reversal of financial flows and fragmentation of the euro area banking system, the central bank had to take over the role of the interbank market in providing liquidity to banks in stressed countries. The Great Moderation masked the fault lines in the Economic and Monetary Union's financial architecture. The Great Recession revealed all the cracks, including the pernicious link between euro area banks and sovereigns. The sovereign debt crisis resulted in capital controls in two euro area countries, leading to a temporary reversal of financial integration in Europe. This proves that expected benefits of risk sharing can turn sour , for example if the composition of flows is too risky and too vulnerable to abrupt changes in international investor sentiment. The key policy-relevant question is, which institutions and rules are necessary for financial risk sharing to achieve all the benefits it has in theory? Financial risk-sharing benefits and, more broadly, financial integration are deeply rooted in the soundness of institutions and policy rules. This is in line with the already mentioned empirical findings on the lasting growth effects of capital flows, which depend on institutional thresholds. Sound institutions and policy rules are necessary to guarantee clear definitions of property rights and procedures in case of financial stress, to ensure the stability of the domestic financial system through regulation, supervision and resolution frameworks, to mitigate the cost of cross-border and cross-currency transactions, and to create a level playing field for financial tax regimes. In addition, the benefits from financial integration will only materialise if underlying economic stability prevails. The institutions and policy rules in question vary in their extent and reach, depending on whether one considers the national level, the euro area level or the global level. At the national level, for instance, the existence of a national currency guarantees that there is no exchange rate risk hampering capital flowing from one region to another; tax rules are usually applied uniformly across a nation, which prevents arbitrage; and the regimes for regulation, supervision and resolution are identical, at least for specific parts of the financial sector, such as banks, which strengthens depositors' confidence. At the global level, financial stability arrangements naturally differ across countries. There has been significant progress in aligning global frameworks for regulation, supervision and resolution, but more still needs to be achieved. There is no global jurisdiction for cross-border and cross-currency transactions across countries and tax regimes differ widely from one country to another, offshore financial centers and non-cooperative jurisdictions being extreme cases. Last but not least, underlying economic conditions and policies widely differ across countries, which affect incentives for cross-border capital flows and for financial integration to deepen or weaken. And at the euro area level, financial stability arrangements before the crisis were not in line with the requirements of monetary union. While Member States shared a single currency, there was no single framework for supervision and resolution. There was also a general lack of awareness of the risks that such a fragmented institutional framework could pose for area-wide financial stability. This led to a general misperception of financial risk, and short-term, uni-directional financial flows. The financial crisis of 2007-2009 and the sovereign debt crisis of 2011 were wake-up calls for our continent. They exposed the incompleteness of our monetary union, the fragility of our financial integration, and the limited scope for action of institutions other than the ECB. In short, they strongly underscored the need to move to a genuine Economic and Monetary Union. Euro area leaders have since launched the Banking Union, to be complemented over time with the Capital Markets Union, to deepen financial integration within the euro area. The Banking Union will help strengthen cross-border lending to households and companies within the euro area. The Capital Markets Union aims to strengthen integration of capital markets within the area. This, in turn, will help strengthen cross-border holdings of productive and financial assets. The Banking Union and the Capital Markets Union involve the creation of new institutions and policy rules, which will help the euro area to reap the full benefits from financial risk-sharing. Some of the key ingredients of the Banking Union are already in place: the Single Supervisory Mechanism was created in 2014, the same year as the Directive on Deposit Guarantee schemes was adopted, which harmonises the level of deposit protection and payout periods in the European Union. A Single Resolution Mechanism has been operational since 1 January 2016. It implements the EU-wide Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive in the euro area. Banking Union, however, remains work in progress. Further steps are under discussion, such as a fiscal backstop for the Single Resolution Fund and the creation of a European Deposit Insurance Scheme. These aspects will no doubt remain high on the European policy agenda, because our continent needs to strengthen the integration of its banking and capital markets substantially in the absence of alternative risk-sharing mechanisms, at least for the time being. To sum up, sound economic policies as well as policy rules and institutions that are necessary to oversee their implementation at a European level, remain a prerequisite for financial integration to support financial stability. They benefit not only to the euro area, but to the global economy at large.","['finance', 'globalization', 'banking', 'financial', 'macroeconomic']","['financial globalization', 'global finance', 'financial globalisation', 'global financial', 'financial flows']","['financial globalization taken', 'globalization changed financial', 'extent financial globalization', 'financial globalization changed', 'benefits financial globalization']"
2671,r170327a_ECB,euro area,2017-03-27,The economic situation in the euro area and the implications for monetary policy,praet,0,"Today I will discuss the macroeconomic situation and monetary policy in the euro area. As a central bank with a clear price stability mandate, we need to ultimately judge economic developments in the light of their implications for price stability. Despite the recent increase in headline inflation, largely on account of rising energy and food prices, underlying inflation pressures remain subdued. Furthermore, convincing signs of a self-sustained convergence in inflation towards levels that are consistent with the Governing Council's objective of below, but close to, 2% have yet to materialise. To ensure price stability over the medium term, we must look through changes in headline inflation to the extent that they are transient. In the near future, we will have to assess how the forces that are driving prices today can influence the outlook for price stability in the medium term and help durably stabilise inflation around our goal. The economic recovery will support domestic price pressures. Indeed, the upswing is continuing at a steadily firming pace and is broadening across sectors and countries. The recovery has proven to be resilient against past external shocks and influences. In fact, real GDP growth in the euro area has expanded for 15 consecutive quarters, growing by 0.4% during the final quarter of 2016. Economic sentiment is at its highest level in nearly six years and unemployment is at its lowest level in nearly eight years. Looking beyond the euro area, there are signs of a somewhat stronger global recovery and increasing global trade. So overall, as economic conditions are improving, also the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook have become less pronounced, although they remain tilted to the downside, mainly because of global factors. Our monetary policy measures have been instrumental in these positive developments in the euro area economy, as well as in supporting the resilience of the recovery in the face of external influences and prevailing uncertainties. The comprehensive set of measures introduced since June 2014 has worked its way through the financial system, leading to a significant easing of financing conditions for consumers and firms. Together with improving financial and non-financial sector balance sheets, this has strengthened credit dynamics and supported domestic demand. Since June of that year, bank lending rates for both euro area households and non-financial corporations have fallen by around 110 basis points. Lending rates for very small loans, which can be taken as a proxy for loans to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), have declined by around 180 basis points. The significant improvement in funding conditions for SMEs is especially encouraging as they provide two-thirds of total private sector employment in the euro area. The sharp reduction in bank lending rates has been accompanied by easier access to funding, as recent surveys have shown. These positive developments have been supported by the second series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations, as a result of which banks are passing on the favourable funding conditions to their customers. Moreover, these improvements are not limited to interest rates: bank lending volumes have also been gradually recovering since early 2014. Market-based funding conditions, too, have improved significantly in response to the corporate sector purchase programme launched in June 2016. Looking forward, we are confident that the ongoing economic expansion will continue to firm and broaden. Incoming data, as well as improving consumer and business sentiment indicators, suggest that the cyclical recovery is gaining momentum. Private consumption growth continues to be a key driver of the ongoing recovery, which is underpinned by improvements in labour market conditions, with unemployment steadily falling despite a rise in participation. These developments increase households' real disposable income, which in turn boosts their spending. Business investment is also expected to continue recovering amid support from better corporate profitability and the very favourable financing conditions. As for price developments, after hovering at levels well below 1% for three years, with occasional dips into negative territory, euro area headline inflation edged higher towards the end of last year and reached 2% in February. This upward movement of inflation mainly reflects increases in energy and food prices. Underlying inflation - which relates more to domestic price pressures - continues to remain very subdued and has yet to show clear signs of trend inversion as unutilised resources still weigh on wage and price growth. For example, the annual rate of HICP inflation excluding food and energy has mostly remained below 1% since late 2013. Concerning the outlook for price developments, our latest staff macroeconomic projections suggest that the strong upward pressures on headline inflation from recent increases in energy and food price inflation are not expected to fundamentally change the medium-term outlook for price stability. In fact, while the staff projections indicate that the recent price pressures will cause a hump in the inflation path in 2017 and 2018 relative to the trajectory expected in December last year, the projection for headline inflation for 2019 has remained largely unaltered. By ensuring accommodative financing conditions, monetary policy will continue to support domestic demand by mobilising idle resources. This will lead to a build-up of domestic price pressures and ultimately pull underlying inflation up as remaining slack in the economy is gradually reabsorbed and the output gap narrows further. In turn, this will facilitate a durable return of inflation back to a level that is below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Today, an important element keeping underlying price pressures subdued is muted wage dynamics, which are shaped by many factors. At this stage, besides weak productivity developments, there is still a significant degree of labour market slack that keeps a lid on wage growth. Furthermore, the process of setting wages is to some extent backward-looking in a number of euro area countries, reflecting formal and informal indexation mechanisms. Additionally, the timing of wage negotiations plays a role in postponing the point in time when growing confidence that inflation is approaching the ECB's intended medium-term level starts to become more visible in aggregate wage figures. Moreover, weak wage growth could also reflect previous downward wage rigidities: difficulties in reducing wages during earlier stages of the crisis may result, symmetrically, in a slower upward adjustment of wages as labour market conditions improve. Overall, while we are certainly seeing a firming, broadening and more resilient economic recovery, we still need to create a sufficiently broad and solid information basis to build confidence that the projected path of inflation is robust, durable and self-sustained. Underlying inflation pressures still give scant indications of a convincing upward trend as domestic cost pressures, notably wage growth, remain subdued. Importantly, the economic recovery and the outlook for price stability are still predicated on the very favourable financing conditions that to a large extent depend on continued monetary policy support. Absent that quantum of support, the progress towards a sustained adjustment that we see in our projections is likely to be slower or even stall. Therefore, we need to look through the recent surge in inflation, which is driven by transient factors that will probably fade before long. Our conclusion that a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation is still needed for underlying inflation pressures to build up and support headline inflation in the medium term remains valid. Of course, monetary policy cannot be the only source of support for growth: action from other policy areas is needed to ensure a sustainable economic recovery. Structural reforms can play a key role in turning the cyclical recovery into a structural recovery and the current low interest rate environment makes it politically and economically easier to implement them. Such reforms, if carried out now, will help to promote favourable economic conditions down the road.","['inflation', 'macroeconomic', 'euro', 'gdp', 'monetary']","['stabilise inflation', 'growth euro', 'inflation approaching', 'inflation robust', 'policy euro']","['monetary policy euro', 'durably stabilise inflation', 'stabilise inflation goal', 'gdp growth euro', 'euro area economy']"
2725,r170825a_ECB,euro area,2017-08-25,Sustaining openness in a dynamic global economy ,draghi,1,"The global recovery is firming up. In some countries like the United States, this process has been visible for some years, in others like Europe and Japan, the consolidation of the recovery is at an earlier stage. So it is fitting that our discussions are now focusing not only on how to stabilise the economy, but also on how to make it more dynamic - while at the same time improving people's welfare. At the centre of this debate is the question of how to raise potential output growth, which has slowed from around 2% in OECD countries in 2000 to around 1% today. Without stronger potential growth, the cyclical recovery we are now seeing globally will ultimately converge downwards to those slower growth rates. Slower growth will in turn make it harder to work through the debt and demographic challenges facing many advanced economies. With the population growth rate in those economies projected to slow, the burden of raising potential growth must fall on productivity. There are a number of areas in which domestic policies can encourage an upward shift in productivity growth, such as competition, research and development, and insolvency regimes. But when thinking about the economy, one of the key ingredients for raising productivity is openness. Open trade, investment and financial flows play a key role in the diffusion of new technologies across borders that drive forward efficiency improvements. The social consensus on open markets has, however, been weakening in recent years. This is driven not so much by a belief that open markets no longer create wealth, but by the perception that the collateral effects of openness outweigh its benefits. People are concerned about whether openness is , whether it is and whether it is . As Karl Polanyi observed many years ago, if the dislocation created by an open market goes beyond a certain point, protectionism is society's natural response. So a central element of efforts to raise productivity growth - and build a dynamic global economy - must involve responding to these concerns about openness. And this is a feat countries cannot accomplish by themselves. Although domestic welfare policies are, of course, essential to the task, a commitment to working together through multilateral institutions is just as important. This is because fears about fairness, safety and equity ultimately reflect a lack of trust in other countries' regulation and enforcement. One of the main reasons why multilateral institutions exist is to create regulatory convergence, and therefore to increase trust between countries. And perhaps the most important area where this applies today is global financial sector regulation. One of the key questions facing the global economy is whether the trend towards ever greater economic openness, which has defined the last three decades, is coming to an end. Temporary trade barriers have indeed risen from covering around 1% of products in 2000 to more than 2.5% today, with the crisis accelerating this pattern. The same is true of anti-dumping actions. That said, at the global level openness is still viewed favourably; three-quarters of people consider growing trade and business ties with other countries to be a positive trend. But those polled in rich countries are more negative than in the pre-crisis period. Given the established gains of trade, this is plainly a concerning trend for the global economy. International trade results in a more efficient use of production factors and in specialisation where comparative advantage exists, thereby raising productivity growth. And welfare gains from trade for firms and consumers follow from the wider availability of cheaper and better quality products. Moreover, for advanced economies the importance of trade may actually be growing. As economies converge towards the global technological frontier, innovation becomes more important for sustained productivity growth. And as OECD research has shown, openness to trade is a crucial factor in enabling an economy to benefit from frontier innovation. According to OECD estimates, in the case of a 2% acceleration in multi-factor productivity (MFP) growth in a frontier economy, the productivity spillover will be 0.3 percentage points higher for a country that trades intensively with the frontier economy than for one which trades less intensively. To put this in context, MFP growth has averaged only around 0.5% in OECD countries since 2000. Thus a turn towards protectionism would pose a serious risk for continued productivity growth and potential growth in the global economy. And this risk is particularly acute in the light of the structural challenges facing advanced economies. Old-age dependency ratios are rising, putting more pressure on public finances. By 2025 there will be 35 people aged 65 and over for every 100 persons of working age in OECD countries, compared with 14 in 1950. At the same time, public debt levels have surged in those countries from 56% of GDP in 2007 to around 87% today. Only higher potential growth can provide a lasting solution. So, clearly, to foster a dynamic global economy we need to resist protectionist urges. But to do so, we also need to identify how best to respond to protectionism. Much has been written over the past few years about the negative effects of free trade and the need to pay more attention to those who benefit less from it. The debate has typically focused on the extent to which welfare policies can be used to share the gains of trade more evenly. Though this is a complex issue, I have no doubt that making better use of public policies to support the more vulnerable members of society, not just financially but also through education and retraining, is a vital part of the equation. More work needs to be done in this area and it is important to learn from best policy practices. But the other key question is: how can we work together to make openness sustainable? What role can multilateral cooperation play towards this goal? This is the angle I would like to address today. Its importance becomes clear when one thinks about the three main areas of concern that people have about open markets that I mentioned earlier. First, there is the concern about whether openness is - i.e. whether all are playing by the same rules and applying the same standards. This manifests itself in fears about currency manipulation by trading partners, dumping practices and lack of reciprocal market access. Second, there is the concern about whether openness is - i.e. whether it exposes people to harmful spillovers from abroad. This is perhaps most visible, at least for economists, in the case of cross-border capital flows , but it also applies in areas such as agriculture and biotechnology. Third, there is the concern about whether openness is - that is, whether it disproportionately benefits some groups in society over others. Though it is not straightforward to disentangle the effects of trade and technology on inequality - and they may in fact be linked - the perception that openness contributes to inequality has become more widespread. In each case, multilateral cooperation, leading to regulatory convergence, is a precondition for addressing the underlying causes of these concerns. To demonstrate this, let me draw on our experience of managing openness within the European Union. As regards , the point is obvious: regulatory convergence provides the strongest assurance that the playing field is level right across the European market. This is why, as borders have opened within Europe, common supranational powers of legislation and enforcement have strengthened in parallel. For example, the Single European Act in 1986 not only launched the single market, it also substantially extended the powers of the EU to make laws, the role of the European courts to rule on them, and the powers of the Commission to execute them. The logic was that a single market could only be sustainable over time if all participants could be certain that they faced the same rules, and had recourse to the same courts in the case of infractions. Despite the political events of last year, this symmetry between regulatory convergence and market deepening has, by and large, been a success. In fact, the free movement of people, goods and services within Europe is regularly mentioned in polls as one of the two most positive aspects of the EU, the other being peace among its Member States. Similarly, what has permitted the Single Market to survive various financial and consumer protection crises is its ability to restore by adapting market-wide regulation and enforcement. To give an illustration, the internal market for frozen foods overcame the mis-selling scandal of 2013, when horsemeat was sold as beef, in large part because it was met with an improved food labelling and EU-wide inspection regime that restored trust. By contrast, a perceived lack of regulatory convergence between the EU and other countries, especially regarding food safety, is one reason for opposition to preferential trade agreements, such as the TTIP. More fundamentally, following the sovereign debt crisis, the euro area experienced first-hand the risks of a diverging supervisory and regulatory framework for cross-border finance - and faced a serious threat of financial market fragmentation when those flows reversed. Safety was restored by elevating supervision and resolution to the European level with the banking union. This was key to re-establishing trust in the banking system and reviving cross-border capital flows within Europe. These are only the first steps, but the direction of travel has been drawn. When it comes to the effects of openness on , it is admittedly less obvious how multilateral cooperation represents a solution to the fears being expressed. As I said, such fears typically have to be addressed by national distributional policies. But there is also an important international dimension, in particular related to tax avoidance. Indeed, the problem many have with openness is not just that it redistributes income between different social groups. Almost everything that happens in a market economy - skill-biased innovation, churning of firms - redistributes income in some way, and we have in place mechanisms to deal with those outcomes, such as tax systems. Where trade may differ from these other market forces, however, is in the perception that, in Dani Rodrik's words, it ""undercuts the social bargains struck within a nation and embedded in its laws and regulations"". For example, increasing openness to trade and finance is perceived by some to shift the burden of taxation from footloose capital to labour, or to create pressures to reduce labour protections to boost the competitiveness of domestic producers - the ""race to the bottom"". Such perceptions, and the sense of injustice they fuel, are deeply damaging to public faith in open markets - and this is where multilateral solutions can play a role. Addressing tax arbitrage between jurisdictions, for instance, can clearly best be achieved by countries cooperating via international institutions. Likewise, taking a stand against race-to-the-bottom dynamics that threaten labour protections, calls for a common regulatory approach. Again, our experience in Europe offers some insights into how this can work, as well as into some of the difficulties involved. Thanks to its common legal framework, the EU has successfully upheld labour standards even as its market has expanded to lower-income countries. The Single Market has no doubt prompted some relocation of jobs across countries, and this has at times triggered fears of ""social dumping"". But in fact openness has not fundamentally challenged labour protections. One main reason for this is that safeguards central to the European social model have been progressively embedded in European law, ensuring gradual convergence in labour standards among EU countries. Thus, while there is still heterogeneity, the gap between them is narrowing. Preferences about the degree and type of social and labour protection differ across the world, and I am not claiming that those in the EU should be a model for everybody. The point here is that through multilateral decision-making, the EU has successfully built and defended the single market, addressing the perception that openness is always a source of inequality. At the same time, in areas where unanimous decision-making is more prevalent, Europe has not always used the potential of its multilateral structure to the same extent. This is the case, for instance, in combatting profit-shifting and tax avoidance, although progress is now being made, which clearly chimes with the mood of EU citizens. In short, there are certain concerns about equity that can most effectively - and perhaps only - be addressed through multilateral actions. As such, in tandem with well-targeted welfare policies, they are a key part of the policy toolbox for making openness sustainable. Clearly, the European model involves several unique features. In particular, it depends on a relatively advanced political structure that helps reconcile multilateral cooperation with democratic control, which is difficult to replicate elsewhere. Still, EU countries are generally more open than other advanced economies and perhaps have fewer problems of skewed income distribution. So what lessons can we draw for the global economy from our experience? The most salient is that, at a time when disaffection with openness is growing, multilateral institutions become , not less important. They provide the best platform to address concerns about openness without sacrificing open markets. So organisations like the WTO, which make sure that trade is governed by rules and is subject to fair arbitration, remain vital to ensuring that global trade is perceived as fair and safe - while at the same time avoiding protectionism in disguise. And bodies that foster global cooperation, such as the G20, remain just as necessary to reconcile openness with equity. The OECD/G20 initiative to combat tax base erosion and profit-shifting is just one example of such cooperation. That said - and going by our experience in Europe - the area where we need a special focus today is cross-border finance. Organisations that facilitate convergence in financial regulation and supervision, such as the Financial Stability Board and the Basel committees, are key in this context. Within these committees, a substantial amount of work has been done since the crisis to strengthen microprudential regulation, as well as to design and calibrate macroprudential tools. This work has been essential for at least three reasons. The first reason is that finance is the most mobile production factor, and therefore the most likely to cause dangerous spillovers. This makes convergence in financial regulation one of the most important components of a sustainable open economy. And we should remember that diverging financial regulation would endanger not only financial openness, but also global trade, since they are often two sides of the same coin: finance and trade are complementary in spreading knowledge and underpinning global value chains. A striking feature of the global financial crisis was indeed the collapse in world trade: between the third quarter of 2008 and the second quarter of 2009 global trade volumes declined by approximately 15%. The second reason is that we have only recently witnessed the dangers of financial openness combined with insufficient regulation. International financial flows both contributed to and propagated the global financial crisis and the ensuing collapse of trade, output and employment. Financial integration only survived relatively unscathed because the global regulatory response was swift and decisive, creating a financial system that posed fewer risks to the world economy. Any reversal would call into question whether the lessons of the crisis have indeed been learnt - and thus whether financial integration can still be considered safe. Third, financial regulation interacts critically with monetary policy. Lax regulation implies an underestimation by regulators of incentives which lead to behaviour that is individually profitable, but socially costly. Given the large collective costs that we have observed, there is never a good time for lax regulation. But there are times when it is especially inopportune. Specifically, when monetary policy is accommodative, lax regulation runs the risk of stoking financial imbalances. By contrast, the stronger regulatory regime that we have now has enabled economies to endure a long period of low interest rates without any significant side-effects on financial stability , which has been crucial for stabilising demand and inflation worldwide. With monetary policy globally very expansionary, regulators should be wary of rekindling the incentives that led to the crisis. To design and agree, in reciprocal trust, a regulation that preserves financial stability without unnecessarily restricting the flow of credit to the economy, while revisiting the post-crisis regulatory framework where necessary, the FSB and the Basel committees remain essential. This is also because, for large economies, changes in domestic regulation have international consequences. Global financial conditions account for 20-40% of the variation in countries' domestic financial conditions, as shown by recent research from the IMF. Let me conclude. To inject more dynamism into the global economy we need to raise potential output growth, and to do so with ageing societies we need to lift productivity growth. For advanced economies that are close to the technological frontier, this depends crucially on openness to trade. Yet openness to trade is under threat, and this means that policies aimed at answering this backlash are a vital part of the policy mix for dynamic growth. Some of those policies can be implemented domestically, but some can only be effectively enacted through multilateral cooperation. Multilateral cooperation is crucial in responding to concerns about fairness, safety and also equity. By encouraging regulatory convergence, it helps protect people from the unwelcome consequences of openness. And ensures that we do not lapse into over time.

2773,r171124a_ECB,euro area,2017-11-24,Ricardo Reis’ contribution to Macroeconomics,constancio,0,"I am very happy to be here to celebrate with you the awarding of the Bernacer Prize to Professor Ricardo Reis from the London School of Economics. As you know, the Prize is awarded to an outstanding, young European economist who works in the fields of macroeconomics and finance. Without a doubt, Ricardo is one of the leading macroeconomists of his generation. Today, we recognise in particular Ricardo's influential research on expectation formation and sticky information as well as on the role of fiscal policy in business cycles. Ricardo's most cited paper - and he has written many frequently cited papers - is ""Disagreement about inflation expectations"", co-authored with Gregory Mankiw and Justin Wolfers. This early paper showcases what have been the consistent characteristics of Ricardo's work: his research is data-driven, innovative and deals with topics important for economic policy - in this case monetary policy, given the interest of central banks in inflation expectations. While there had been work on inflation expectations prior to Mankiw, Reis and Wolfers, their paper - together with other work done around the same time by Ricardo, some of it with Gregory Mankiw, and independently by Woodford and Sims - opened a new chapter in research on expectation formation. Since then, numerous economists have been motivated to develop models of data on expectations, and to study the implications of such models for the transmission of shocks and for policy. Mankiw, Reis and Wolfers documented substantial disagreement among both consumers and professional economists about expected future inflation. The extent of disagreement in the data evolves over time, together with the state of the economy. A high dispersion of inflation expectations is positively correlated with a high level of inflation, and with a high variance in recent inflation. Ricardo and his co-authors also studied the average forecast across agents, finding weak sensitivity of the average forecast to news and serially correlated forecast errors. Subsequent research, which builds on the work of Mankiw, Reis and Wolfers, has confirmed and refined these findings. It has established that expectations deviate systematically from full-information rational expectations. The average forecast across agents of a macroeconomic variable responds slowly to news. If a shock raises inflation for some time, the average forecast of inflation increases by less than inflation itself. Moreover, the average forecast error in a cross-section of agents is likely to be of the same sign as the revision in the average forecast. If inflation is rising and forecasts tend to be revised up, the average forecast error is likely to be positive - people are likely to under-predict inflation. This is, of course, in contrast to the theory of full-information rational expectations, where forecast errors are unpredictable. The same pattern is present in the data for survey-based and market-based measures of inflation expectations, for expectations of macroeconomic variables other than inflation, among consumers and professional economists, and in different countries. Ricardo, together with Gregory Mankiw, developed a theory that accounts for the salient features of the data on expectations. In the sticky information model of Mankiw and Reis, economic agents update their information only sporadically. When agents fail to update, they make decisions based on information that is to some extent out of date. The updating is staggered across the population, so that at any one time some people are paying attention to news, while others remain inattentive. As a result, information diffuses gradually in the economy. The average forecast responds slowly to news, as in the data. Each individual makes the best forecast given their information. At the same time, however, the average forecast error across agents can be predicted by the revision in the average forecast, as in the data. Finally, again in line with the data, agents in the model disagree, because their information sets differ. In sum, the sticky information model suggests how expectations are actually formed in the real world. A number of interesting policy implications arise from this more real-world account of expectation formation. As Ricardo showed in a paper with Lawrence Ball and Gregory Mankiw, optimal monetary policy - given productivity and demand shocks - is price level targeting, as opposed to inflation targeting. This is a controversial proposition with practical inconveniences that render it unpopular among central bankers. There have thus been no attempts to implement it. A broader lesson for monetary policy resulting from the analysis is that long-term inflation expectations are likely to be more stable in a sticky-information world. Central bankers will probably find this message reassuring. On the other hand, the sticky information model suggests that, once long-term inflation expectations become de-anchored, their return to a level consistent with price stability may take time and effort on the part of the central bank. Ricardo and Gregory Mankiw constructed and estimated a complete dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with sticky information. Their DSGE model features what the authors refer to as ""pervasive stickiness"": the idea that information sets are updated sporadically, which originally applied to price-setting firms, is extended here to include consumers and workers. The resulting theory predicts gradual responses of consumption, output and wages to macroeconomic shocks, in addition to the sluggish response of prices. Remarkably, sticky information is the only source of slow adjustment in the model. By contrast, the New Keynesian DSGE model requires multiple frictions, such as habit formation in consumption and investment adjustment costs, on top of price and wage stickiness, in order to capture the persistence in the macro data. The sticky information approach suggests that the origin of the pervasive slow adjustment in the data may be different from the sources highlighted in the New Keynesian literature. In an influential pair of papers, ""Inattentive Producers"" and ""Inattentive Consumers"", Ricardo studied the decisions of agents who face the costs of acquiring, absorbing and processing information. Such agents rationally choose to be inattentive to news, only sporadically updating their information. The optimal frequency of updates, or the length of inattentiveness, depends on features of the economy such as the variance of shocks. Upon aggregation, the economy behaves like the sticky information model of Mankiw and Reis. Let me turn to Ricardo's work on the role of fiscal policy in business cycles. While a large body of literature in this area exists, much of it assumes a representative agent and focuses on government purchases or taxes. Ricardo, in a joint paper with Hyunseung Oh, documented that during the Great Recession much of the increase in government expenditures across the OECD countries was in government transfers. To study the effects of transfers, Ricardo and his co-author proposed a model without a representative agent or Ricardian equivalence, in which transfers affect the economy because of imperfect credit markets, uncertainty and sticky information. Building on this work, Ricardo and Alisdair McKay constructed a model to assess the role of automatic stabilisers in business cycles. paper will be a benchmark in the literature on fiscal policy, and they now have a follow-up paper that adds the normative perspective. Their analysis - novel and more generally applicable - combines the New Keynesian DSGE framework with the incomplete-markets, heterogeneous-agent model of consumption and inequality. The resulting theory includes a realistic array of automatic stabilisers, such as unemployment benefits and progressive income taxes. The authors are able to quantify a number of mechanisms by which automatic stabilisers may work. One lesson is that unemployment benefits are especially effective in supporting aggregate demand in a recession. People who become unemployed reduce their consumption sharply, in particular if their period of unemployment is likely to be prolonged. Moreover, those who remain employed increase their precautionary savings in a downturn as the probability of losing their job rises. In this environment, more generous unemployment benefits have strong effects on aggregate spending. Another takeaway is that - in the US data from the so-called Great Moderation period - automatic stabilisers appear to have played little role in smoothing out the business cycles, with monetary policy being much more important. That said, Ricardo and Alisdair show that automatic stabilisers can have more sizeable effects when the central bank is constrained by the effective lower bound on its policy rates. . In any case, the conclusion about automatic stabilizers having subdued effects opens up the debate about how to make them more effective and about the need in some situations to use discretionary fiscal stabilisation policy. Recently, Ricardo has worked on models in which the central bank's balance sheet is explicitly present. Such models are in demand in the wake of the global financial crisis, given the need to understand the effects of the expansion of the balance sheets of many central banks. Ricardo has developed, together with Robert Hall, a framework to analyse central banks' solvency under ""new-style central banking"" and studied a model in which the interest rate on bank reserves is the main policy tool of the central bank. As you know, besides his research activities, Ricardo has also been an active participant in policy debates, notably concerning safe bonds for the euro area and economic developments in his native Portugal. Ricardo's work is macroeconomics at its best: in contact with data, innovative and with lessons for policymakers. Please join me in congratulating Ricardo on being awarded this year's Bernacer Prize.

2977,r191114a_ECB,euro area,2019-11-14,The international transmission of monetary policy,lane,0,"It is a pleasure to speak at the annual meeting of the CEPR's International Macroeconomics and Finance (IMF) Programme, hosted this year here at the ECB. I briefly led this programme before my switch to central banking in 2015 and my aim in this speech is to explore some inter-connections between the research agenda of this programme's research agenda and the analytics of the monetary policy issues that occupy me in my current role. In particular, I wish to focus on the international transmission of the ECB's monetary policy, which is central to evaluating how our monetary policy affects both the euro area economy and, through various spillover mechanisms, the global economy. The euro area is deeply integrated into the global economy, which means that our analysis universally needs to take into account open-economy dimensions. The euro area contributes about 15 percent to global GDP and accounts for a similar share of global exports and imports. Furthermore, the participation of European firms in global value chains is substantial: even excluding intra-euro area trade, foreign value added as a percentage of gross exports amounts to as much as a fifth of gross exports. On the financial side, euro-denominated asset prices are heavily influenced by global factors, while the high volumes of external assets and liabilities held by euro area residents mean that the international balance sheet is quantitatively important in determining the impact of domestic and foreign shocks. In examining the international transmission of our monetary policy, I will focus on four dimensions: first, the external balance; second, the exchange rate; third, global liquidity conditions; and fourth, international financial flows. Chart 1 shows the evolution of the current account balance and the trade balance for the euro area. A striking feature is the sustained surplus position that has emerged in recent years. We know that low-frequency factors such as demographics contribute to this pattern (in addition to the role played by fiscal policy) but it is useful to explore whether our monetary policy has also played a role. In this regard, it is important to keep in mind that a monetary easing that is common to major regions across the world should leave the external balance largely unaffected, whereas an asymmetric monetary easing may affect the external balance. A priori, the overall effect of a monetary policy easing on the external balance is non-trivial. Along one dimension, if easier monetary policy raises domestic income, increased spending on imports will weaken the external balance. Along another dimension, if accommodative monetary policy generates a weaker exchange rate, this is expected to improve the trade balance (under typical calibrations). Of course, the timing and quantitative effects of exchange rate movements on macroeconomic outcomes depend on the microstructure of international trade. For instance, the currency of invoicing matters: under producer currency or dominant currency pricing, the trade balance improves due to expenditure switching effects; under local currency pricing, this occurs primarily through terms of trade effects. At the same time, the importance of the invoicing currency becomes less relevant at medium to long-term horizons, once firms adjust their markups and prices. Finally, exchange rate movements can also affect the current account balance through the revaluation of international income receipts and payments. Euro area current account balance and trade balance Turning to the empirical evidence, recent ECB staff analysis suggests that the net impact of a monetary policy expansion on the trade balance is positive. Chart 2 shows the effect of an unexpected accommodative monetary policy shock, which is identified using the high-frequency response of financial asset prices in the wake of ECB monetary policy decisions. The shock weakens the euro exchange rate; stimulates both euro area exports and imports; and generates a significant and persistent decline in the terms of trade. In net terms, the positive effects dominate: the response of exports is stronger than the increase in imports and the decline in the terms of trade. Impulse responses to an accommodative monetary policy shock - trade balance Notes: Trade in oil-related products and their respective prices are excluded from all applicable series. Estimates are obtained with a VAR(6) model on monthly observations over the period January 2000 to December 2018, including one-year Bund interest rates, euro area stock prices, corporate bond spreads, industrial production and consumer price indices where the monetary policy shock is identified using the high-frequency response of financial asset prices shortly after ECB monetary policy meetings in the spirit of Jarocinski, M. and Karadi, P. (2019), ""Deconstructing Monetary Policy Surprises - The Role of Information Shocks"", , forthcoming. The shock is re-scaled to correspond to a 25 basis point decline in the one-year Bund on impact. Let me now turn to a wider discussion about the interplay between our monetary policy and the dynamics of the euro exchange rate. Of course, the exchange rate is not a policy target for the ECB. Our monetary policy measures are solely geared towards ensuring convergence to our inflation aim over the medium term. Our internal model-based calculations suggest that only around a quarter of the fluctuations in the euro-dollar exchange rate since the summer of 2014 can be attributed to euro area monetary policy, while more than half of the variation reflects the evolution of US macro conditions as well as global risk factors (Chart 3). In analysing the effect of monetary policy on the exchange rate, it is worth bearing in mind that monetary policy measures that anchor the short end of the curve (such as the negative interest rate policy or forward guidance on the future rate path) may have different effects from measures that operate on term premia, such as the asset purchase programme (APP). The forward-iterated solution of the uncovered interest rate parity equation implies that the level of the exchange rate can be mechanically split between expectations about the future path of short-term interest rate differentials and currency risk premia. To the extent that the current and expected future path of short-term interest rate differentials quantitatively dominates currency risk premia, it follows that the exchange rate may react more strongly to news about the path of the short-term policy rate than to news about asset purchases that operate through the compression of term premia. In line with the predictions of uncovered interest rate parity, model-based analysis indeed confirms that the euro-US dollar exchange rate is much more reactive to ""rate expectations"" policy shocks such as rate cuts than to ""term premia"" policy shocks, such as those due to the APP. Model-based results indicate that the bilateral euro-US dollar exchange rate on average reacts more than twice as strongly to a monetary policy shock affecting rate expectations compared to a policy shock of similar size to the term premium (Chart 4). Similar results hold when using the effective exchange rate of the euro. Estimated effect on the EUR/USD exchange rate of a negative 10 basis point ""rate expectations"" vs. ""term premium"" monetary policy shock It is plausible that the impact of rate cuts on the euro exchange rate has intensified over time, especially since the deposit facility rate moved into negative territory in June 2014. Re-estimations of the model I just described over one-year time intervals indicate that the euro exchange rate has become increasingly sensitive to rate expectation shocks (Chart 5). After the introduction of the negative interest rate policy, the impact depreciation following a 10 basis point lowering of rate expectations has more than doubled compared with the rate cuts implemented in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. These findings are in line with a recent study that shows that the reaction of the exchange rate to monetary policy shocks becomes stronger when interest rates are lower (Ferrari et al. 2017). Time-varying effect on the EUR/USD exchange rate following a 10 basis point policy-induced decline in rate expectations While the evidence presented suggests that, for a given shock size, rate cuts have a larger exchange-rate effect than changes in term premia, the sheer scale of the APP means that the sharp decline in term premia has been an important driver of the euro exchange rate. In fact, according to the model, the cumulated negative impact of the term premium shock on the euro since mid-2014 is more than double the contribution of the rate expectation shock. This reflects the fact that term premia have declined much more than rate expectations since mid-2014. A role for term premia in influencing the euro exchange rate is in line with Dedola et al. (2019). These authors point to several transmission channels through which the APP has significantly affected the euro/US dollar exchange rate. At a basic level, there has been a clear correlation between changes in the relative balance sheet sizes of the ECB and the Federal Reserve and in the euro/US dollar exchange rate (Chart 6). The authors use announcements of quantitative easing (QE) type measures to predict future changes in the relative sizes of central bank balance sheets. In turn, they estimate the effects of these exogenous balance sheet changes on exchange rates - and other relevant asset prices - over time. The authors find that QE measures have had large and persistent effects on the euro exchange rate. Chart 7 (left side) shows the impulse response of the nominal US dollar-euro exchange rate to a relative QE shock that expands the ECB's balance sheet relative to that of the Federal Reserve by 1 percentage point over the following nine months using a sample of observations that starts during the global financial crisis in 2008. The euro immediately depreciates against the dollar, peaking at around 0.35 percent below baseline after nine months. The depreciation is quite persistent and statistically significant up to 18 months. Regarding the transmission channels, a QE shock that expands the ECB's balance sheet relative to that of the Federal Reserve works to a significant extent through the ""signalling channel"". It persistently reduces the euro/dollar short-term money market rate differentials and shifts market expectations regarding the timing of a lift-off further into the future (Chart 7, right side). The largest contribution, stems from the effects of QE on residual risk premia in foreign exchange markets, as is shown in Chart 8 (see the red bars). The substantial role of risk premia echoes the evidence from classic studies that a large share of the variation in the dollar exchange rate is attributable to this residual risk premium component. QE also exacerbates limits to arbitrage in foreign exchange markets, since it widens covered interest parity deviations reflected in the cross-currency basis, but not to an economically large extent. Decomposition of exchange rate response to a relative ECB-Federal Reserve QE shock The estimates of the effects of QE on the exchange rate remain fairly comparable with those of conventional monetary policy. A one percent increase in the ECB's balance sheet relative to that of the Federal Reserve leads to a of the euro relative to the dollar in the order of 0.35 percent which is broadly comparable with the exchange rate effect of an unanticipated two basis point decline in one-year interest rates in the euro area relative to those in the United States. This brings me to my next point as to whether our monetary policy actions have an impact on global liquidity. It is well established that US monetary policy is a key driver of the global financial cycle. At a qualitative level, there is similar evidence for the euro area: ECB monetary policy easing reverberates globally by spurring euro-denominated loans outside the euro area. For instance, Chart 9 shows that the growth of euro-denominated credit to borrowers outside the euro area has outpaced that of US-dollar-denominated credit to non-US borrowers in recent years. , Recent research by ECB staff suggests that our unconventional monetary policy measures, particularly the credit easing programmes, have played a role in supporting cross-border lending by euro area banks. In response to the ECB's accommodative monetary policy, euro area banks operating internationally have reallocated funds abroad within their respective banking organisations. In turn, the greater supply of euro-denominated funds outside the euro area has supported euro-denominated lending by banks outside the euro area. Currency composition of outstanding amounts of international loans in selected major currencies Turning from bank financing to bond financing, the impact of the ECB's non-standard measures on euro-denominated international bond issuance is limited, due to two offsetting effects. On the one side, an accommodative unconventional monetary policy shock leads to a decline in euro area interest rates, which tends to stimulate international bond issuance in euro. On the other side, such a shock amplifies deviations from covered interest parity - the premium demanded by market participants for taking on a foreign currency exposure over and beyond interest rate differentials. This deviation - also known as the cross-currency swap basis - determines the euro's attractiveness as an international funding currency for the synthetic issuance of US dollar bonds (in other words, issuing euro-denominated bonds and immediately swapping the euro proceeds on them for US dollars). A more negative basis increases the costs of synthetic US dollar funding through euro debt markets, which tends to discourage international bond issuance in euro. By and large, these two effects tend to offset each other, as suggested by the statistically insignificant response of international bond issuance in euro to a shock caused by the ECB's accommodative asset purchases. Let me now turn to the impact of our monetary policy on international financial flows. As documented in previous contributions by my colleague Benoit Coeure, the APP's introduction was followed by a striking swing from a sustained period of net portfolio flows into the euro area to sizeable net portfolio flows out of the euro area (Chart 10). Net portfolio outflows reached their peak in 2016, when the monthly pace of APP purchases was at its fastest, and then gradually receded, broadly in tandem with the successive reductions in the pace of monthly purchases until it reached zero at the end of 2018. The substantial net outflows observed during the previous APP net purchase phase were almost entirely accounted for by portfolio flows into long-dated foreign securities, which outstripped by a wide margin the continued net inflows into euro area equities. The ending of this phase of net purchases in December 2018 marks an important pivot in the data, with the convergence of net portfolio outflows to zero by the middle of 2019. Breakdown of euro area net portfolio investment flows Notes: A positive (negative) number indicates net outflows (inflows) from (into) the euro area. Equity includes investment fund shares. APP stands for asset purchase programme. Euro area investors contributed sizeably to the net portfolio outflows by investing heavily in long-term foreign fixed income securities during the APP period (Chart 11). Euro area investors rebalanced their portfolios particularly towards sovereign bonds issued by other advanced economies, most notably US Treasuries, but also sovereign bonds of other jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom and Japan (Chart 12). This type of investment strategy was notably carried out by euro area investment funds through which households channelled their rebalancing from domestic into overseas debt securities. Since the end of net asset purchases at the end of December 2018, flows into non-euro area bonds have become mainly restricted to those issued in the United States, while flows into the United Kingdom, Japan and other jurisdictions have largely evaporated. Euro area portfolio investment abroad Notes: A positive (negative) number indicates net purchases (sales) of non-euro area securities by euro area investors. Equity includes investment fund shares. APP stands for asset purchase programme. Geographical breakdown of euro area investors' net purchases of non-euro area debt securities (percentage of euro area GDP; four-quarter moving averages) Non-euro area investors have also been a driving force behind the overall net outflows in portfolio investment though net sales of euro area government debt securities (Chart 13). These net sales have been another key feature of euro area financial flows since the APP's launch, mainly reflecting the important role of non-residents as counterparties to the Eurosystem in the APP's implementation. In contrast, 2019 has seen a different profile, with the end of net purchases under the APP correlated with the resumption of net buying of long-term debt securities by foreign investors. Foreign portfolio investment in the euro area Notes: A positive (negative) number indicates net purchases (sales) of euro area securities by non-euro area investors. Equity includes investment fund shares. APP stands for asset purchase programme. More generally, it is remarkable how closely cross-border portfolio flows have tracked the amount of bonds that were eligible for purchase under the public sector purchase programme (PSPP) but that were not absorbed by it (Chart 14). This suggests that the degree to which investors - both from the euro area and abroad - were rebalancing their portfolios from euro area to foreign sovereign paper was significantly driven by the availability of euro area bonds (net of the purchasing requirements of the Eurosystem under the APP). Net portfolio investment in the euro area Notes: Assets (and therefore also net amounts) of portfolio investment are displayed with negative sign in order to match the related monetary flows. PSPP stands for public sector purchase programme. Additional insight into the dynamics of international financial flows can be gained from viewing international portfolio flows through the lens of monetary arithmetic. Chart 15 shows how the APP became the dominant source of money creation in the euro area during the previous phase of net asset purchases. M3 growth had fallen close to zero by 2013 (as loan growth became negative in large parts of the euro area), but the APP injected fresh liquidity into the system, since the Eurosystem paid for the securities purchased under the programme by creating reserves and deposits. While, at that point, the swing towards net monetary outflows to the rest of the world (measured by the decline in the banking sector's net external asset position) tempered the growth rate of broad money, these dynamics went into reverse when the exogenous impulse to money creation from APP net purchases began to fade. In particular, the increase in the net external asset position of the banking sector has supported domestic broad money growth in recent months. The role of cross-border flows in monetary dynamics Changes in the net external asset position of euro area MFIs reflects monetary exchanges with the rest of the world, the dynamics of which has been driven in recent years by the net portfolio outflows that I have described, as can be seen in the monetary presentation of the balance of payments. By construction, this perspective abstracts from the banking sector's autonomous actions. Nonetheless, the net external asset position of the banking sector reflects their roles as intermediaries in cross-border payments and as issuers of the bank deposits that form the main instruments for international payments. In this way, the monetary presentation of the balance of payments illustrates that external monetary inflows and outflows over the last decade have stemmed mainly from two types of cross-border activity: first, transactions of a financial origin (dominated by international portfolio flows) and, second, the proceeds from the significant current account surplus (Chart 16). In fact, this sizeable surplus represents a persistent source of monetary inflows that has tempered the impact of APP-induced portfolio outflows on euro area monetary dynamics. The monetary presentation of the balance of payments Finally, a central question in assessing the impact of our asset purchase programmes is the mechanics of international portfolio adjustment. Let me look again at the effects of asset purchases in the presence of portfolio rebalancing frictions, based on simulations of two open-economy models. In the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models considered here, asset purchases in the domestic economy drive down yields of domestic long-term government bonds and incentivise portfolio rebalancing. In particular, the strength of the exchange rate effect in the models depends on portfolio rebalancing frictions that operate both through a credit channel (whereby banks sell bonds to the central bank and originate more/cheaper credit) as well as an exchange rate channel (whereby the rest of the world adjusts its portfolio position vis-a-vis the euro area, contributing to exchange rate depreciation). The model simulations indicate that global portfolio rebalancing is an important channel through which an asset purchase programme stimulates the domestic economy and that its presence can influence the evolution of the trade balance. In particular, the impact of portfolio rebalancing on the exchange rate is quite powerful in reinforcing the strength of monetary policy stimulus imparted by asset purchases. This results in a larger impact on GDP (Chart 17) and a more positive response of the trade balance (Chart 18). Finally, according to the models, global portfolio rebalancing is more important for the transmission of an asset purchase programme than for the transmission of an interest rate shock. For example, results from the NAWM II show that the transmission of a domestic interest rate shock is largely invariant to global portfolio rebalancing frictions. The effects of global portfolio rebalancing on GDP - evidence from DSGE models The effects of global portfolio rebalancing on trade balance - evidence from DSGE models In this speech I have focused on the international dimensions of the transmission of our monetary policy. Given the open nature of the euro area economy, cross-border channels are crucial in evaluating how our policy stance affects the euro area, while also influencing global economic and financial conditions. One lesson from recent years is that since our various policy measures (the short-term policy rate; the asset purchase programme; our credit-easing measures) work through quite different cross-border channels, it is important to consider the specific design of our monetary policy packages when tracing out the international transmission of monetary policy. A second lesson is that the responses of exchange rates and international financial flows to monetary policy innovations have shifted over time, especially in the light of the differences between ""traditional"" macro-financial environments and the current environment in which short-term policy rates are either low or negative and central bank balance sheets have expanded so much. Accordingly, there is a rich and challenging research agenda in international monetary economics and I look forward to the advances that will be made by the researchers in the CEPR's IMF programme.","['euro', 'macroeconomics', 'macroeconomic', 'eurosystem', 'currencies']","['economy euro', 'influencing euro', 'effects euro', 'flows euro', 'affects euro']","['global economy euro', 'euro area monetary', 'euro area economy', 'economy euro area', 'euro area gdp']"
3101,r210325a_ECB,euro area,2021-03-25,Paving the path to recovery by preserving favourable financing conditions ,schnabel,0,"For more than a year now, central banks worldwide have been tackling the fallout from the coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis with unprecedented measures. The pandemic has posed enormous challenges to monetary policy, which have varied over time. The first phase of the crisis caused severe dislocations in global financial markets. Liquidity dried up, asset prices plunged and markets became fragmented, causing a broad-based flight to the safest assets in what became known as a ""dash for cash"". By offering to purchase large amounts of securities, central banks succeeded in restoring orderly trading conditions. In the euro area, we established the pandemic emergency purchase programme, the PEPP, under which we bought assets worth more than EUR200 billion over a period of just two months. In doing so, we prevented the public health crisis from turning into a full-blown financial crisis, a risk that was particularly acute in the euro area. Concerns about the impact of the pandemic on public finances caused a wide divergence in the borrowing conditions for euro area sovereigns, impairing the transmission of our monetary policy. The PEPP immediately instilled confidence in financial markets and succeeded in reducing fragmentation. This was reinforced, in a strong act of European solidarity, by the agreement on the EU Recovery and Resilience Facility. However, restoring financial market stability did not remove the risks to our primary mandate of price stability. As the rise in infection numbers in Europe began to accelerate again after the summer and the risks of a second wave materialised, the economic and inflation outlook in the euro area deteriorated notably. Just when the outlook was at its darkest, news of the imminent arrival of multiple vaccines brought the long-awaited light at the end of the tunnel. The sources of uncertainty then shifted from the crisis can be contained to we can expect a return to normality. The December staff macroeconomic projections suggested that this path could still be long and bumpy. Consumer price inflation was projected to reach no more than 1.4% in 2023, well short of our medium-term aim of below, but close to, 2%. Beyond the near-term damage that the pandemic was inflicting on the economy, economic slack was expected to weigh on price pressures for a considerable period of time. Further decisive monetary policy support was needed to offset the effect of the pandemic on the projected path of inflation, in line with our mandate. The question facing the ECB's Governing Council at its meeting on 10 December 2020 was how to best provide this support. Our policy response needed to take two factors into account. One was that the unprecedented fiscal and monetary policy support had succeeded in delivering highly favourable financing conditions. The nominal euro area GDP-weighted yield curve stood at its lowest ever recorded level (left chart, slide 2). Yields up to a maturity of ten years were in deep negative territory. Real long-term expected risk-free interest rates stood at around -1.5%, close to the lowest level ever recorded in the euro area (right chart, slide 2). Bank lending rates, which are the rates that matter most for households and small and medium-sized enterprises, were also at historical lows. The other factor was that large uncertainty, risk aversion and wide-ranging mobility restrictions meant that a significant part of the economy was unlikely to be able, or willing, to take advantage of these financing conditions in the near term, delaying the effect of monetary accommodation on aggregate demand. Surveys suggested that a large share of households did not plan to make major purchases over the next 12 months (left chart, slide 3). Their savings intentions remained at historically high levels as uncertainty continued to weigh on sentiment and consumption opportunities remained restricted amid renewed containment measures (right chart, slide 3). In other words, there was a substantial degree of monetary accommodation that, if preserved, could be expected to provide a measurable boost to aggregate demand and underlying price pressures. The Governing Council responded to these conditions with a powerful commitment to preserve favourable financing conditions. Two main characteristics distinguish this policy from the way asset purchases had been conducted before. The first is a departure from a policy that attempts to push interest rates even lower. The effectiveness of monetary policy is highly state-contingent. The benefits from reducing interest rates further from very low levels may still outweigh the costs in certain circumstances. And since we are not yet at the effective lower bound, such actions remain possible in the future. But when uncertainty is large and private demand constrained, monetary policy is like ""pushing on a string"". Pushing harder in such circumstances would likely have limited effects. In addition, a growing body of evidence suggests that the potential benefits of pushing rates lower may diminish even when uncertainty fades. The central idea behind lowering interest rates is to provide incentives to bring forward consumption and investment. But when rates have been low for a long time, fewer and fewer firms and households are left to respond to an additional monetary policy impulse, in particular when investment and durable goods demand are both ""lumpy"" and infrequent, as a large body of evidence suggests. One way of looking at this is to consider the share of new variable short-term loans for house purchases (left chart, slide 4). This share has fallen visibly in the euro area as many borrowers have already renegotiated their mortgages to lock in more favourable rates, potentially dampening the sensitivity of credit demand to lower rates. These effects may be amplified if the pass-through of market and policy rates to bank lending and deposit rates weakens or slows in the vicinity of the effective lower bound (right chart, slide 4), or if a flatter yield curve reduces banks' incentives to undertake maturity transformation. Lowering interest rates further from very low levels may not only result in diminishing returns, it may also come with increasing costs. A case in point is financial stability risk. Years of monetary stimulus have made asset price valuations highly sensitive to changes in interest rates. In the United States, for example, the yield that investors currently earn in excess of a real ten-year US government bond yield has fallen measurably (left chart, slide 5). In the euro area, signs of overvaluation are increasingly visible in real estate markets (right chart, slide 5). Hence, the harder we push today, the larger the potential risks may be for price stability tomorrow. In such circumstances, monetary policy can best support the economy by ensuring that favourable financing conditions prevail for as long as needed. The second characteristic is the way we deliver on our commitment to preserve favourable financing conditions. Rather than absorbing assets at a constant pace, we purchase flexibly according to market conditions. We buy more when financing conditions are becoming less favourable, and we buy less when they are stable or improving. This flexibility helps increase the efficiency of our purchases. In other words, our pledge to preserve favourable financing conditions shifts the focus from quantities - the amount of assets we purchase - towards prices - the conditions at which sovereigns, firms and households can access credit. During the first phase of the crisis, quantities were an end in themselves. They were necessary to restore market functioning and bring about appropriately accommodative financing conditions. Today, they are a means to an end: they are used to the extent necessary to deliver on our commitment to preserve favourable financing conditions. How, then, can this policy be implemented in practice? And what is the reaction function? Markets will be able to better anticipate our actions if they understand which movements in market prices are likely to be considered favourable and which ones are not. And the better investors internalise our policy, the larger the potential efficiency gains will be. Let me start by recalling two fundamental principles of monetary policy. One is that interest rates affect consumption and investment decisions. In themselves, interest rates typically have little bearing on the behaviour of firms and households. And since higher nominal rates can go hand-in-hand with higher growth and higher actual inflation in the future, they are not a good indicator of the degree of monetary policy accommodation. The other principle is that the favourability of financing conditions is a relative concept. Historically low real interest rates do not necessarily imply that the degree of stimulus is historical too. The latter crucially depends on how real interest rates compare to real equilibrium rates - that is, those rates that are consistent with a stable rate of inflation. Monetary policy is only accommodative if actual real rates fall below these equilibrium rates. Conversely, an increase in real interest rates is not necessarily a sign that financing conditions are becoming less favourable. For example, as the economy recovers, real and nominal long-term rates will gradually rise in tandem with the real equilibrium rate. Monetary policy will not tighten in this case. It will retain the same level of accommodation as the gap between the actual real rate and the equilibrium rate remains unchanged. These considerations are what distinguishes a policy of preserving favourable financing conditions from yield curve control. The latter targets a fixed level of nominal yields with a view to increasing, rather than preserving, the degree of monetary accommodation. This would not be consistent with the considerations I outlined above: it would mean that real rates were not sufficiently accommodative to begin with, and that lower real rates come at no cost. To see this more clearly, it is useful to look at current estimates of the real interest rate gap. Until a few years ago, policymakers mostly focused on the real interest rate gap. But this exclusive focus is no longer appropriate in a world where central banks increasingly try to influence long-term interest rates through forward guidance and asset purchases. The real interest rate gap has become equally important over time. Although there is considerable uncertainty regarding real equilibrium rates, let alone their term structure, ECB staff estimates suggest that the gap between the actual real ten-year rate and the estimated real ten-year equilibrium rate is likely to be highly significant, even when accounting for model uncertainty (left chart, slide 6). Monetary policy has thus managed to remain highly accommodative despite the steady decline in equilibrium rates over time (right chart, slide 6). A policy that commits to preserving such a degree of accommodation provides measurable support to aggregate demand and hence underlying price pressure. There are, however, instances where rising rates would unduly tighten our policy stance. For example, a rise in the real term premium - that is, the compensation that investors demand for risks related to the future path of real short-term interest rates - could signal growing uncertainty around the monetary policy outlook or indigestion of duration supply. A rising real term premium was the main reason behind the sharp uptick in bond yields seen during the 2013 taper tantrum in the United States and in March last year (left and middle panel, slide 7). These types of movement, if sizeable and persistent, make financing conditions less favourable as they are not accompanied by a corresponding increase in real equilibrium rates. This channel seems to have played less of a role in recent weeks (right panel, slide 7) but we are conscious of the fact that it may well affect financing conditions in the current environment. The reason for this is that protecting society from the appalling consequences of the pandemic will require continued strong fiscal support, and hence high net public debt issuance, resulting in an increase in duration risk to be absorbed by markets (left chart, slide 8). This could put unwarranted upward pressure on the real term premium over the period of net asset purchases (right chart, slide 8). A firm commitment to favourable financing conditions therefore requires a certain minimum purchase volume to offset this effect on real interest rates. Rising rates are also a concern if the market is driven by animal spirits - if investors start to price in a strong recovery, albeit one that is still subject to considerable uncertainty - or if rates increase as a result of global spillover effects. Such price dynamics risk increasing volatility and uncertainty and could result in vital policy support being withdrawn prematurely. Preserving favourable financing conditions therefore puts the drivers of changes in financing conditions, and their speed of adjustment, into the focus of our assessment. In this assessment, cross-asset price correlations can help identify and interpret potential changes in real interest rates. For example, if stock markets increase and credit spreads tighten in response to a rise in real interest rates, markets are likely to price in a stronger growth outlook that could leave financing conditions favourable. In addition, changes in market-based financing conditions have to be assessed jointly with the likely future trajectory of the economy, in particular the inflation outlook. The Governing Council meetings in which we discuss the quarterly ECB/Eurosystem staff projections have an important role here. But it is important to note that this does not limit our flexibility to adjust purchase volumes in the period between meetings. If market conditions require, the pace and composition of purchases can be flexibly adjusted in both directions at any time. Between the December decision and our most recent Governing Council monetary policy meeting on 11 March, we saw a rapid increase in global and euro area nominal interest rates. How should these changes in financing conditions be assessed? The factors that have caused a rise in risk-free interest rates have been largely benign in the euro area. At the time of our meeting, nominal ten-year overnight index swap (OIS) rates were up by about 30 basis points, entirely reflecting a rise in the inflation component (left chart, slide 9). These movements should not be seen as reflecting a genuine reappraisal of the expected future path of inflation. Term structure models suggest that much of the recent rise in nominal ten-year OIS rates reflects an increase in term premia which, in turn, likely reflects a rise in the inflation risk premium (right chart, slide 9). In other words, markets have started to revise the balance of risks around the medium-term inflation outlook. After a long period in which inflation persistently and repeatedly surprised to the downside, markets no longer exclude the risk that inflation may rise more strongly than previously expected. There are a number of reasons why investors might think this way. One is that accumulated excess savings resulting from a lack of spending opportunities are large enough to meaningfully affect the trajectory of the economy in the medium term (left chart, slide 10). It is difficult to predict what portion of these savings will end up being spent. It is also unclear how firms will adjust their profit margins to make up for lost income and higher leverage. Before the pandemic, profit margins were a key contributor to weak inflation by absorbing cost-push pressures. But the pass-through of higher input prices - for example for oil and copper - to final consumer prices may change in an environment of weaker balance sheets, supply bottlenecks and large pent-up demand (right chart, slide 10). Yet, rising nominal rates have not been accompanied by a rise in real rates. Real ten-year yields fluctuated over the period but have returned to their December levels, thereby protecting the prevailing high degree of accommodation. Real rates up to a maturity of five years have even continued to reach new historical lows in recent weeks (left chart, slide 11). The stability of real interest rates is likely to have reflected a combination of two factors. First, the PEPP's calendar-based forward guidance, promising net asset purchases until at least March 2022, has allayed fears of early tapering in the euro area, keeping the real term premium anchored at very low levels, supported by our continued net asset purchases. Second, the near-term growth outlook for the euro area remains highly uncertain and clouded. Large parts of the euro area economy remain paralysed. Vaccination campaigns are progressing slowly, infection numbers are rising and containment measures are stricter than in other parts of the world. This interpretation is consistent with the picture painted by the latest ECB staff macroeconomic projections, which foresee an economic and inflation outlook that is largely unchanged from the December 2020 projections. While the risks surrounding the growth outlook over the medium term have become more balanced, downside risks remain in the near term, mainly owing to the rapid spread of virus mutations. In the light of these risks, the speed of adjustment of nominal yields was considered to pose a threat to the recovery. There was a risk that markets were getting ahead of themselves. Movements in financial markets had become disorderly at times, increasing volatility and thus uncertainty. The risk of an overly abrupt and premature withdrawal of vital policy support was corroborated by model-based evidence that suggests that a significant part of the rise in ten-year OIS rates reflected global spillovers (right chart, slide 11). Against this backdrop, the Governing Council announced that we would significantly step up purchases under the PEPP in the second quarter, in line with market conditions. Let me conclude. Preserving favourable financing conditions is a powerful policy response to the challenges we are currently facing. It is a strong commitment to protect an exceptional degree of policy accommodation for as long as needed. It signals our unwavering determination to offset the impact of the pandemic on the projected inflation path. And it is a promise to the people of Europe that the ECB will do its part to mitigate the social and economic costs of this crisis. This promise is underpinned by a purchase envelope that is unprecedented in the history of the ECB. We will continue to deploy this envelope resolutely and efficiently, guided by our commitment to price stability. If favourable financing conditions can be maintained with asset purchase flows that do not exhaust the envelope over the net purchase horizon of the PEPP, the envelope need not be used in full. Equally, the envelope can be recalibrated if required to maintain favourable financing conditions to help counter the negative pandemic shock to the path of inflation. We will flexibly adjust our purchases over time and across asset classes and jurisdictions in a way that ensures favourable financing conditions for the entire economy and paves the path to recovery.

3132,r210924a_ECB,euro area,2021-09-24,Structural change and central banking: some research priorities,lane,0,"Structural changes (especially digitalisation and the carbon transition) can be expected to be highly influential in driving macroeconomic outcomes over the next decade and are of first-order importance for central banks. In the European context, public policy is firmly geared to promoting a smooth and comprehensive digital and green transformation of the European economy, including through the design and funding of the Next Generation EU (NGEU) programme. In the spirit of a research seminar, my aim today is to outline some issues that call for further research - both inside policy institutions (including central banks) and in academia. These secular forces are intertwined. In particular, digitalisation can do much to facilitate a lower-carbon economic model, while shifts in global patterns of energy consumption are clearly influenced by the power needs of different strands of the digital economy. A wide variety of modelling and analytical approaches are required to gain the necessary comprehensive understanding of the economic, financial and social impact of these structural changes, including the interaction effects between digitalisation and the carbon transition. Digitalisation and the greening of the economy require significant levels of investment, both from the private sector and the public sector. In addition, public transfers and subsidies will be required to ensure an inclusive approach. The funding of digitalisation and the carbon transition poses significant challenges for the financial system, the tax system and the public finances. While these funding decisions will be heavily influenced by political economy considerations, the design of optimal funding schemes remains a high research priority. For central banks, it is essential to monitor these underlying structural changes and assess the implications for economic growth and inflation dynamics along both cyclical and trend dimensions. The direct and indirect effects of digitalisation and the carbon transition on the financial system and the drivers of the equilibrium real interest rate also warrant intensive study, especially in view of the possible implications for the monetary transmission mechanism. In particular, the net impact of these structural changes requires a full-scale, intertemporal general equilibrium approach: shorter-run and longer-run forces may work in opposite directions, while the nature of the impact on the supply side of the economy needs to be assessed jointly with the implications for the various components of aggregate expenditure: public and private consumption, public and private investment and export and import dynamics. From a central banking perspective, the uncertainties associated with structural change reinforce the value of a stability-oriented approach to the conduct of monetary policy. In particular, a clear anchor for monetary policy allows households, firms and governments to concentrate on the many challenges associated with digitalisation and the carbon transition, secure in the knowledge that monetary policy will be guided by a clear and predictable framework that, in the case of the ECB, is oriented towards stabilising inflation at two percent over the medium term. Although the precise design and calibration of our policy instruments will surely be influenced by these structural forces in the coming years, the policy goal will remain the same: protecting price stability by focusing on the symmetric two percent inflation target. In turn, our recent comprehensive strategy review has given us very strong foundations for ensuring that the conduct of monetary policy will take into account the economic, monetary and financial implications of digitalisation and the carbon transition.","['digitalisation', 'macroeconomic', 'economic', 'economy', 'digital']","['funding digitalisation', 'digitalisation carbon', 'digitalisation greening', 'carbon economic', 'digital economy']","['funding digitalisation carbon', 'digitalisation greening economy', 'implications digitalisation carbon', 'digitalisation carbon transition', 'carbon transition digitalisation']"
3350,r041013a_BOJ,japan,2004-10-13,Global Imbalances and Exchanges ,no_info,0,"Ladies and gentlemen, it is an honor as well as a pleasure to be invited to the annual meeting of the World Federation of Exchanges, to offer some thoughts on recent developments in the international financial system. Taking this opportunity, I would like to congratulate you on the tremendous success exchanges around the world are achieving in promoting trading of various financial instruments, and on the role your association has played in facilitating such developments. Today, having just chaired this month's first Monetary Policy Meeting, I would like to briefly comment on the monetary policy of the Bank of Japan. The Japanese economy continues to recover steadily, but mild deflation persists, reflecting factors such as increasing productivity. Against this background, the Bank of Japan decided to maintain the so-called ""quantitative easing"" framework. For the rest of the evening, I would like to focus on a medium term structural issue that never seems to go away--global imbalances, and offer my views on what role exchanges will be able to play in meeting this challenge. Let me begin by briefly laying out how unbalanced the world is. At the beginning of this month, I attended a series of meetings in Washington. Those meetings were held in conjunction with the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group, and included the meeting of the finance ministers and central bank governors of the Group of Seven countries. A common theme running through those meetings was surprisingly robust growth in 2004. The global economy is expected to grow by 5% this year, which is the highest growth in 30 years. The above-potential growth would probably have to slow down next year, but the estimate given in the World Economic Outlook by the International Monetary Fund is 4.3%, still somewhat higher than the potential. Against this relatively favorable outlook, we have identified some risks. After all, central bank governors are paid to worry. One risk is obviously the high prices of oil. I will not go into details of this issue today, because so much is written about it. Another risk is global imbalances. The current account deficit of the United States reached 542 billion dollars last year. This is almost 5% of the nominal GDP of the United States. For this year, we have seen no sign of this deficit shrinking to any significant extent. If we look back to the middle of the 1980's, the last time global imbalances were considered to be a problem of the world economy, the current account deficit of the United States peaked at 3.5% of GDP. Looking at the details, however, there are some interesting differences between 2004 and the middle of the 1980's. First is the size of the imbalances, which I have just mentioned. The second is who are in the deficit club. In the mid-eighties, not only the United States but also many other countries were running deficits. On the other hand, today, most of the deficits are concentrated in the external account of the United States. Third, related to the point I have just mentioned, the emerging Asian economies are now in the black instead of being in the red. Having said this, I must make this clear: I am not saying that imbalances per se are bad. As a matter of simple arithmetic, if there were no trade in the first place, there would be no imbalances. When we start trading, unless everyone is balanced, imbalances are inevitable. We are certainly better off trading than not. More conceptually, an economy with abundant investment opportunities relative to its savings, most notably a developing economy, is likely to run a deficit. In this sense, some imbalances are a reflection of enhanced economic welfare. Furthermore, the size of the imbalances is not necessarily disruptive, either. At present, the United States is financing a current account shortfall amounting to 542 billion dollars, the size of the economy of Netherlands, with no visible difficulties. You may perhaps remember the concerns voiced in the market some twelve months ago. There were worries that the U.S. dollar might fall sharply, were it not for continued and heavy currency market interventions by Asian monetary authorities. That has not been the case so far. In the case of the yen, even in the absence of official interventions in the foreign exchange market since mid-March, the dollar has held up well against the yen. This suggests that private capital flows are now playing a more important role in determining market dynamics. I might even say that we should be proud of ourselves in allowing the international financial markets to develop into such a resilient system. If this is so, why are we saying that global imbalances risk the stability of the international financial system and the global economy? Large imbalances are worrisome, because imbalances cannot grow forever. In fact, the imbalances we saw in the middle of the 1980's led to a rather painful correction of the dollar. As one accumulates more dollars, he or she would begin to worry about the danger of putting all his or her eggs in one basket. Alternatives are there. It can be the euro, the yen or any other currency or a physical asset. If sentiment shifts suddenly in such an environment, there would be a rush to convert dollars into alternative assets. With the large accumulation of deficits to start with, the resulting flows could be quite large. They might be of a magnitude that could impair the smooth functioning of the international financial system. Though unlikely, that is still a risk we must not ignore. In order to reduce such risks, we must think about how to adjust the imbalances to more comfortable and manageable levels. Policy makers cannot adopt benign neglect in this context. I believe many things are best left to the market and the government should keep out of its way. We cannot, however, always say that the market would take care of itself. If left to the market, there is a risk, however remote, of a sudden shift in sentiment over the dollar. Policy makers must reassure the market that they are not letting imbalances get out of hand. We need to have a good mix of policies. To begin with, we need to ensure flexibility in the financial system and the economy. In many cases, unleashing market forces is a key to efficient adjustment, and flexibility is essential to the financial system and the economy to withstand shocks arising from adjustments. Beyond this, there are basically two routes to reach a level of imbalances that would be more comfortable and manageable in the long run: realigning exchange rates and rethinking policies that influence absorption in economies. Adjusting imbalances entirely through exchange rate realignments is neither practical nor desirable. Meanwhile, policy choices can influence absorption. If dissavings by the government are resulting in current account deficits, consolidation of fiscal expenditure would be necessary. Governments of deficit-running economies might also review any policies that are discouraging private savings or adopt policies that encourage private savings. Surplus-running economies can adopt policies to encourage domestic absorption. For example, enhancing confidence in social security systems would persuade households to avoid excessive savings. It is responsibility of policy makers to formulate and implement an appropriate mix of policies. Adjusting imbalances, however, is easier said than done. The United States now imports 50% more than it exports. If imports are to grow by 5% per year, exports must grow by 7.5% just to keep the dollar amount of current account deficits at present levels. Viewing from a slightly different angle, even if the income elasticity of U.S. imports to U.S. demand growth were to suddenly drop to zero while exports continued to grow at 5%, it would take nearly 5 years before the deficit halved. How then could we realize this significant adjustment? What should Asian economies, which are running surpluses, do in the context of global imbalances? First of all, economies should, in principle, accept adjustment through market forces. Rigidity can lead to a build-up of stress in the system. Many words have already been spent on this subject, and I will not repeat them. I would just note that, in our recent meetings with central bank colleagues from Asia, they were fully aware of the need for flexibility and the challenges facing them in pursuing that goal. In addition to enhancing flexibility, today I would like to explore another option: the possibility of Asian economies enhancing absorption in their economies. For Japan, demography would aid the adjustment process. Academic literature tells us that the rate of savings tends to decline in an aging society. In our case, as baby-boomers begin to retire in the next few years, they would start drawing down their savings. This should gradually influence the overall rate of savings and hence the level of external surplus. In this context, one important element would be rebuilding confidence in the social security systems that are now under pressure from the rapid aging of the population. In many non-Japan Asian economies, the government does not provide a sufficient social safety net. This is one area where a quick action is needed. In a financial context, one challenge is to explore a better use of capital. Emerging Asia collectively earns about 150 billion dollars a year in surpluses. These dollars are often invested in the United States. Meanwhile, as developing economies, emerging Asia has an almost insatiable appetite for capital. There are still numerous investment opportunities out there in the region. Today, these ventures are often financed by overseas investors, often from the United States. At a risk of oversimplification, I would say that dollars earned by emerging Asia are invested in the United States, which are, in turn invested in emerging Asia. We should ask if there are better ways for capital to flow. Having put this question on the table, let me spend a few minutes on investment opportunities in emerging Asia. Emerging Asia has a huge population. China alone has 1.3 billion people. If one adds India with 1.1 billion, there are almost three billion people in the region. These people are not just inexpensive sources of labor for goods and services exported to markets in industrialized economies. These people will become happier if they enjoy material wealth like we do. You can see vending machines virtually at every corner in Tokyo, peddling one-dollar cans and bottles of soft drinks. If the three billion people in emerging Asia can each drink just one can or bottle a day, the sales add up to three billion dollars. In a year, it will become more than one trillion dollars. To put this into perspective, the annual revenue of the Coca-Cola Company was 21 billion dollars in 2003. Of course, this is not yet a plausible story because many of these people are living on just a couple of dollars a day. For example, 3 dollars in China, 2.6 dollars in Indonesia and 1.5 dollars in India. Today, not every one can afford to spend one dollar for the pleasure of drinking a refreshing can of soft drink. However, if jobs are created for these people, huge untapped demand could be unleashed. Workers are at the same time consumers. Investments in goods and services targeted for intra-regional consumption can create jobs and, in turn, the market for those goods and services. If and when this happens, domestic absorption will increase in emerging Asia. Global imbalances will be alleviated. This scenario is not a pipe dream. In many parts of emerging Asia, consumer demand is picking up. From Myondong in Seoul to Nanjin Lu in Shanghai to Siam Square in Bangkok, consumers are flocking to fashionable shops and cafes. This demand is creating a favorable cycle by creating new jobs and hence greater consumer demand. For this model to work, however, a thorough understanding of the region and the needs of the people is essential. The deepening of regional integration will, I hope, give birth to a new breed of intra-regional investors, who will focus on these opportunities. In connection with this scenario, an interesting question is how to finance the efforts of the region's entrepreneurs. A key issue here is how can we mobilize the region's rich reservoir of savings to finance regional investments. Financial institutions in this region must enhance their ability to intermediate between savings and investments. I also find it important to strengthen the financial infrastructure of the region. There are many important initiatives now underway. Since I have recently had a chance to explain them, I will not repeat them here. I would just like to draw your attention to ongoing efforts, such as the launch of the Asian Bond Fund by EMEAP central banks and the Asian Bond Market Initiative by ASEAN+3 countries. These efforts attempt to become catalysts for developing the bond market in the east Asian region, which still remains in an infant stage. In the case of the Asian Bond Fund, the seed money provided by central banks ought to strengthen confidence among investors contemplating to enter the market. Let me now turn to possible roles that exchanges can play in this world with imbalances. You know more than I do that exchanges are important channels to distribute funds for various investment opportunities. Exchanges facilitate the flow of funds in the market. Since financial markets are interconnected, efficiency gains accorded by exchanges contributed to the expansion of global capital flows. In this regard, exchanges are part of the international financial system that helps finance global imbalances. Before moving on, I would like to discuss one important efficiency-enhancing feature of exchanges. Exchanges are highly transparent form of connecting sellers and buyers of financial assets. In the over-the-counter market, a seller must search for buyers. The seller does not know precisely at what price the asset traded. The seller does not have an idea of the depth or the liquidity of the market. Exchanges bring together sellers and buyers in one place to maximize the chance of a seller finding a buyer. Prices are available and the distribution of bids and offers could also be seen in some cases. In short, exchanges facilitate the trade matching process through its transparency. Exchanges can also be a mitigating factor of imbalances. In the context of Asian economies, one should look at a common structural problem in the domestic financial systems of emerging Asian economies. In these countries, much financing still moves through the banking channel. Strengthening of capital markets is therefore a common goal. The initiatives related to the bond market, which I referred to a few moments ago, should be seen in this light. Exchanges can play a role here as well. Providing a full range of financing options to entrepreneurs is a key element in the mobilization of the region's rich reservoir of savings to finance regional investments. Another contribution that can be made by exchanges is enhanced transparency. In some cases, investors are said to be discouraged from investing in the emerging Asian market, partly because transparency is so low. With their transparent trading systems, which I have just mentioned, exchanges may help overcome this problem. Finally, exchanges could be linked across borders. Such linkages would create additional efficiency. In the context of emerging Asia, it is important to strengthen the intra-regional as well as extra-regional linkages between exchanges. Listing of overseas assets, cross-listing of products and trading links between exchanges can all be designed to enhance intra-regional capital flows. I hope the distinguished leaders of established exchanges assembled here today would assist their emerging Asian colleagues to achieve these goals. Central banks operate in the markets to achieve its policy goals. As a result, the effectiveness of monetary policy depends on the sound development of financial markets. In this context, central banks have more than a passing interest in enhancing market infrastructure. Exchanges are important building blocks of this infrastructure. I should stress that in a globalizing world supported by information technology, the certainty of transactions is a crucial factor for sound development of the financial system. Central banks provide certainty through the finality of payments effected through their accounts. Exchanges provide certainty through its settlement arrangements. In light of these common roles, I believe that we can cooperate in many ways to enhance the efficiency and soundness of the financial system. I look forward to working together with you in this regard. Thank you for your kind attention, and good evening.","['currency', 'exchanges', 'monetary', 'yen', 'exchange']","['international monetary', 'quantitative easing', 'bank japan', 'asian monetary', 'international financial']","['meetings international monetary', 'outlook international monetary', 'international monetary fund', 'exchanges international financial', 'monetary fund world']"
3395,r061127a_BOJ,japan,2006-11-27,"Summary of a Speech Given by Toshihiko Fukui, Governor of the Bank of Japan, at a Meeting with Business Leaders in Osaka on November 27, 2006",fukui,1,"Today I will explain the Bank of Japan's view regarding recent developments in economic activity and prices and the basic thinking behind its conduct of monetary policy. In addition, I will touch upon the issues facing Japan's financial system. Japan's economy has been expanding moderately. The current phase of economic recovery began in January 2002. By the end of November, the economy will have experienced a long economic expansion that has lasted for four years and ten months. This sustained period of economic expansion is likely to continue. Recent economic indicators have shown mixed developments. For example, while the results of the and machinery orders were weak, the preliminary estimate of real GDP growth turned out to exceed market expectations, recording 2.0 percent in the July-September quarter on an annualized quarter-on-quarter basis. These mixed results seem to have introduced some volatility into market participants' view of the current economic situation. The important point at this juncture is to examine whether these indicators as a whole suggest any changes in the fundamental mechanisms underlying economic activity and prices. In the latest (the Outlook Report), which was released at the end of October, the Bank made public its projection for the next two years or so. The Bank projected that the economy was likely to experience a sustained period of expansion with domestic and external demand increasing and the positive influence of the strength in the corporate sector feeding through into the household sector. Although economic indicators have shown mixed developments since the Bank released its projection, the Bank considers that they do not suggest a change in the mechanisms underlying the economy. The Bank will continue to confirm this by carefully assessing various relevant economic indicators as well as microeconomic information. Let me touch upon a few important factors in this regard. The first factor is developments in overseas economies, especially the U.S. economy. The pace of U.S. economic growth has been decelerating recently due mainly to the decrease in housing investment. The advance estimates of real GDP for the July-September quarter increased at an annual rate of 1.6 percent on a quarter-on-quarter basis. Business fixed investment has continued to increase against the background of high corporate profits, and the deceleration in the growth of private consumption has been moderate supported by the increase in household income and the drop in gasoline prices. Therefore, the U.S. economy is likely to realize a soft landing and to move toward sustainable growth. However, it is important to continue to pay attention to the extent of adjustment in housing prices and whether this affects private consumption, as these factors could impact on production and exports in Japanese industries, for example, in the IT-related industry. Upside risks should also be watched closely, such as the risk of inflation expectations rising in the U.S. economy, given that the rate of resource utilization is high. Taking a look at the global economy as a whole, the Chinese economy continues to expand strongly, and in the euro area, the momentum of economic recovery is becoming more evident. Oil-producing countries, such as those in the Middle East, continue to experience an economic boom. The global economy is likely to keep expanding even in the face of a modest slowdown in the U.S. economy, as expansion in other economies may be expected to offset it. The second factor is whether strong corporate performance will continue. Corporate profits continue to be high as indicated in the semiannual book closings for the first half of fiscal 2006, and business fixed investment continues to increase. Although machinery orders, a leading indicator of business fixed investment, declined substantially in the July-September quarter, this does not indicate a change in the underlying trend of business fixed investment, because the decline was partly a reaction to the sharp increase in the previous quarter and is largely attributable to the fall in orders for cellular phones. The uptrend in corporate profits and business fixed investment is evident in the September (Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan) as well as in the results of various surveys conducted on small firms. However, the Bank does not consider the current state of business fixed investment indicative of overheating. The recent growth in business fixed investment has been supported by the fact that firms are factoring the ongoing rapid growth of the global market into their business strategies, and at the same time are still displaying a strong tendency to evaluate investment profitability strictly. Given that financial conditions continue to be extremely accommodative, however, attention should be paid to the risk of a further acceleration of firms' investment leading to an excessive build-up of capital stock. Whatever the case, the Bank will further examine developments in the corporate sector based on data such as the upcoming December . The third important factor is the extent to which the positive influence of the strength in the corporate sector continues to feed through into the household sector. The number of employees has been rising at an annual rate of 1.0-2.0 percent driven by the strength in corporate activity. Looking at developments in wages per worker, while regular payments have been flat year on year, special payments and overtime payments continue to rise, and as a result wages per worker have been rising moderately. In this situation, private consumption, especially outlays for services and durable consumer goods, continues to trend upward. The preliminary estimates of real GDP for the July-September quarter indicated a decrease in private consumption by 0.7 percent on a quarter-on-quarter basis, but this seems to have been attributable to the substantial decline in consumer spending reported in the , which provides the basic statistics for consumer spending. It should be noted that figures in the were considerably weaker than sales statistics and other statistics related to consumption. Still, even allowing for this, private consumption was somewhat weak in the July-September quarter, and therefore the Bank will watch closely developments in private consumption from the autumn onward so as to check whether this weakness was due to temporary factors, such as unfavorable weather and the tax rise in tobacco products. Lastly, in relation to this point, developments in wages and prices are important factors that need to be watched closely. The Bank expects the year-on-year rate of increase in the consumer price index (CPI; excluding fresh food, on a nationwide basis) to rise gradually with the output gap remaining positive and expanding at a moderate pace while downward pressure from declining unit labor costs (labor costs per unit of output) weakens. If, in contrast with past experience, productivity keeps rising with wage increases lagging behind in spite of the prolonged economic expansion, there may be no upward shift in the inflation rate. Despite the steady tightening of labor market conditions, the rate of increase in wages has remained moderate so far because, while employers faced with intensified global competition are maintaining their restraint on labor costs, employees, having experienced a severe employment situation, continue to prefer stable employment to a wage increase. Although the population of those 15 years old and over has been leveling off, the number of employees has been increasing steadily. If the number of employees keeps increasing in line with the continuing economic expansion, a further tightening of labor market conditions will become inevitable. In this situation, it is natural to assume that upward pressure on wages including regular payments will increase gradually. However, since the point at which this will happen is not clear, developments in wages and the underlying trend in prices continue to require close monitoring. I would like to touch on the Bank's thinking regarding the conduct of monetary policy based on the assessment of economic activity and prices I have just referred to. With regard to the future course of monetary policy, as long as economic activity and prices are expected to develop in line with the Bank's projection in the Outlook Report, the Bank will adjust the level of interest rates gradually in the light of developments in economic activity and prices, while maintaining the accommodative financial conditions ensuing from very low interest rates for some time. As I have stated repeatedly, the adjustment process will proceed gradually. This will avoid impeding the expansion of Japan's economy, and will instead facilitate the realization of sustainable economic expansion. The specific timing of the move will be decided based on careful assessment of developments in economic activity and prices and thorough discussion of the issue among members at each Monetary Policy Meeting. In making such decisions, the Bank will carefully examine individual economic indicators as well as other relevant information in light of the mechanisms underlying economic activity and prices indicated in the October Outlook Report and assess whether economic activity and prices will develop in line with the Bank's projection. Next, let me turn to Japan's financial system. Japanese financial institutions have finally overcome the nonperforming-loan (NPL) problem they had been wrestling with since the bursting of the asset price bubble in the 1990s. In addition, the capital base of Japanese financial institutions has strengthened and Japan's financial system has regained its stability. In such circumstances, financial institutions are ever more focused on developing and offering a wider range of financial services closely tailored to customer needs. For example, banks have increased the variety of financial products offered over the counter, such as investment trusts and private pension policies in addition to conventional bank deposits, and sales of such products have expanded. They have also been more innovative in designing new types of residential mortgage loan products, and as a result, residential mortgage loans have come to account for about a quarter of all bank loans, up from around 10 percent in the 1990s. Finally, the variety of commercial loan products has increased. Banks have increased their syndicated loans and have started to offer small-sized non-collateralized business loans to small and medium-sized firms using the so-called ""credit scoring model,"" a statistical credit examination method. Along with efforts to overcome the NPL problem, financial institutions have been preparing themselves to develop innovative lines of business. Smooth implementation of such new business lines requires financial institutions to accurately identify and assess the risks inherent to each new business and then to manage those risks accordingly. Specifically, financial institutions will need to employ the advanced risk management techniques that have been rapidly developed in recent years so as to appropriately manage the various risks involved in each new business area, for example, credit risks, market risks, and operational risks, and thereby achieve sound business management and enhance profitability. Competition among financial institutions to provide various financial services and develop advanced risk management techniques will not only strengthen financial institutions' ability to provide value-added services but also enhance the functioning of financial markets, thus leading to increased financial system stability. Enhancing the functioning of financial markets is also very important for firms. This will not only increase the efficiency with which firms can raise and invest funds, but will also promote business restructuring, which has been increasing among Japanese firms, as well as facilitate balance-sheet adjustments. The U.S. economy has been growing for some time now -- a fact due in no small part to the increased productivity accompanying innovations in information and communication technology and the improved flexibility in the business management of firms made possible by the deepening and expansion of financial markets. Similarly in Japan, strengthening the business management of financial institutions and further enhancement of the functioning of financial markets are essential in invigorating the economy. The Bank will continue to make full use of occasions such as its on-site examinations, off-site monitoring, and various seminars hosted by the Center for Advanced Financial Technology to support the initiatives of financial institutions to strengthen their business management. Through such activities, we intend to promote financial institutions' initiatives to develop and offer new financial services, thus making a greater contribution to regional economies. As I have explained, Japan's economy is expanding moderately. Looking at the economic situation in the Kansai region, corporate activity has increased due partly to strong exports, and a resulting improvement in corporate profits is being observed, not only at large firms but also at small firms. In order for Japan's economy to continue sustainable growth in the face of various challenges including the declining population, it is crucial for all regions and industries to persist with their efforts to innovate. Since, along with the Tokai and Kanto regions, the Kansai region is pulling Japan's economy forward, I fully anticipate that your originality and inventiveness will continue to play a leading role. As for the Bank, it will continue to support the economy from the monetary side to achieve sustainable economic growth with price stability.","['gdp', 'economy', 'economic', 'microeconomic', 'inflation']","['japan economy', 'japan financial', 'japan strengthening', 'financial japan', 'economy monetary']","['japan economy expanding', 'financial japan economy', 'expansion japan economy', 'explained japan economy', 'japan economy continue']"
3520,r101123a_BOJ,japan,2010-11-23,Advanced and Emerging Economies,shirakawa,1,"Good evening. Today, I am indeed honored to have this precious opportunity to give a speech here in the beautiful and dynamic city of Hong Kong. I would like to begin by expressing my heartfelt thanks to the Bauhinia Foundation Research Centre and the Chairman, Mr. Anthony T. Y. Wu for kindly providing such an honorable occasion to speak in front of our distinguished audience. As you are well aware, financial business is the biggest industry in Hong Kong. Did you know, however, that the financial relationship between Hong Kong and Japan was forged shortly after Hong Kong appeared in modern history? In 1871, three years after the foundation of the Meiji Government, Japan began to issue its first modern currency. The government of the time acquired its minting machinery from the former English Minting Authority in Hong Kong, and invited the engineers to Japan, asking them to issue silver coins of the same weight and quality as those used in Hong Kong. While there are a variety of stories claiming to account for the origin of the name of the Japanese currency, the yen, one of these stories tells us that in fact the yen derives its name from the silver Hong Kong one yuan coin (Slide 1). Financial institutions have also been active since the very early days in helping build close associations between Hong Kong and Japan. The established in Hong Kong in 1865. In the following year, 1866, HSBC opened its branch in Yokohama, and this contributed greatly to the development of trade finance in Japan. Among Japanese banks, the former Yokohama Specie Bank Limited, which is said to have been modeled after HSBC, opened its local office in Hong Kong in 1896. The strong economic ties between Hong Kong and Japan are not limited to financial services but extend also to trade in goods and services. Hong Kong is currently Japan's fifth largest export partner (Slide 2). It must also be pointed out that this trade in products is not confined merely to industrial goods. Believe it or not, despite its total population of less than ten million, Hong Kong is the primary export destination for Japanese agricultural products, some of which may be re-exported to other regions, including mainland China. Japanese luxury fruits are very popular among Hong Kong's gourmet residents. There is also a long-term relationship between Hong Kong and the Bank of Japan. The Bank of Japan opened a representative office in Hong Kong in 1957, aiming to ensure close appreciation of economic developments in the Asian region (Slide 3). Since then, our representatives at the Hong Kong office have been providing extremely valuable and enlightening reports to the Tokyo Head Office on monetary and economic developments in Hong Kong and East Asia, including those on the Asian currency crisis in 1997. We have been enjoying a very close and friendly relationship with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, and I myself have solicited advice for today's speech from my very close friend, Let me now move on to the main subject. The title of my speech today is ""Advanced and express my views on the outlook for the global economy. I will also briefly touch upon several challenges for Asia and Japan from the perspective of ensuring economic developments between the two. I will start with the current state of the global economy. The global economy has been recovering at a modest pace, following its rapid decline after the Lehman shock. The current state can most accurately be described by what has already become a rather Outlook released in October, the growth rate of the global economy was minus 0.6 percent in 2009, followed by a forecast plus 4.8 percent for 2010, and plus 4.2 percent in 2011 (Slide 4). Approximately 70 percent of the growth is contributed by emerging and resource-rich economies. Among those, the growth of Asian emerging economies stands out, and it can be said that Asian emerging economies are currently the growth center for the global economy, and have been a great driving force for its recovery since the global financial crisis. Meanwhile, Japan's economy has also benefited significantly from the growth of the Asian emerging economies. Japan's exports dropped sharply from the end of 2008 to the beginning of 2009, owing to the financial crisis. However, after the spring of 2009, exports showed a significant increase, mainly to China, the ASEAN, and other major Asian economies (Slide 5). The Japanese economy has recovered at the fastest pace among the advanced economies, and one of the main reasons for this has been the significant increase in exports to Asia. Now, what projections can we make about future global economic developments? While the future of the global economy is fraught with uncertainty, I focus particularly on the following three points in making a projection. The first point relates to the advanced economies, especially to an assessment of their balance sheet adjustments. The credit bubbles in the mid-2000s were on a very large scale, particularly in the U.S. and the U.K. economies, and for that reason, it may well take some time for them to recover. Assessment of the effectiveness of macroeconomic policies in advanced economies is also an important element. There is already very limited room for deployment of monetary and fiscal policy in these economies. Given these circumstances, when can we expect the advanced economies to return to a full-fledged recovery path, and how robust will this return be? The second point I wish to raise relates to the growth prospects for the emerging economies. The growth potential of emerging economies may seem very large, but without the appropriate policy taken, the risk of a bubble cannot be ruled out. In addition, although this is not a pressing concern, the smooth transition from a high-growth economy to a mature economy will become one of the important policy challenges for the emerging economies in the longer term. The third point, which interlinks with the above two points, is the issue of capital flows and exchange rates, or more simply, the currency conflict under the ""two-speed recovery."" Japan's experience over the past few decades offers a range of ideas when considering these three points. One of the most debated topics of economic policy over the past several months has been the large-scale asset purchase program implemented by the Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, many commentaries by economists and policy makers suggest that the program was intended to avoid ""Japanese-style deflation"" or ""the lost decade in Japan."" Incidentally, if you search the keyword ""Japanese-style deflation"" on Google, the results have increased rapidly from about four hundred thousand entries during the first half of this year, to about a million during the period from July to mid-November. However, many are interested not only in Japan's experience of deflation or ""the lost decade."" When I talk to my friends in China, it surprises me to learn that in-depth studies are carried out on Japan's experience during the high-growth period and after the Plaza Accord. Now, I would like to express my views on the above three points, by making reference to Japan's experience. Balance sheet adjustments in advanced economies and their aggressive monetary easing Let me start with the issue of balance sheet adjustments or repair in advanced economies, particularly in the United States. Balance sheet adjustments were indeed an issue that Japan struggled to resolve after the burst of the bubble. Real GDP growth in Japan after the burst of the bubble decreased significantly to an annual average of 1.5 percent in the growth picked up somewhat to an average of 1.7 percent until 2007, but dipped again owing to the Lehman shock. Average real GDP growth for the 2000s was merely plus 0.7 percent. As for the inflation rate in Japan, the consumer price index has been on a mild downward impressive in recent years, and this is why discussions in the United States often take place in the context of ""avoiding the Japanisation"" of the U.S. economy. However, such framing of the discussions occasionally makes me feel that Japan's experience and its lessons may be misread. My understanding of the main causes for the decline in Japan's growth rate can be summed up in the following three points. The first cause can be attributed directly to the burst of the bubble. During the formation of the bubble, driven by excess optimism about the future, firms expanded their business capacity and employment, and increased their debt. After the eventual bursting of the bubble, the so-called ""three excesses"" remained, namely excesses in business capacity, employment, and debt. The economy continues to suffer downward pressure as long as ""such excesses"" remain. It was not before the resolution of these ""three excesses"" in 2003 that Japan returned to a full-fledged recovery path (Slide 8). The second cause is the failure of Japanese firms in adapting to the changes in overall trends that took place globally from the late 1980s through the 1990s, namely deregulation, globalization, and the information and technology revolution. During this period, global markets were further integrated, and divisions of labor in production processes were extended on a global scale. Foreign firms increased their value added by optimally re-arranging their production base and sales channels, and reduced costs by effectively expanding outsourcing. On the other hand, it was a significant challenge for Japanese firms to adapt to such circumstantial changes, since their business models were based on centralized control and integrated team production. The industrial model in Japan was supported by a highly skilled domestic labor force under the lifetime employment system. However, since Japanese firms were trapped in the memory of their past successes, they were left behind in adapting themselves to the major trend changes in the global economy. The third cause is the aging and declining population (Slide 9). There are a variety of channels through which demographic changes affect the economy. However, with other conditions being equal, domestic demand will naturally decrease in line with a decrease in population. Likewise from the supply side, a decrease in labor supply will reduce the growth rate. Owing to Japan's rapidly aging population, the growth rate of productive population turned to be negative in 1995, and was minus 0.9 percent in 2009 on a year-on-year basis. The decline in population will also increase the fiscal burden on the working generation. How should we assess the risk of deflation, a question which relates to the debate on ""the lost decade""? In fact, Japan has experienced a mild price decline of about 3 percent on a cumulative basis over a decade. However, the country has not experienced a deflationary spiral, where a decline in prices induces a decline in economic activity, thereby leading to a further decline in prices. This deflationary spiral is the strongest reason for fearing deflation. Instead, in terms of length, Japan experienced its longest post-war period of sustained recovery from 2002 to 2007, though not necessarily spectacular. Hong Kong has also experienced an increase and decline in prices in recent years. For every jurisdiction, it is not appropriate to isolate the issue of deflation from economic structure, in particular from wage setting. If we compare consumer price inflation between Japan and other advanced economies, the rate difference is mainly attributed to the development in the price of services (Slide 10). As the inflation rate declined, wages were set in a more flexible manner in Japan. This flexibility in wage setting was attained not only through a reduction in bonus payments and an increase in the number of non-regular workers, but also through the downward revision of fixed remuneration for regular workers in a flexible manner. Since services are more labor-intensive than the production of goods, the flexible adjustment of nominal wages resulted in a decline in the price of services, which became a cause of the deflation. Since the latter half of the 1990s, corporate management and employees in Japan have given priority to ensuring employment, and a decline in wages has therefore been accepted by the workers. As a flipside to a decline in wages and mild deflation, Japan has experienced an increase in its unemployment rate which is currently at 5.0 percent, but this increase has been much smaller than in the U.S. and European economies. Let me summarize the above argument by highlighting the implications for the current U.S. economy. First, it takes a significant time after the burst of a large bubble for an economy to complete its balance sheet adjustments and return to the path of full-fledged recovery. In this regard, the current U.S. economy may require some more time to repair its balance sheets. Aggressive monetary easing could reduce some of the pain arising from on-going balance sheet adjustments, but it will not extinguish the need for those adjustments. Second, even during the process of balance sheet adjustments, it is essential not to forget paying attention to the importance of the supply side of the economy. Although accommodative monetary policy is important so as to avoid sharp declines in demand, prolonged low interest rates may hinder the growth of productivity by devitalizing economic regeneration. In the longer term, the trend in economic growth rates is determined by supply side factors, namely the growth of the labor force and productivity. On this point, the United States seems to have the advantage over Japan in terms of its more flexible economic structure as well as higher population growth of approximately 1 percent, which is higher than that of Japan in the post-bubble period. However, during the prolonged economic downturn period after the burst of a bubble, policies that may harm long-term efficiency are often introduced in the climate of accumulated social frustrations. Preventing a decline in growth potential appears to be the key to avoiding ""the lost decade"" situation, although this is not an easy task for any economy. How long will the high growth of emerging economies be sustained? The above are my views on the balance sheet adjustments in advanced economies, which is the first point I wish to make in projecting the future developments of the global economy. My second point is on the sustainability of economic growth in emerging economies. Emerging economies have achieved remarkable growth in recent years. If we mathematically extrapolate from the average growth rates of the global economy and BRICs economies for the last ten years, the global share of the BRICs economies will reach more than 80 percent in 2040, although this is considered to be unrealistic. Even these high-growing economies will mature at some stage. Let me now make a simple comparison of Japan's high economic growth in the past and China's economic growth in recent years. Roughly speaking, China's population is ten times greater than that of Japan, China's per capita nominal income is one-tenth of that of Japan, and, accordingly, the nominal GDP for the two countries is about the same. Japan's high economic growth era started in the mid-1950s, and ended in the early 1970s. The average annual growth rate for this fifteen-year period reached about 10 percent (Slide 11). On the other hand, China's high growth era began in the early 1990s, and the average annual growth rate for the first fifteen years was roughly the same as that of Japan during its high growth era. The difference between the two is that China is still continuing its high growth at an average of more than 10 percent. During a period of high growth, the supply of labor from rural agricultural areas is one of the key factors. If we compare the urban population ratios of Japan and China from this perspective, the current ratio for China is about the same as that of Japan during high growth era of the 1960s. The automobile diffusion ratio for China has also reached about the same level as that of Japan in the 1960s, which indicates a consumption boom owing to improvements in income level. Based on such simple comparisons, China's high economic growth is likely to continue for the time being. However, one of the important prerequisites for maintaining high growth is to avoid the formation of a bubble. The authorities in China are well aware of this. I would then like to share my understanding on how the bubble was formed in Japan in the latter half of the 1980s. It was a phenomenon that arose from the complicated interaction of the following factors. The first factor was the overconfidence that became so pervasive throughout Japan. Japan's growth rate gradually declined after its high growth era ended in the early 1970s, and yet growth rates remained far greater than those of other advanced economies up until the 1980s. Inflation rates were quite subdued, and therefore, Japan boasted of itself being an honor student. It may sound like a joke, but there were even calculations in the late 1980s that the land value of the Tokyo metropolitan area alone was sufficient to purchase the whole United States. This economic background fostered overconfidence, and increased the aggressive behavior of many economic entities. The second factor was the lack of a sufficiently prudent financial supervision. Financial institutions considerably increased their lending to the real estate, construction, and non-bank sectors, and loosened their underwriting standards on loans, including collateral evaluation. As a result, the exposures of the financial institutions' portfolios became extremely vulnerable to fluctuations in land prices. The third factor was the prolonged accommodative monetary policy. However, it is not so meaningful to simply state that monetary easing was one of the factors that contributed to the bubble. We need to examine in depth the social and economic background as to why monetary easing was continued for such a prolonged period. One of the reasons is the continuance of the low inflation rate. Another reason is that Japan had been under strong external pressure to squeeze its current account surplus. In order to reduce its current account surplus, Japan needed to expand domestic demand, and strong arguments developed around implementing accommodative monetary policy. Even after the economy had improved, concerns were often expressed, mainly by exporting firms, regarding the appreciation of the yen. These factors stood in strong opposition to withdrawing the accommodative monetary policy. If there are lessons for high-growing emerging economies to learn from Japan's experience, which might help them avoid a bubble, these can be summarized in the following three points. First, society, as a whole, needs to maintain a sense of discipline in order to avoid overconfidence, particularly in times of high growth. Second, I put an emphasis on the importance of the financial regulation and supervision. Especially given that each bubble is different, it is absolutely essential to have a supervisory framework from the perspective of macro-prudence to accurately grasp the overall risk. Third, monetary policy has to aim at domestic stability, which amounts to sustainable economic growth under price stability. We must bear in mind that focusing on foreign exchange rates and current accounts can be detrimental to the stability of the domestic economy. Financial and capital market developments under the ""two-speed recovery"" Let us now move on to my third point in making projections for the global economy. The third point relates to issues arising in financial and capital markets owing to the ""two-speed recovery."" Currently, advanced economies, including Japan, are conducting extremely accommodative monetary policies to ensure their economic recovery. On the other hand, emerging economies are experiencing increasing capital inflows from advanced economies (Slide 12). These capital inflows mainly reflect the high growth prospects of emerging economies, together with the influence of interest rate differentials between advanced and emerging economies. A number of Asian emerging economies have observed their stock prices reaching new historical peaks (Slide 13). Real estate prices have increased at a substantial pace, and the rising trend in global commodity prices is also observed. In terms of the increase in asset prices, Hong Kong is no exception. Given these circumstances, emerging economies have been expressing concerns over the accommodative monetary policy in advanced economies, as it could lead to overheating in their domestic economies and the emergence of a bubble, and further to a possible reversal of capital flows in the future. Advanced economies are, on the other hand, expressing concerns that the foreign exchange rates of emerging economies are less flexible, and this may eventually threaten global sustainable growth by enlarging global imbalances. For reference, the foreign reserve assets of Asian emerging economies dropped slightly immediately after the Lehman shock, but recovered again and increased dramatically (Slide How should we address this currency issue? Textbooks provide clear-cut answers, but have never sufficiently covered the variety of dilemmas that we have actually experienced in recent years, including carry trades, where low interest rate currencies are borrowed as a funding currency and invested in the financial assets of high-yield currencies. Even if the textbooks did provide us with clear-cut answers, these would not instantaneously help resolve the problems we face, as there are no binding powers to ensure their policy implementation across jurisdictions. In this regard, I would like to emphasize that a deep understanding of the textbook principles is important, but at the same time, thinking in a textbook manner alone is not sufficient. Allow me now to confirm a very basic principle from the textbooks. Central banks in every jurisdiction bear the ultimate responsibility for the price stability and economic stability of their jurisdiction. Whether an advanced or an emerging economy, it is natural and legitimate for central banks to take accommodative monetary policy to be strengthened further or otherwise corrected, depending on each economic situation. In relation to exchange rate fluctuations, under the free movements of international capital, fixing the exchange rate would inhibit autonomous monetary policy. Therefore, if the capital inflows to the emerging economies are causing overheating, the textbook answer for them would then be either to accept the appreciation of the currency, or to tighten monetary policy in response to the extent that it affects domestic prices and economic activity. This principle is indeed important. However, the textbooks we have do not consider the important economic reality at this moment, namely the zero interest rate bound and balance sheet adjustments. Given the zero interest rate bound, and given also that there are many economic entities exposed to balance sheet adjustments, it may be more difficult than in other circumstances for monetary easing policy to take effect through domestic economic entities. Rather, it tends to take effect through external channels, such as capital outflows and currency depreciation. The reality for those emerging economies receiving capital inflows is that, although the growth of their financial and capital markets may indeed have been remarkable in recent years, their markets are still small and less liquid compared with those of advanced economies. Hence, when there are large uncovered capital flows into the local currency stock and bond markets of emerging economies, the exchange rate and the price of securities tend to rise simultaneously. This further accelerates the inflows in a self-fulfilling manner, as speculative money seeks the capital gains of currency as well as securities. Such superfluous capital inflows force down domestic bond yields, creating downward pressure on the lending rates of domestic banks, and may lead to a rise in asset prices. Allowing the currency to appreciate may help to deter capital inflows, but if inflationary pressures were suppressed by such currency appreciation, the low interest rate period may be extended owing to the apparent stable price conditions, resulting in the inability to prevent the overheating of the economy and the creation of a bubble. This would suggest that currency appreciation is also not a panacea. In either case, if emerging economies experience the formation and the burst of a bubble, the influence will also rebound to advanced economies. Several years ago, when Japan was implementing its quantitative monetary easing policy, there were criticisms from Asian colleagues that such a policy was promoting carry trades. There have been similar arguments, expressed even more vigorously, since the Federal Reserve recently implemented its large-scale asset purchase program. Although it is understandable for advanced and emerging economies to have their different views, what is essential for us is to acknowledge that we are all in the same boat when it comes to the globalized economy. There is as yet no clear-cut answer to these difficult issues, but I believe it is important that each jurisdiction embraces the following approach when implementing monetary policy. First, advanced and emerging economies need to rethink the meaning of domestic stability of both prices and economic activity, before actually implementing monetary policy. Every central bank aims at ensuring domestic stability for its jurisdiction at any time. However, in order to attain this objective under circumstances of economic and financial globalization, it is becoming important for central banks to take into account the impact that their own monetary easing or lack of flexibility on foreign exchange rates might have overseas, as well as the feedback effects on their jurisdictions. Second, it is also important to implement measures from a prudential policy perspective. last year about the rapid increase in real estate prices, implementing a variety of policy measures, such as the lowering of the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio. These macro-prudential measures are particularly essential for Hong Kong, where a fixed foreign exchange rate regime has been adopted. An issue currently of global importance is how to design macro-prudential measures appropriate to the situation of each domestic economy and to the degree of development in financial markets. IV. Economic development in Japan and other Asian economies So far, I have expressed my views on the outlook for the global economy. Next, in the little time remaining, I would like to change the topic and talk briefly about economic developments in Japan, with particular reference to the economic relationship with other Asian economies. The Japanese economy is facing a number of difficult challenges, as indicated by the declining trend of GDP growth rate. We, Japanese people, often tend to be rather self-reflective, which is also considered a virtue, but I feel that this tendency has been going too far recently. We should avoid being excessively either optimistic or pessimistic. Therefore, I will start by emphasizing the strengths of Japan's economy. First, the growth rate of real GDP per worker in Japan, namely the growth rate of productivity, still bears comparison with that of the United States, although it is no longer what it once was (Slide 15). Second, Japan's financial system is sound. Looking back at the time of the Lehman shock in the fall of 2008, Japan's financial system was relatively more stable than those of competitiveness. For instance, Japan is at the global forefront of advances in environmental technology. Japan has also made advances, during the process of urbanization for example, in areas of high technology associated with infrastructure, including water supply, roads, railways, and harbors. Fourth, Japan has strong economic and historical ties with, and is geographically close to East Asian economies which together currently enjoy the most rapid growth in the world. Recent experience of the global economy suggests that, even in the age of globalization, the importance of geographic closeness still counts. After highlighting these strengths of Japan's economy, I have to admit that it nonetheless faces many challenges. The most pressing challenge is, I think, coping with its demographic changes. Japan's working population has been declining since the latter half of the 1990s, and the number of workers has also shown a declining trend since 1998. Under these circumstances, I believe, the particularly important issues we have to deal with are maintaining a sustainable fiscal balance, and increasing the rate of participation in the elderly and female workforce. Meanwhile, it is also vital that Japan continues to make efforts towards realizing the potential strengths that I mentioned earlier. Strengthening our cooperation with Asian economies is likewise crucial for this issue. Looking at the weight of East Asian economies in exports from Japan, it has increased from 30 percent in 1990 to 40 percent in 2000, and further up to 51 percent in 2009 (Slide 17). The weight of Asia in foreign direct investment from Japan has also been increasing steadily. As such, Japan's relationship with Asian economies has been deepening further. Economic strategy in Asia is one of the important pillars in the Japanese government's ""New Growth Strategy"" which was recently issued. As an example, I would like to mention again environmental technology. Japan was once plagued by low energy efficiency, which resulted in large fluctuations in the real economy as the energy price changed. This also caused serious environmental problems, including air and water pollution. In order to overcome these problems, mainly after the first oil shock, Japan made strenuous efforts to develop energy-efficient and environmentally-friendly technologies by bringing together both public and private sectors. As a consequence, energy unit efficiency in Japan has improved dramatically, and has become the most efficient in the world (Slide 18). This has reduced the impact of resource price changes on domestic prices and the real economy while at the same time bringing environmental benefits, as there are now far fewer environmental disruption problems. The Asian emerging economies have much to improve in terms of environment, and I think there are many areas in which Japan can make a contribution. In terms of cooperation with Asia, finance is an equally important area. In fact, one of the recent key strategies for major Japanese financial institutions has been the strengthening of their business activities in East Asian economies. Developing financial markets in the region is also an important policy issue. According to a BIS survey as of April 2010, global foreign exchange transactions increased by 20 percent compared with that of three years ago. Among them, the share of Asian currencies in foreign exchange transactions is only less than 4 percent (Slide 19). However, given the significant presence of Asian economies in trade in goods and services, this share is expected to increase much further. As such, developing financial markets is important for the Asian region. For instance, there are still limits on the number of Asian currencies that can be settled via the international foreign exchange settlement system called Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS). It is also our task to introduce cross-border collateral arrangements in the region that would enable central banks to supply local currency liquidity against collateral which are financial assets in other jurisdictions. In Asia, there are distinct international financial markets, including Hong Kong, Singapore, and Tokyo. What is expected of the market participants and monetary authorities in those financial markets is to support the overall efficiency and stability of the financial intermediary by being competitive and cooperative with each other. In this regard, I have the deepest respect for one of the HKMA's missions to promote and develop Hong Kong's financial market into an international financial center, and for the innovative policy stance the HKMA has taken. As time is running out, I would like to conclude my speech. The future of the global economy is currently fraught with uncertainty, and we are facing a variety of challenges.

3583,r120421a_BOJ,japan,2012-04-21,The Importance of Fiscal Sustainability: Preconditions for Stability in the Financial System and in Prices,shirakawa,1,"The mission of a central bank is to contribute to sustained growth of the economy by maintaining public confidence in money, and price stability and financial system stability are two facets of this mission. Fiscal sustainability is an important element that has a fundamental impact on both. According to conventional wisdom, when the government loses its credibility with respect to the sustainability of government debt and does not make enough effort to regain it, this ultimately leads to either inflation or a default on the debt. To put this differently, it is often said that a central bank comes to face a tradeoff between price stability and financial system stability. However, since both are essential preconditions for sustained economic growth, it is not at all meaningful to consider which of the two we should choose. What is crucially important is to prevent the economy from getting into such a tradeoff in the first place; for that reason, fiscal sustainability itself is an essential precondition for the proper functioning of a central bank. Let me now elaborate on this point. In normal times, government bonds are traded in large volumes in financial markets and used as collateral, reflecting their characteristics as safe assets. They are also held by financial institutions as liquidity buffers and investment assets. As such, a heightened risk for government debt default is likely to lead to instability in the financial system, through an increase in the liquidity risk and the capital loss of financial institutions. In such a situation, a central bank may be called into action as a ""lender of last resort"" by providing liquidity in order to maintain the stability in financial markets and the financial system, and such operations are expected to be effective at least in the short term. Taking an example restore calm in financial markets. We are fully aware of the importance of such operations, but one has to also keep in mind that they can only be used to ""buy time."" A central bank's operations to ""buy time"" may help the government to garner time to build a public consensus on the need for fiscal consolidation and gain the credibility of market participants for a consolidation plan. However, the side effects of such operations become significant when the government's commitment to fiscal reforms is weak and the plan for fiscal consolidation is less effective. Specifically, a temporary lull in financial markets due to a decline in government bond yields is likely to dilute the sense of urgency among the government and the public, and thus weaken the momentum for progress toward fiscal reforms. If the government continues to run fiscal deficits, a possibility arises in which the central bank is forced to supply an unlimited amount of liquidity -- in the form of either liquidity provision against government bonds as collateral or an outright purchase of government bonds -- in order to get around a re-emergence of financial system instability. Historically, the consequence of such a large-scale supply of money is uncontrollable inflation. If market participants and the public, which have the knowledge of this history, were to anticipate a regime shift at some point, the credibility with respect to government bonds and money would be lost abruptly, and a process leading to uncontrollable inflation would begin. After all, without solid progress toward fiscal consolidation, we cannot avoid significantly adverse impacts on economic activity and the standard of living. Now I would like to take up the case of Japan, which attracts frequent questions. As is well known, the ratio of gross government debt to GDP in Japan is the highest among developed countries. In spite of such unfavorable fiscal conditions, the government bond yields remain low and stable, and policy discussions are focused on mild deflation instead of concerns regarding inflation, as evidenced by the fact that the consumer price index has fallen by 3.4 percent in cumulative terms since 1998, which can be translated to 0.2 percent annually. The low level of the government bond yields is consistent with the growth rate of the economy and the inflation rate, and at issue is the interpretation of the premium that could arise from worsening fiscal situations. It seems difficult to explain the case of Japan in light of the conventional wisdom. One frequently offered explanation is that the ample domestic savings in Japan have absorbed the issuances of Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs) and the share of JGBs held by foreign investors is very small. But a more fundamental explanation is that the stability in the government bond yields reflects market participants' expectations that fiscal soundness will be restored through structural reforms in both the economic and fiscal areas. At the moment, such expectations are not firmly backed by concrete reform plans; the public therefore restrains spending on concerns over future fiscal developments, and this constitutes one factor behind sluggish economic growth and mild deflation. If this is indeed the case, the experience of Japan indicates a possibility that a cumulative increase in government debt, combined with weak growth expectations, might generate deflationary pressures as long as the government retains its credibility with respect to eventual fiscal consolidation. In other words, this is the situation before the loss of fiscal sustainability leads to either inflation or a default on the debt. Behind the decline in growth expectations and the cumulative increase in government debt are the aging of the population and the failure of the Japanese economy to adjust to it in a flexible manner. There is a limitation, at least in the short run, to changing the demographic trend itself. Therefore, given that the rapid aging of the population is likely to continue, strengthening the growth potential through productivity improvements and making the fiscal structure sustainable in the situation of an aging population are the most important challenges for Japan in terms of maintaining macroeconomic stability over the medium to long term.","['stability', 'fiscal', 'stable', 'financial', 'sustainability']","['financial stability', 'stability financial', 'fiscal sustainability', 'macroeconomic stability', 'financial instability']","['stability financial stability', 'financial stability essential', 'maintain stability financial', 'financial stability facets', 'fiscal sustainability important']"
3610,r121015a_BOJ,japan,2012-10-15,"Strengthening Growth Potential, Role of the Market, and ""Production of Information""",yamaguchi,0,"Thank you for having me at the annual conference jointly hosted by the Securities Analysts the participants here have been striving for the development of securities markets, and, through such efforts, have been contributing to the sound development of Japan's economy. On behalf of the Bank of Japan, I will pay great respect to your efforts. of Information',"" I will talk about my views on the importance of the financial function that supports economic growth and how securities markets should be, and then I will send cheers to securities analysts while referring to their expected roles. 50 years ago, in 1962 when the SAAJ was established, Japan's economy was in the midst of a high growth period. Japan's economy grew by an annual average of 9.7 percent from 1956 up to 1970. It made a transition to stable growth, triggered by the oil shocks, but was on a constant growth path until a bubble burst at the beginning of the 1990s. After the burst of a bubble, things changed completely and the average growth rate declined substantially to around 1.5 percent in the 1990s and around 0.5 percent in the 2000s. The history of securities markets developed in tandem with such a long-term trend in the real economy. During the high growth period, firms' buoyant fund demand was mainly supported by indirect finance. However, even during such period, the securities markets gradually came close to people as the phrase ""goodbye banks, hello securities firms"" began to be heard in the early 1960s when investment trust started to spread among people. Subsequently, the markets continued to grow by weathering trials, including securities markets' slump after the Tokyo Olympics and, in the 1980s, both the stocks market and the corporate bonds market got into full swing amid financial liberalization and globalization. While equity finance by convertible bonds and warrant bonds rapidly increased during the bubble period on the back of strong expectations for a rise in stock prices, market expansion based on excessive expectations did not last long after all. Since the 1990s, a variety of reforms have taken place mainly to address various events that surfaced in accordance with the emergence and the burst of a bubble, and the markets have steadily improved. However, amid the continued low economic growth, the environment surrounding securities markets has been severe and there has recently been concern over a decline in the competitiveness of Japanese securities markets compared with those overseas. I have been mentioning repeatedly on various occasions the fundamental background to a declining trend in the growth potential of Japan's economy. Put it simply, the economy has not sufficiently adapted to major changes of the demographic vortex and globalization. Therefore, to strengthen growth potential, it is essential to tap new potential demand associated with progress in aging and to incorporate expanding global demand, mainly that of Asian economies. To that end, firms' attempts and an improvement in the environment that supports such attempts are required. Given that new attempts are always associated with risks, it is not too much to say that the power of finance that evaluates and shoulders such risks will be a key to strengthening the growth potential of Japan's economy. Encouraging firms' attempts and unlocking their growth potential will promote business fixed investment and research and development, expand employment, raise wages, and, through an increase in interest and dividend as well as capital gain, strengthen households' income and asset formation. In the 2000s, Japan's economy experienced an economic expansion of six years and one month, which was longer than the Izanagi boom during the high growth period, and the Nikkei Stock Average once rose to about 18,000 yen. However, corporate behavior to achieve an improvement in business performance through cutting wages and costs was retained strongly during that period. And, to start with, the economic recovery relied heavily on exports on the back of financial bubbles in the United States and Europe. Therefore, while the economic expansion continued for a long time on the surface, it did not become a sustainable economic recovery backed by an autonomous mechanism. Given such recent experience, it is not an easy task to bring out many firms' incentives to take on the challenge of tapping potential demand and thereby strengthening growth potential amid further progressing aging. However, that is why there are high expectations for the role of financial and capital markets, in which growth money is created. Of course, among eventual fund providers in the financial and capital markets, there are those who want to invest their funds safely by making deposits and there are those who want to increase their investment profits by taking certain risks. It is necessary to enhance the capability of financial and capital markets as a whole to convert a variety of fund management needs into economic growth, while utilizing each characteristic of indirect and direct finance. Based on what I have said, now, I will focus on the securities markets in which analysts are directly involved, and from the viewpoint of strengthening power that creates economic growth and developing securities markets themselves, I will mention three conditions for a desirable form of markets. First, a high degree of efficiency and fairness. Securities markets can function efficiently only after proper pricing for risks and returns is made. Therefore, it is deemed desirable that many investors who have a variety of evaluation criteria should participate and that the markets should be highly liquid. To that end, first of all, offers of versatile solutions for each fund raiser and fund investor as well as securities trading in the secondary markets have to be made at low costs, namely, the markets need to be a place of efficient financial transactions. In addition, in order for the markets to be a place in which many investors feel safe in participating, the fairness of transactions based on proper governance and high ethical standards has to be guaranteed. In Japanese securities markets, especially after the burst of a bubble, various kinds of system reform have been made in order mainly to achieve a sound competitive environment. However, securities markets have recently been exposed to harsh global competition. In order to maintain the international competitiveness of Japanese securities markets, it is critical to unflaggingly implement efforts to enhance the markets' efficiency and fairness in the future. In that regard, a move to establish Asia's number one stock exchange by merging the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the Osaka Securities Exchange is highly expected as a new start of Japanese securities markets. Second, the existence of investors who aim at increasing their medium- to long-term returns. Of course, I do not deny that aiming at short-term trading profits is one of investment strategies or that it enhances market dynamism and liquidity. However, not only to chase short-term profits but, for example, for investment institutions, including pension funds and insurance companies, to make utmost efforts to raise medium- to long-term returns will enhance securities markets' function of selecting promising firms and projects and eventually contribute to achieving sustainable growth of Japan's economy. In that regard, it is also important that households, which are the eventual fund providers, become highly interested in their own asset management. Given that most of households' financial assets of 1,500 trillion yen have still been in cash or deposits even though long time has passed since ""savings to investment"" was called for, there seems to be plenty of room for improving the environment which gets growth money out of sleep. For example, to promote initiatives to raise interest in asset management, including the enhancement of financial education that fits each age-group, could encourage investment institutions, which receive households' long-term funds, to compete at a higher level. Third, the markets need to be a place in which high quality information is created to steadily support investment judgment. What is important, first of all, is disclosure of fund raisers and investors relations. While it goes without saying that honest and fair disclosure is required, in addition to that, it is critical that firms strive to actively and convincingly explain their own management strategies. Firms' information will be analyzed and evaluated from various angles by market participants, and utilized for investors' decision making. In financial theory, a situation in which fund providers do not have sufficient information of fund-raisers is called ""information asymmetry"" and, if the asymmetry is substantial, even growth of firms with great potential will be constrained from the funding side. Therefore, it is considered that the resolution of ""information asymmetry"" is the intrinsic function of finance and added-value that finance contributes to economic activity. Added-value is created through ""production of information."" While the ""production of information"" is somewhat an abstract expression, simply put its specific meaning, it is nothing less than high-quality analysis and evaluation of the investment asset class. And, those who play an important role in that regard are securities analysts. Now let me offer three specific expectations for securities analysts. First, neutral information transmission based on accurate analysis. The standpoint of securities analysts varies according to organizations they belong to, such as the sell-side, the buy-side, and the rating agency. However, for the information they transmit to be trusted and influential, the accuracy of analysis as well as a fair and neutral perspective will be inevitable elements. As for a specific angle of analysis and message to be emphasized, individual securities analysts should devise ways by fully utilizing their respective expertise and knowledge. With securities analysts stimulating each other from different perspectives, ""production of information"" in the markets as a whole will be elevated both in terms of quality and quantity. What I especially expect is the ""production of information"" that contributes to exploring growing companies. Although the growth potential of Japan's economy has been declining, if looked at individually, there are many firms with high profits and growth, and there will be further more potentially growing firms. Finding out such promising investment opportunities one by one and nurturing them, while it seems a roundabout approach, will offer a potent breakthrough for eventually increasing growth potential of Japan's economy. Second, maintaining full communication with firms. While the role of securities analysts is basically to provide investors with analysis on firms, cherishing connection with firms that are the subject of analysis eventually means that securities analysts will ask those firms their unique questions. Namely, securities analysts can contribute to the process, in which firms constantly develop their business strategies while incorporating investors' perspectives. In other words, securities analysts play a valuable role as an interactive connecting point between firms and investors. Third, playing an active role as global human resources. While currently a slowdown in emerging economies has become somewhat protracted, those economies have high growth potential in the medium to long term and, on the financial front, it is likely that especially Asian securities markets will expand substantially. Just like today's conference, information exchange and interaction of people at a global level will become increasingly active in the future. In order to improve the attractiveness of Japan's securities markets and attract overseas investors, and also to utilize expanding overseas investment opportunities in the asset formation of Japanese households, I expect securities analysts to play an active role with the key words ""Asia"" or ""global."" From the perspective of strengthening growth potential of Japan's economy, today I have talked about the importance of the role securities markets and securities analysts play. I think the aforementioned term ""production of information"" illustrates how financial business is a knowledge-intensive industry. In Japan's economy, in which the labor force has been declining in association with aging, increasing the growth rate of added-value per capita is a necessary condition for economic growth. If the typical knowledge-intensive industry of financial business enhances the ability of creating added-value and grows, it will itself contribute to strengthening the growth potential of Japan's economy. I have high hopes that securities analysts, while holding their strong intellectual curiosity and sensibility to read the times, will make a valuable contribution to the development of Japan's securities markets and eventually to the development of Japan and Asia.","['securities', 'investment', 'invest', 'markets', 'investor']","['japan securities', 'japan economy', 'growth japan', 'japanese securities', 'markets growth']","['japan economy grew', 'growth japan economy', 'japan securities markets', 'growth period japan', 'japan economy experienced']"
3655,r131113a_BOJ,japan,2013-11-13,Economic Activity and Prices in Japan and Monetary Policy,miyao,0,"Thank you for giving me this opportunity to exchange views with people representing Nagano Prefecture, who have taken time to be here despite their busy schedules. Please allow me to express my gratitude for your cooperation with the activities of the Bank of Japan's Matsumoto Branch and the local office in the city of Nagano. Today, I will review economic activity and prices in Japan, whose economy has been recovering moderately, and then discuss the Bank's monetary policy. My concluding remarks will touch briefly on the economy of Nagano Prefecture. Following my speech, I would like to listen to your views on the actual situation of the local economy and to your candid opinions. Economic activity in Japan stopped weakening after the turn of 2013. Domestic demand remained resilient, partly due to the effects of monetary easing and various economic measures. Overseas economies were gradually heading toward a pick-up. Against this background, the economy then returned to a moderate recovery path around the middle of I will elaborate on the recent developments in Japan's economy. As for external demand, although some emerging economies other than China and commodity-exporting economies have shown signs of weakness, overseas economies as a whole are gradually heading toward a pick-up. Specifically, (1) the U.S. economy continues to recover moderately against the backdrop of firm private demand, (2) the European economy has stopped weakening, and (3) the Chinese economy has been stabilizing. On the back of these factors and partly supported by developments in foreign exchange rates, exports have generally been picking up, albeit at a moderate pace. As for domestic demand, business fixed investment as a whole has been picking up, as corporate profits and business sentiment are improving; in addition to the resilience in business fixed investment in the nonmanufacturing sector, positive developments have started to be seen in that in the manufacturing sector. While public investment has continued to increase, as positive effects of various economic measures have come to take hold fully, housing investment has also been increasing. Private consumption has remained resilient, reflecting an improving trend in consumer sentiment from a somewhat long-term perspective as well as recent improvement in the employment and income situation. Reflecting such developments in domestic and external demand, industrial production has been increasing moderately. An improvement in activity in the nonmanufacturing sector, including services and construction, has been more evident than that in production in the manufacturing sector. As for the outlook, Japan's economy is expected to continue its moderate recovery (Chart 3). To elaborate, overseas economies -- mainly the advanced economies -- are expected to gradually pick up. Emerging economies other than China and commodity-exporting economies, some of which are exhibiting weakness, will likely continue to lack growth momentum for the time being. However, from a somewhat long-term perspective, their growth rates are likely to start picking up again with an improvement in the advanced economies. Under these circumstances, exports and industrial production are expected to increase moderately, and domestic demand is expected to remain firm. The pick-up in business fixed investment will become pronounced as moves to undertake postponed investment for maintenance and replacement spread in tandem with continued improvement in corporate profits. Private consumption is expected to maintain its resilience, underpinned by an improvement in the employment and income situation. In this way, a virtuous cycle will operate more clearly both in the corporate and household sectors. Meanwhile, as for prices, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI) for all items less fresh food turned positive in mid-2013 and has recently been in the range of 0.5-1.0 percent, as prices of energy-related items such as petroleum products and electricity have been rising and cost increases have been passed on to selling prices with resilient private consumption. As for the outlook, although the upward pressure from energy-related items will weaken gradually, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is expected to continue to follow a rising trend as medium- to long-term inflation expectations will rise with a moderate improvement in the aggregate supply and demand balance. What I have presented is generally consistent with the path toward achieving the 2 percent price stability target, which I described in a speech in April 2013 at a meeting with business leaders in Gifu. In that speech, I presented a path consisting of the following five stages: (1) recovery in the world economy; (2) accommodative financial conditions, reflected in asset prices and foreign exchange rates; (3) a gradual rise in the potential growth rate of Japan's economy accompanied by an increase in business fixed investment and structural reforms; (4) an improvement in the output gap amid firm household spending; and (5) a gradual heightening in inflation expectations. I then emphasized that, with this path, it was important that the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI rise above 1 percent during fiscal 2014. I continued that, if the virtuous cycle of the five-stage path was maintained thereafter and the medium- to long-term trend inflation rate increased toward 2 percent, the actual inflation rate was expected to approach the 2 percent price stability target. After about half a year, although the recovery in the world economy -- the first stage of the path -- has lagged somewhat behind and household spending -- the fourth stage -- has turned out to be somewhat stronger than expected, it can be judged that the path is generally on track to achieve the 2 percent price stability target. In particular, the recovery in private consumption, as well as in the nonmanufacturing sector, affects a wide range of economic activity, and therefore may support upward pressure on a broad range of prices. As I have described, Japan's economy is likely to continue its moderate recovery. However, both upside and downside uncertainties exist over the economic outlook, such as the following, and I am paying slightly more attention to the downside risks overall. First, there is uncertainty regarding developments in overseas economies. In particular, some emerging economies other than China and commodity-exporting economies are facing structural problems such as current account deficits, and thus pose downside risks. I also recognize that attention should be paid to the possibility that the recovery in the U.S. economy and the world economy may be delayed depending on the consequences of the fiscal problem in the United States. Second is developments in households' employment and income situation. For domestic demand to continue to maintain its firmness in the future, the key issue is whether a virtuous cycle whereby improvement in the employment and income situation supports consumption will be maintained. In this regard, despite some downside risks, I see a possibility that the mechanism of upward momentum may operate, about which I will explain in the next section. Third is the effects of the consumption tax hikes. The hikes will have adverse effects on households' real disposable income, but the effects are likely to be mitigated to some extent by, for example, the government's various economic measures. On this basis, whether these effects will slow the economy by more than expected depends on the employment and income situation and developments in prices at each point in time. Therefore, attention should be paid to the effects of the consumption tax hikes. Fourth, firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations are subject to uncertainty. These expectations may be either raised or lowered depending on firms' innovations, such as their creative efforts to boost demand, on progress in regulatory and institutional reforms, and on future developments in tax reforms. 1. Sustainability of the resilience in private consumption The current economic recovery is characterized by domestic demand-led growth, led by private consumption in particular, as opposed to recovery in the past that typically was led by external demand such as exports and production (Chart 4). In what follows, I will take up the topic of sustainability of the resilience in private consumption and explain its background as well as the issues I consider to be important with regard to anticipating developments in economic recovery. a. Improvement in consumer sentiment: rise in stock prices and improvement in the employment and income situation Favorable consumer sentiment is one factor that underpins private consumption. The Consumer Confidence Index, which is a major indicator for consumer sentiment, has been improving significantly since end-2012. It is often noted that this is attributable to the rise in stock prices during the same period (Chart 5). Looking at developments in stock prices, their uptrend continues on the back of the improvement in corporate profits and more accommodative financial conditions. Some take the view that, through the improvement in household sentiment, the rise in stock prices only boosts consumption by the wealthy and the elderly who hold stocks. Even so, it is reasonable to say that higher stock prices have been stimulating spending by those people who are willing to spend. It should be noted that wealth effects for the elderly seem to spill over into the working segment of the population, as seen in, for example, greater consumption related to grandchildren and increased demand for three-generation family trips. One factor that could affect consumer sentiment more broadly is the employment and income situation. For example, if firms offer more jobs and the number of employees rises, the overall outlook for income improves, thereby making consumer sentiment more favorable. An improvement in the employment and income situation could make people more willing to borrow and spend more confidently. In fact, a strong correlation is observed between the active job openings-to-applicants ratio -- which represents the number of job openings relative to the number of job seekers -- and the Consumer Confidence Index (Chart 6). Employment conditions as suggested by the active job openings-to-applicants ratio and the unemployment rate deteriorated in the wake of the Lehman shock, but thereafter have been on a recovery trend. If this trend continues, consumer sentiment is likely to be underpinned at a high level. b. Sustainable improvement in income: rise in labor productivity A rise in labor productivity is important in terms of providing support for improvement in economic activity and income in the longer run, as this means strengthening the foundations for Japan's economic growth. If prospects for a sustainable improvement in income are widely acknowledged, private consumption will continue to be resilient. Labor productivity per worker has been growing steadily, albeit at a moderate pace, and this trend has been firmly taking hold despite such significant events as the Lehman shock and the Looking at a breakdown by industry, labor productivity in the nonmanufacturing sector has been exhibiting higher growth in the past couple of years (Chart 8). The level of labor productivity in the nonmanufacturing sector is still lower than that in the manufacturing sector. In addition, it remains difficult to increase value-added in some segments of the nonmanufacturing sector, due in part to various regulations. However, labor productivity in the nonmanufacturing sector as a whole continues to show higher growth than in the past, and has been exceeding the level seen before the Lehman shock. Developments in labor productivity include the effects of cyclical economic recovery, but the underlying trend reflects a pick-up in economic growth potential from a somewhat long-term perspective. For example, reports on interviews with firms and other relevant information across regions suggest steady progress in firms' efforts to create demand, such as for high value-added services, and to make active fixed investment, with both being done across a wide range of areas such as wholesaling and retailing, construction and real estate, accommodations, and eating and drinking services. Recent developments in the underlying trend of labor productivity in the nonmanufacturing sector show a strong correlation with developments in private consumption (Chart 9). There is a possibility -- although this interpretation should be taken with care -- that the rise in productivity has been boosting prospects for a sustainable improvement in income, leading to higher growth in private consumption. The rise in labor productivity in the nonmanufacturing sector may also be exerting upward pressure on a broad range of prices through the growth in consumption (Chart 10). It can be considered that this rise has exerted a positive influence on the inflation rate through an improvement in the supply-demand balance, as its effects of increasing value-added and demand would more than offset its effects of generating price competition through cost cuts and subsequently exerting downward pressure on prices. In the manufacturing sector, the rise in labor productivity in terms of value-added in Japan has come to a pause. However, looking at the corporate sector, firms have been steadily enhancing their ability to make profits on a global basis. Overseas, for example, they are increasing their production, fixed investment, and parts procurement. In the manufacturing sector, corporate profits have recently been growing rapidly, helped in part by developments in foreign exchange rates, and stock prices are firm, as are those in the nonmanufacturing sector (Charts 11 and 12). It should also be noted that Japan's net income from the rest of the world exceeds the historical peak (Chart 13). If the current account surplus is maintained through an improvement in the income balance, the country's net assets will increase, thereby exerting positive effects on consumption. 2. People's inflation expectations: forward-looking expectation formation People's inflation expectations have been rising on the whole. For example, in terms of short-term inflation expectations such as those for fiscal 2013 or for a year ahead, many indicators -- including the results of surveys conducted on households, economists, and market participants -- show a gradual rise. Medium- to long-term inflation expectations, such as for five and ten years ahead, are also rising, according to surveys conducted on Let me elaborate on how people form expectations of future inflation rates. Generally speaking, there are two ways to predict economic variables. One is backward-looking expectation formation, where past results are directly used to form expectations. A typical example is that the inflation rate for the previous period is simply assumed as the expected future inflation rate. In this case, expectations for future inflation rates are fixed to actual past inflation rates. The other is forward-looking expectation formation, where future inflation rates are predicted in line with the underlying mechanism of future developments in economic activity. As an example, let us simply consider the Phillips curve and assume that prices rise when economic activity improves. Given this, when prospects for a sustainable improvement in economic activity are widely acknowledged in view of efforts to strengthen the foundations for economic growth and the spread of policy effects, people expect a rise in prices based on the relationship between economic activity and prices at a future point in time -- in other words, inflation expectations will rise. Meanwhile, in the corporate sector, better prospects for economic activity and sales will enable firms to ease price competition and pass higher costs on to selling prices. As a result, prices for the present period will likely incur upward pressure, thereby shifting the entire observed Phillips curve upward, or making the curve steeper than before. In the actual formation of inflation expectations, aspects of both the backward-looking and forward-looking formations are considered to coexist. This is called hybrid-type expectation formation. Based on past experiences, the aspect of backward-looking expectation formation is prominent in Japan. On the other hand, the government and the central bank have been strongly pursuing initiatives to work on forward-looking expectations. The government has been working to raise expectations for economic growth by increasing public spending and promoting regulatory and institutional reforms. The Bank has set the 2 percent price stability target and has been conducting large-scale monetary easing with the aim of achieving this target at the earliest possible time, and thereby continues to provide strong support from the financial side to ensure sustainable economic recovery. In the corporate sector, if there is a continuation of nonmanufacturing firms' innovations and fixed investment that I mentioned earlier, their labor productivity will rise further, which could lead to continuous improvement in the income outlook. Taken altogether, with the prospect of sustainable improvement in economic activity, it is possible that the proportion of people who are oriented to forward-looking expectation formation will increase. Of course, whether Japan's economy will move in line with the scenario I mentioned earlier is uncertain, as the environment surrounding firms and households remains severe. At the same time, however, macro data and information from interviews with firms -- both of which indicate sustainable improvement in consumption and income -- as well as the recent gradual rise in medium- to long-term inflation expectations suggest that Japan's economy as a whole seems to be gradually moving in line with this scenario. Taking account of this mechanism, I see some possibility that medium- to long-term inflation expectations will rise. Let me now explain the policy framework of quantitative and qualitative monetary easing First, the Bank conducts money market operations so that the monetary base will increase at an annual pace of about 60-70 trillion yen. Second, it purchases Japanese government bonds (JGBs) so that their amount outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 50 trillion yen, and the average remaining maturity of the Bank's JGB purchases will be about seven years. Third, it purchases exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) so that their amounts outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 1 trillion yen and about 30 billion yen, respectively. And fourth, for CP and corporate bonds, the Bank continues with these asset purchases until their amounts outstanding reach 2.2 trillion yen and 3.2 trillion yen, respectively, by end-2013; thereafter, it will maintain these amounts outstanding. The Bank will continue with QQE, which consists of the measures I have just cited, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will examine both upside and downside risks to economic activity and prices, and make adjustments as appropriate. As a result, calculated on a stock basis, the monetary base and the amounts outstanding of JGBs as well as ETFs will double in two years. The ratio of the monetary base to nominal GDP is expected to increase to about 56 percent by end-2014. This not only stands above the other advanced economies, but also is more than three times larger than the ratio before the Lehman shock. The amounts outstanding of the monetary base and JGBs at end-October 2013 stood at about 189 trillion yen and about 132 trillion yen, respectively, and accumulation of the amount outstanding of the monetary base and purchases of assets have been progressing smoothly. More than six months have passed since the introduction of QQE, and its effects, together with those of the government's various economic measures, have emerged in the form of improvement in economic activity as well as in financial market developments. In financial markets, long-term interest rates have been stable at a low level of around 0.6 percent. Stock prices have risen by more than 30 percent compared with at the beginning of 2013, and this growth exceeds that in European and U.S. stock prices. Financial institutions' portfolio rebalancing has not made marked progress yet, but households are increasingly investing in financial assets such as investment trusts. In terms of economic activity, real GDP in Japan registered a relatively high growth rate for two consecutive quarters through the April-June quarter of 2013. The unemployment rate has declined to around 4 percent -- a level seen before the Lehman shock. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI for all items less food and energy has improved to around 0.0 percent, and inflation expectations appear to be rising on the whole, considering market indicators and the results of various surveys. Given that the effects of monetary policy on economic activity and prices appear with a time lag, these improvements in economic activity and prices can be partly attributable to the effects produced by successive monetary easing measures implemented before the introduction of QQE. In any case, it seems that the implementation of a large-scale monetary easing and a commitment to continuing with it as long as it is necessary for maintaining the 2 percent price stability target in a stable manner are underpinning the improvement in economic activity and prices. A final assessment of the effects of QQE on economic activity and prices can be made only after it is lifted, but I would like to explain at this point my empirical analysis on the effects of the quantitative easing (QE) policy -- adopted by the Bank during 2001-06 -- on the macroeconomy. The result, although tentative, showed that the QE policy had a certain effect on economic activity (production), and that a transmission channel through asset prices -- namely, stock prices and foreign exchange rates -- had been working. The QE policy's effect on prices, however, was not as clear as that on economic activity. One possible way of interpreting this result is that prices had been less responsive to an improvement in economic activity brought about by the policy -- that is, a slope of the Phillips curve had been relatively flat during the period of quantitative easing. Therefore, I think that the key issue is whether QQE will make the Phillips curve steeper than before or shift the entire curve upward in line with the mechanism I explained earlier. As I mentioned, inflation expectations could be more forward looking in the current phase of economic recovery that is led mainly by private consumption. Initiatives taken by the government and the corporate sector to achieve economic growth are likely to strengthen such effects by enhancing confidence in sustainable improvement in economic activity. I will continue to carefully examine efforts made by each economic entity as well as future developments in the Phillips curve to see if there is any progress in terms of a change in the slope or an upward shift. 2. Communication regarding the conduct of monetary policy Central banks in advanced economies are making efforts to increase transparency, aiming at appropriate communication to the public regarding their policy conduct. Specifically, such efforts include the following. First, clarifying the policy target by, for example, using numerical expressions. Second, explaining the outlook for economic activity and associated risks, which form the basis for policy decisions. Third, making public the process of policy formulation through release of the minutes of policy meetings and through press conferences. And fourth, communicating to the public, as necessary, regarding the future conduct of monetary policy and factors relevant to policy decisions, such as guidance with regard to continuation of monetary easing. Through all these efforts, it becomes easier for market participants and the public to predict the future course of monetary policy and utilize such prediction in their decision-making. On the other hand, there are in fact challenges to central banks' communication with financial markets and the public, as uncertainties surround the economy and policy effects, particularly in the current situation where unconventional policies are taken. In the United States, since May 2013, given the prospects for economic recovery, the Federal Reserve had been suggesting the possibility that it might start reducing the pace of its large-scale asset purchases -- known as ""tapering,"" in view of the prospect that the size of asset purchases would gradually be reduced -- by end-2013. It thus enhanced communication regarding economic conditions and economic indicators that were necessary to initiating the tapering. In response, financial markets rapidly factored in the future normalization of policy, thereby causing the surge in U.S. long-term interest rates. The Federal Reserve postponed the start of tapering in September, which was the timing initially considered most likely by the markets, due in part to the slow pace of recovery in employment and the deadlock caused by the fiscal debate. The Federal Reserve might have been aware of the risk that the greater-than-expected rise in interest rates would actually impair the economic recovery. Long-term interest rates edged down thereafter but have been at a level of around 1 percentage point higher than that seen before May. A series of events the Federal Reserve has experienced seems to be instructive for the Bank of Japan for the future. The Bank will continue to aim at making better communication to the public. My concluding remarks will touch on the economy of Nagano Prefecture. The postwar development of the economy of Nagano Prefecture has been supported mainly by manufacturing, such as of electric machinery, general machinery, and transportation equipment. However, because this is a manufacturing-oriented economy, it had been experiencing a relatively large adverse impact from the Lehman shock and the yen's appreciation in recent years. As for nonmanufacturing, firms had been facing a difficult situation on the whole, mainly because public works had been declining due to the fiscal consolidation of municipal governments and because the number of tourists had been decreasing, reflecting a declining population of skiers. However, both the manufacturing and nonmanufacturing sectors have recently headed toward a moderate pick-up on the back of a recovery in exports and an increase in public works. Indeed, Nagano Prefecture has many advantages, such as a high level of technological capability in monozukuri , or manufacturing, and abundant resources related to tourism and agriculture. It also is worth noting that the average life expectancies for both men and women in the prefecture are the longest in Japan, and the employment rate of elderly people also ranks top in the nation. This suggests that the prefecture possesses the latent strength to maintain its economy's vitality even in the midst of such structural changes as the aging population and declining birth rate. With the aim of making greater use of these advantages, Nagano Prefecture has formulated a strategic plan to promote monozukuri industry in the prefecture, encouraging cooperative efforts among those in industry, government, and academia to improve competitiveness, mainly in manufacturing, and to cultivate the industry's next generation of human resources. Moreover, I heard that some financial institutions in the region have together established an investment fund to enhance support for the business revitalization of small firms. I believe that both of these actions are of significant importance with regard to stimulating the regional economy. Turning to transportation infrastructure, Nagano Prefecture is going to have two big events: an extension of the Hokuriku Shinkansen line and the launch of the Linear Chuo Shinkansen line. As a result, Nagano Prefecture will be linked much more closely not only with the Hokuriku region but also with the two major metropolitan areas of Tokyo and Nagoya. This could have an unprecedented impact on the industrial structure and demographic trends of Nagano Prefecture. I expect that the prefecture's economy will make full use of its potential by viewing such changes as strategic opportunities.","['economy', 'japan', 'economic', 'economies', 'yen']","['japan economy', 'japan economic', 'economy nagano', 'gdp japan', 'bank japan']","['japan economy external', 'japan economy recovering', 'economic activity japan', 'japan economy accompanied', 'described japan economy']"
3775,r160512b_BOJ,japan,2016-05-12,The Bank's Semiannual Report on Currency and Monetary Control,kuroda,1,"Statement by Haruhiko Kuroda, Governor of the Bank of Japan, concerning the before the Committee The Bank of Japan submits to the Diet its in June and December. I am pleased to have this opportunity today to talk about developments in Japan's economy and present an overall review of the Bank's conduct of monetary policy. First of all, I would like to express my sincere condolences to the victims of the Kumamoto Earthquake and offer my heartfelt sympathies to those who are suffering. The Bank of Japan's Kumamoto Branch -- together with its neighboring branches and Head Office -- is making efforts to maintain the payment and settlement infrastructure, including the smooth supply of cash. At the Monetary Policy Meeting held at the end of April 2016, the Bank decided to introduce a funds-supplying operation for financial institutions in disaster areas affected by the Kumamoto Earthquake at a total loan amount set at 300 billion yen, with a view to supporting them in their efforts toward meeting demand for funds for restoration and rebuilding. This operation will surely contribute to backing the restoration and rebuilding. Now, I will explain economic and financial developments in Japan. Japan's economy has continued its moderate recovery trend, with a virtuous cycle from income to spending operating in both the household and corporate sectors, although exports and production have been sluggish, due mainly to the effects of the slowdown in emerging economies. With regard to the outlook, although sluggishness is expected to remain in exports and production for the time being, domestic demand is likely to follow an uptrend, and exports are expected to increase moderately on the back of emerging economies moving out of their deceleration phase. Thus, Japan's economy is likely to be on a moderate expanding trend. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI) for all items less fresh food is about 0 percent. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI for all items less fresh food and energy has remained positive for 30 consecutive months and has been above 1 percent recently; this suggests that the underlying trend in inflation has been improving steadily. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI for all items less fresh food is likely to be about 0 percent for the time being, due to the effects of the decline in energy prices, and, as the underlying trend in inflation steadily rises -- on the back of an improvement in the output gap and of an increase in medium- to long-term inflation expectations -- accelerate toward the price stability target of 2 percent. Assuming that crude oil prices will rise moderately from the recent level, the timing of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI reaching around 2 percent is projected to be during fiscal 2017. Next, I will explain the Bank's conduct of monetary policy. year, global financial markets had been volatile against the backdrop of the further decline in crude oil prices and uncertainty such as over future developments in emerging and commodity-exporting economies, particularly the Chinese economy. Under this situation, there was an increasing risk that an improvement in the business confidence of Japanese firms and conversion of the deflationary mindset might be delayed and that the underlying trend in inflation might be negatively affected. In order to preempt the manifestation of this risk and to maintain momentum toward achieving the price stability target of 2 percent, the interest rates already have been seen; namely, a substantial decline in the JGB yield curve and resultant clear declines in benchmark rates for business lending and in interest rates on housing loans. Going forward, these effects are likely to steadily spread to both the real economy and the price front. Nevertheless, it takes some time to see the penetration of monetary policy effects. In circumstances such as those in evidence today, where global financial markets remain volatile, partly due to uncertainties regarding the outlook for emerging economies and commodity-exporting economies, it could be even more difficult for positive changes to emerge. Against this backdrop, at the Monetary Policy Meeting held at the end of April, the Bank judged that it would be appropriate at present to examine the extent of the penetration of policy effects, and decided to maintain its current monetary policy. Risks to Japan's economic activity and prices remain skewed to the downside, with high uncertainty over the global economy and continuing volatile developments in financial markets. The Bank will examine risks to economic activity and prices at each monetary policy meeting, and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures in terms of three dimensions -- quantity, quality, and the interest rate -- if it is judged necessary for achieving the price stability target. By making full use of ""QQE with a Negative Interest Rate,"" the Bank will achieve the price stability target of 2 percent at the earliest possible time. Thank you.","['kumamoto', 'monetary', 'yen', 'funds', 'financial']","['kumamoto earthquake', 'bank japan', 'japan economy', 'japan economic', 'japan kumamoto']","['bank japan kumamoto', 'bank japan concerning', 'financial developments japan', 'kumamoto earthquake offer', 'suffering bank japan']"
3837,r171101a_BOJ,japan,2017-11-01,"Big Data - Its Impacts on Economies, Finance and Central Banking",nakaso,0,"It is a great pleasure to welcome you all today to the fourth meeting of the FinTech Forum. Today I would like to talk about big data and its utilization. The importance of data itself is not new to all of us. History tells us that many kings, lords, and governments, put their first priority on collecting data to understand their lands' geographies, populations, and taxable capacities. Furthermore, they made efforts to utilize the collected data. It has been the source of their political and economic power to collect high quality data and utilize it efficiently. Today, in light of the development of the Internet, smartphones, and SNS, the amount of data flowing into our society has been rapidly increasing. On the other hand, new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) enable us to process large volumes of data in a swift manner. Against the background of these rapid increases in the volume of data, and significant improvements in processing capacity, big data draws significant attention as a potential game-changer in our economy and society. To describe how data utilization has evolved over years, I would like to use the example of maps. Over the years, many people have attempted to make maps as accurate as possible, which have provided us with remarkable benefits. Even today we enjoy the benefits of using geographical data, such as ""Google Maps."" However, what is different from the past is that we are no longer users of data only. Our access logs to these services themselves constitute a new set of big data, and potentially have their own value to be utilized. In today's society, data is a kind of resource, and power belongs to those who are able to collect and efficiently utilize such big data. It is analogous to the economic power of countries with large amounts of petroleum resources, which was increased after they enhanced their processing capacity and sales channels. The world economy has also developed along with the evolution of data utilization. In this sense, one of the largest breakthroughs in economic history was the birth of money. When people exchanged goods, or bartered, the values of these goods were measured only in relative terms on a bilateral basis. However, the birth of money enabled them to use a common measure of value, and turned the value of each good into a datum, called a ""price."" Such price data also served as a foundation for the pricing mechanism to adjust the demand and supply of goods. Moreover, money made it much easier for people to trade with each other. Under the bartering system, each participant had to find a counterpart with a mutual demand for trading. However, money's intrinsic function of representing value, i.e. its price, has enabled people to trade without necessarily finding such a coincidence. Since money contains data about prices, it also made it easier to store wealth by keeping it in the form of money. This feature has also enabled us to do ""inter-temporal trading"", such as obtaining money by selling a fish yesterday and using it for the purchase of fruits tomorrow. As those episodes suggest, data utilization and the development of the economy have been strongly connected with each other. Today it is not an exaggeration to say that every economic activity is inseparable from collecting and processing data. For instance, demand forecasts, and production planning and inventory management by firms, consist of large amounts of data processing. Above all, the financial industry is one of the most data-oriented businesses. For example, the operations taking place on the back of our daily payments and settlements via credit cards, debit cards, or deposit accounts, can be regarded as data processing. Banks provide financial intermediation services through making complicated decisions and assessments on borrowers, interest rates, and assets for investments, by collecting and analyzing various types of data. Insurance companies design insurance policies and set their fees at appropriate levels by also collecting and analyzing data. These insurance schemes allow society to efficiently redistribute risks among various entities, and enhance its resiliency against future uncertainty. As such, the financial and insurance industries have indeed promoted economic growth in modern and post-modern society. Unlike tangible assets, information and data never depreciate. Data also has an interesting feature; that is, the marginal benefit of data may even increase as more data is collected and accumulated. In the past, collecting, storing, and processing, large amounts of data had been difficult in many cases due to technological constraints. Today however, the IT revolution has been changing the situation unprecedentedly and enabling efficient collection, storage, and processing, of gigantic amounts of data. This drastic change can be easily seen in the quantity of data. As the Internet, smartphones, and SNS, are expanding, the amount of data flowing in our economy is also increasing very rapidly. This is the emergence of big data. Moreover, in accordance with the IT revolution, more tactical and sophisticated methodologies for collecting data have become available. For example, unlike the past when doing paper-based surveys was the main instrument to collect customer data, firms have become able to obtain data without direct contacts with customers or individuals. For example, they can collect data that people disclose on the internet via SNS voluntarily, or that their customers input when conducting searches, or from e-commerce websites. Firms can also collect data even without their customers' explicit intention to provide data. For example, they can collect customers' data related to their purchasing activities by offering new digitized payment instruments, or obtain customer information by offering economic incentives such as special discounts to customers that provide their data through loyalty cards. Another remarkable change has been seen in the capacity to process data. Today we are becoming able to process big data very rapidly by utilizing innovative information technologies such as AI. Furthermore, a large amount of graphical or sound data, which was difficult to use in the past, is becoming easier to be efficiently utilized through technologies such as ""deep learning,"" in which AI automatically learns by itself through digesting such data. (Potential of big data on the economy) As such, rapid increases in the volume of data, and significant improvements in its processing capacity, are exerting a big influence on the economy and financial services. Currently, companies such as Google and Amazon, which are now at the world's top level of market capitalization, are collecting and leveraging big data through utilizing their platforms covering the world, and making it a source of their added-value and profits. In this regard, big data can be seen as a new type of ""asset,"" in terms of a profit source, instead of traditional fixed assets such as branches. Indeed, neither Google nor Amazon has physical ""branches"" in a traditional manner. Moreover, new businesses such as the sharing economy, can also be made possible by utilizing big data for connecting various idle resources and needs scattered all over the economy. For a wide range of companies, including giant global companies or new industries, the utilization of big data and AI may improve productivity in various ways, such as accurate analysis on demand, more efficient business processing, and enhancing added value. In emerging and developing countries with large populations, several e-commerce enterprises, backed by rapid popularization of smartphones, accumulate gigantic amounts of customer data, and the utilization of that data has facilitated the expansion of various businesses and economic activities in those countries. (Potential of big data on financial services) Big data may also extend the frontiers of financial services. Firstly, financial services themselves can be more sophisticated through effective use of big data. By using customers' transaction data to grasp their needs and analyze risks, it becomes easier to provide customized financial services tailored to each user, and to flexibly adjust the contents of services if necessary. For example in the field of insurance, in order to overcome ""adverse selection"" and ""moral hazard,"" which have been regarded as inherent problems in the insurance industry, efforts are being made to finely adjust the insurance fees by using a new technology known as a ""smart contract,"" and collecting a wide range of data such as how customers drive, and how they manage their health. Moreover, new authentication technologies such as biometrics authentication through big data analysis enable customers to use various financial services in a more secure manner. Secondly, big data may facilitate the networking of financial services with broad industries. For example, safe and efficient payment instruments are extremely important for e-commerce and the sharing economy. On the other hand, data obtained through these businesses can be useful for providing and customizing financial services. Consequently, new networks between financial services and various industries can be established, such as linking retail sales businesses with payments, loans, and insurance services. Thirdly, big data may also enhance financial stability through facilitating refined risk management and the efficient allocation of risks. However, when a variety of entities which are different from traditional financial service providers enter financial services, central banks are required to closely monitor their impacts on financial stability and their structures. Along with the enhanced utilization of big data, cyber security, data protection, and stakeholders' consent on the usage of big data, are becoming all the more important. Since ""trust"" has an important meaning especially in finance, these issues are becoming critical factors for maintaining the stability of payment settlement systems as well as financial systems. Recently, enormous amounts of non-anonymized data such as, who bought what, when, and where, are being collected. While such accumulation of non-anonymized data substantially enlarges the potential of data usage, the relevant entities are required to pay extremely careful attention to data protection and privacy. If people were to worry about the practices of managing big data and feel uneasy about their own privacy, it would become difficult to make big data contribute to economic development and welfare. Thus, I would like to ask all the relevant entities, who collect and utilize data, to pay due attention to ensuring data security. Big data also has substantial implications for central banking. All the operations and policy conduct of the central bank are closely linked with data collection and processing. Every operation including the settlement of funds and securities, and the processing of treasury funds through daily operations of the central bank's system, the core infrastructure of the economy, is made up of gigantic amounts of data processing. In carrying out macro policies such as monetary policy, it is an important precondition that policy entities including the central bank can collect and analyze various types of economic data quickly and efficiently, and timely grasp the developments of aggregate demand, general prices, and the impacts of policy actions on the economy and financial markets. Indeed, many central banks, including the Bank of Japan, are collecting and aggregating large amounts of data such as price statistics, corporate surveys, and financial market data, by themselves. Since central banks are processing as well as utilizing large amounts of data, central banks are required to continuously examine how to utilize and leverage new technologies for collecting, processing, and analyzing various types of data. I think that big data has great potential to vitalize various economic activities, innovate financial services, and increase economic welfare, as long as data security is firmly secured. In the well-known movie ""Moneyball,"" open-minded and thorough analysis of data, free of prejudice and convention, leads to the finding of new and advanced strategies that drastically change traditional baseball tactics. Also in volleyball, the current offense strategy with multiple options of attack including those from backguards, which is supported by precise data analysis, has been widely adopted in recent years, which I could not imagine when I was coaching high school students decades ago. As such, analysis and utilization of data has demonstrated its potential in various areas more than ever before. Given rapid increases in the volume of data and significant improvements in its processing capacity, I also have great expectations for the possibilities that utilizing data will increase opportunities for serendipity, that is, lucky encounters with unexpected discoveries or events, and will lead to creations that open up new frontiers. I believe that big data has huge potential to lead to new creations and value-added seeds which are free from prejudice, going beyond the psychological ""wall"" formed by conventional business customs. I think that such cases are already being seen. In order to maximize the opportunities for such serendipity, positive dialogues among a wide range of stakeholders are critical and indispensable. I would be very happy if this forum could become the place where such new creations and discoveries are made. I would like to close my remarks now by wishing that today's FinTech Forum be fruitful for all the participants. Thank you for your attention.","['maps', 'data', 'geographies', 'infrastructure', 'geographical']","['make maps', 'geographical data', 'maps years', 'data utilize', 'maps accurate']","['data google maps', 'data utilization evolved', 'make maps accurate', 'maps years people', 'data rapidly utilizing']"
3919,r191205a_BOJ,japan,2019-12-05,"Economic Activity, Prices, and Monetary Policy in Japan",harada,0,"Thank you for giving me this opportunity to exchange views with you and for having taken the time to be here despite your busy schedules. It is indeed a great honor to be here today. Please allow me to express my gratitude for your great cooperation with the business operations of the Bank of Japan, particularly of the Oita Branch. The Bank has implemented quantitative and qualitative monetary easing -- or QQE for short -- since April 2013 and introduced various additional measures such as the negative interest rate policy, yield curve control, strengthening the framework for continuous monetary easing, and clarification of forward guidance for policy rates, all with the aim of achieving the inflation target of 2 percent. As a result of these measures, Japan's economy has been improving. It is true that the economic expansion has not exactly been robust, reflecting such events as the consumption tax hike in fiscal 2014 from 5 percent to 8 percent, the latest hike in October 2019 from 8 percent to 10 percent, the slowdown in the global economy observed from mid-2015 through early 2016 and from the second half of 2018 to the present, and the downtrend in the working-age population. Nevertheless, the economy has managed to continue its expansion so far. Today, I would like to explain monetary policy measures conducted by the Bank and what they have achieved. First and foremost, the achievements are obvious. The unemployment rate has declined to its lowest level in nearly three decades and productivity has been increasing. The challenge lies elsewhere; namely, in the fact that prices have not been rising. It is increasingly being argued that interest rates consequently have remained low, eroding banks' profitability. However, I believe that the deterioration in banks' profitability is caused by the structural problem that banks are accumulating more deposits than they can lend. Banks therefore need to deal with this problem. Moreover, if interest rates were raised, this would lead to a decrease in the demand for loans, a decline in prices, an appreciation of the yen, an economic downturn, an increase in bankruptcies (raising banks' credit costs), and so forth. Therefore, raising interest rates would not solve the problem. Considering that the current low interest rates are partly attributable to the deflationary monetary policies pursued in the past, as I will describe later, the only way out is to maintain the current accommodative monetary policy in order to achieve sustained expansion of economic activity until we see increases in prices and interest rates. Table 1 presents an outline of the monetary policy measures conducted by the Bank since April 2013, when it introduced bold monetary policy. As a result of these measures, real interest rates -- nominal interest rates minus expected inflation rates -- have greatly declined due to the decrease in nominal interest rates and the rise in inflation expectations. The decline in real interest rates has stimulated investment, boosted stock prices in Japan, and led to a depreciation of the yen. Rising stock prices further raise investment and lead households that have become wealthier to increase their consumption expenditure. It is through these channels that economic activity started to improve. Next, I would like to explain my stance on the new forward guidance introduced in October 2019, which is shown in Table 1. The forward guidance in April 2019 stated that the Bank ""intends to maintain the current extremely low levels of short- and long-term interest rates for an extended period of time, at least through around spring 2020."" While I thought that clarifying the forward guidance was desirable, I opposed the policy proposal on the basis that the Bank should indicate data-dependent guidance to further clarify its link with the price stability target. Under the new guidance, the Bank ""expects short- and long-term interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels as long as it is necessary to pay close attention to the possibility that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target will be lost."" Although it is somewhat ambiguous, I voted for this proposal because the guidance became more akin to data-dependent guidance, in which the link to the price stability target is clearer, and allowed for the possibility of a future interest rate reduction. However, I continued to oppose allowing long-term yields to move in a more flexible manner. Since I already have elaborated on my reasons for this in the past, let me move on to the next topic. Improvement in economic activity can be seen in various fields. There are a lot of indicators that show improvement, such as employment, productivity, fiscal conditions, investment, exports, corporate profits, and wages; moreover, perceptions that the economy is recovering, the suicide rate, the income distribution, and women's entry into the labor market provide further indications of improvement. Of these indicators, I would like to talk today about the improvements in employment, productivity, and fiscal conditions. The improvement in employment is clear from the rise in the active job openings-to-applicants ratio, the decline in the unemployment rate, the increase in the number of employees, and other indicators. The increase in the number of employees is due to the rise in the employment rates of women and the elderly in particular. While there remains the issue that many of the women and the elderly are not regular but non-regular employees and only work short hours, the situation certainly is an improvement from the past. In an aging society, the fact that the employment rate of the elderly actually has risen holds great importance. The problem with an aging population is that the number of people who cannot work because of old age is increasing relative to the number of working-age people. It is worrying that it seems the ratio of the elderly (those aged 65 and over) to the working-age population (those aged 15-64) will rise from 47 percent in 2018 to 70 percent in 2045 (and then further rise moderately to 75 percent in 2065). However, if we assume that the working-age population comprises those aged 15-69 and the elderly population consists of those aged 70 and over, the ratio of the elderly to the working-age population will reach only 49 percent in 2045 and 55 percent in 2065. Looked at this way, the increase in the employment rate of the elderly brought about by monetary easing can be regarded as good news for Japan's aging society. Next, I would like to look at the employment situation, focusing on the employment environment for the young. Chart 1 shows the unemployment rate, the youth unemployment rate, and the job offer rates for university students as of October and December of the year before they graduate and as of February and April of the year of graduation. mentioned earlier, the overall unemployment rate has declined almost consistently, marking 2.4 percent in October 2019. While the youth unemployment rate usually is higher and tends to be more volatile than the overall unemployment rate, this also has been declining steadily. In addition, the job offer rates for the respective months have registered record highs. While figures for the job offer rates are only available from 1997, the rates must have been high during the bubble period and lower after the burst of the bubble, given that they are negatively correlated with the youth unemployment rate. The shaded areas in the chart represent the so-called ""employment ice age."" If the unemployment rate had been lowered through monetary policy, there might not have been such an employment ice age, or at least it might have been mitigated. The Bank started QQE in April 2013, but if it had been introduced earlier, the unemployment rate in Japan without doubt would have remained in the range of 2.0-3.0 percent throughout. Since the unemployment rate from the mid-1990s to 2012 on average was roughly 4.5 percent, the current unemployment rate of 2.4 percent means that the unemployment rate has almost halved. This decline in the unemployment rate also has helped to raise productivity, which I will touch on next. Productivity also has been rising in tandem with the improvement in employment. Since I have talked about this in the past, here I only would like to note that it has been rising. me just briefly summarize the reason behind this occurrence. When an economy is in recession, firms curtail investment in physical assets, human resources, and research and development. Young people caught up in the employment ice age missed out on on-the-job training opportunities. Although it is impossible to make up all the lost ground, some of it can be slowly gained over time, helping to gradually raise the productivity of the economy. Bold monetary easing has stimulated economic activity, increased tax revenues, and improved fiscal conditions. Chart 2 presents the ratios relative to nominal GDP of the general government fiscal balance, gross government debt outstanding, and net government debt outstanding. The GDP ratio of the general government deficit has decreased by 5.6 percentage points from 8.3 percent in fiscal 2012 to 2.7 percent in fiscal 2017, and the GDP ratio of net government debt, which had been increasing sharply, is more or less unchanged at around 121 percent since fiscal 2012. Let me explain the importance of net government debt. Net government debt is calculated by subtracting government financial assets from gross government debt. It used to be argued that, although Japan's gross government debt was substantial, this was not a problem because net government debt was not that large. However, at present, net government debt is actually also fairly large. Net government debt matters when considering the possibility of government debt default. While some argue that, given the large amount of government debt, even a small increase in interest rates could cause serious problems, it is important to think about the impact in terms of net debt. The reason is that when interest rates rise, interest receipts on financial assets held by the government also increase, partly cancelling out the impact on gross government debt. Since the introduction of QQE, employment has been improving, productivity has been rising, and fiscal conditions have been improving. What, then, is at the core of the problem of bold monetary policy? Simply put, prices have not been rising. Prior to the introduction of QQE, the Bank decided that it would aim to achieve inflation of 2 percent. However, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI) excluding fresh food for October 2019 is 0.4 percent, a long way off the target. You might think that it is not a problem that prices are not rising if employment is improving, productivity is rising, and fiscal conditions are improving. However, if prices do not rise, neither will interest rates, which poses a problem for financial institutions. When asked ""Why are interest rates in Japan low?"" one might answer: ""Because that is the Bank's very intention."" However, this is not necessarily the case. From a theoretical perspective, maintaining interest rates at low levels will cause the economy to overheat and prices to rise, possibly resulting in inflation that significantly exceeds 2 percent. In order to avoid this, interest rates will need to be raised. Alternatively, they will rise over time in due course. In a nutshell, in the long term, a low interest rate policy brings about increases in prices and nominal interest rates. Looked at from a different angle, what this means is that Japan fell into deflation and a situation of low interest rates because interest rates were not lowered sufficiently during economic downturns in the past. Moreover, this decline in interest rates is actually not unique to Japan, but rather a global phenomenon. Chart 3 shows 10-year government bond yields for major countries. For visual clarity, each point represents a five-year average. Interest rates have been declining globally and, although not visible in the chart, 10-year government bond yields have been negative in Japan, Germany, and France since around the middle of 2019. Low interest rates reflect low rates of both real economic growth and inflation. Let us look at the nominal GDP growth rate, which is the sum of these two rates. As can be seen in Chart 4, nominal GDP growth rates of major countries have been declining on the whole. While nominal GDP growth rates have indeed been declining, this alone cannot fully explain the decline in interest rates. In Chart 5, the vertical axis represents 10-year government bond yields, while the horizontal axis represents the nominal GDP growth rates of major countries. Each dot in the chart depicts the five-year average for each country from 1990 to the present. Up until the 2000s, interest rates moved in sync with nominal GDP growth rates and were around 2 percentage points higher than them. However, looking at the trend since the second half of the 2010s, interest rates have fallen 2 percentage points below nominal GDP growth rates and have failed to rise substantially when nominal GDP growth rates increased to some extent. However, because it is only since the start of 2010 that interest rates have been below nominal GDP growth rates, the situation might change quickly and interest rates may rise swiftly if nominal GDP growth rates increase. Therefore, we might not have to expect the situation of the past five to ten years to last forever. Why did interest rates fall more than the nominal GDP growth rate? Proposed explanations for the decline in interest rates, in addition to the decline in the rates of inflation and real GDP growth, include changes in the saving-investment balance. Various factors are said to be responsible for such changes: demographic forces; higher inequality; the glut of precautionary saving by emerging markets; the decline in the relative price of capital; the high profitability of large IT firms and their large cash reserves; lower public investment; the shortage of safe assets; and the improvement in fiscal conditions. Some argue that the recent decline in interest rates is cyclical and changes in the saving-investment balance might be due to the decline in investment and increase in savings, and that this has led to the decline in interest rates. Among the reasons behind the decline in interest rates mentioned earlier, I will focus on the effects of the improvement in fiscal conditions in Japan. First, let us assume that interest rates in Japan are determined by the saving-investment balance in Japan. Another assumption is that a change in fiscal conditions does not affect private-sector decisions with regard to saving and investment. In fiscal 2012, long-term interest rates in Japan were 0.8 percent, while gross national savings, which equal total investment -- the sum of domestic and foreign investment -- amounted to 115 trillion yen. The general government deficit declined by 26 trillion yen from fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2017. Due to this decline, gross national savings should have increased by 26 trillion yen. Chart 6 shows the relationship between interest rates and gross national savings, which equal total investment. As the interest elasticity of savings is said to be small, the supply curve of savings is almost vertical. Meanwhile, the investment demand curve is drawn assuming that the interest elasticity of investment is one. The chart indicates that interest rates declined by 0.18 percentage points due to the decline in the general government deficit by 26 trillion yen. While it is difficult to judge whether this decline in interest rates is large or small, what is clear is that, if the government deficit led to a rise in interest rates, this would pose a major problem, as it would reduce important investment and damage Japan's economy in the future; on the other hand, if the government deficit does not lead to a rise in interest rates, it also does not reduce important investment, and would not be a major problem. In addition to the debate surrounding low interest rates mentioned earlier, it has been argued that the low interest rate policy allows inefficient firms to survive, leading to a decline in productivity and, consequently, a decline in the natural rate of interest. This could be called the ""zombie firm argument"" -- that is, the argument that low interest rates artificially keep inefficient firms alive. Yet another argument is that the current low interest rates are due to low interest rates in the past that brought about a ""frontloading"" of demand and resulted in a further decline in interest rates. First of all, it needs to be noted that these arguments focus on real, not nominal, interest rates. Thus, as for the first argument that the low interest rate policy allows inefficient firms to survive, leading to a decline in productivity, this is implausible given that productivity has been rising as a result of QQE. In addition, if inefficient firms were forced to exit the market because of higher interest rates, this would lead to employment issues. In contrast, Japan's economy is currently facing labor shortages due to monetary easing. If inefficient firms are to be forced to exit the market, it is much better if this occurs through labor shortages and upward wage pressures. With regard to the second argument that the current low interest rates are merely the result of a ""frontloading"" of future demand, both production and people's incomes have been rising. I assume that when people have higher incomes, they are likely to demand a higher standard of living in the future as well. Owing to the stable exchange rate environment brought about by QQE, more foreign visitors have been coming to Japan. I feel that it is rather strange to think that Japan has merely attracted visitors that were expected to come in the future and that, since these visitors will not come in the future, this would lead to a decline of the economy in the future. When the Bank introduced QQE, I assumed that achieving the inflation target of 2 percent would not take much time. If the inflation rate were to approach 2 percent, the Bank would have to raise interest rates. I therefore did not expect interest rates to stay at around 0 percent or in negative territory for such a long period of time. It seems that many economists had similar expectations. Let me go back to the discussion regarding the factors underlying low interest rates. Given that interest rates have fallen 2 percentage points below nominal GDP growth rates, the decrease in the fiscal deficit mentioned earlier cannot fully explain the low interest rates. In fact, the reasons why interest rates have fallen so much are not yet fully understood. However, given that interest rates in the United Kingdom and the United States -- where inflation rates of around 2 percent had been successfully maintained -- have remained higher than interest rates in Japan, it is clear that Japan's past deflationary monetary policy has led to the decline in interest rates. In addition, it is only for the last five or ten years that interest rates have been 2 percentage points below nominal GDP growth rates. Therefore, we might not have to expect this situation to last forever. Although it is not clear why, interest rates have fallen globally and are negative, not only in Japan but also in many European countries. Banks are dissatisfied with low interest rates. While these have improved the employment situation and boosted productivity, it frequently is argued that they undermine banks' profitability. Before considering the relationship between low interest rates and banks' profitability, I would like to explain banks' functions. How do banks make profits? Textbooks on finance define the functions of banks as consisting of information production and asset transformation and explain banks' profits as the result of performing these two functions. As for information production, banks, on behalf of depositors, examine borrowers' future profits from investments and the quality of their assets, assess whether the projected outcome has been achieved after a loan was made, and check whether borrowers' accounting information is correct. Banks demand collateral and/or personal guarantees from borrowers. Sufficient collateral and personal guarantees alleviate banks' burdens of monitoring firms' accounting information and therefore reduce the cost of information production. Since depositors cannot demand collateral or personal guarantees, the function of information production falls on banks. If firms provided more detailed accounting information, given that they are sufficiently large, they could obtain funding through capital markets and would not have to rely on bank lending. The reason that in practice most large firms in Japan borrow from banks is that banks provide inexpensive lending to them. This means that lending to large firms is less profitable for banks. While it is very difficult to project future profits to begin with, there are certain firms other than banks that can project the future profits of another firm more accurately. For instance, a large assembler to a certain extent knows the sales figures of its suppliers. The simple reason is that the assembler procures orders from the supplier. Similarly, trading and other companies that take part in the management of particular firms may also be better placed to project their future profits. Banks compete with such firms with information advantages. Even if the firms they lend to are very successful, the margin that banks can earn is very small. Since banks are not allowed to invest depositors' money, they cannot invest in venture firms and earn returns that are considerable multiples of their outlays. If banks try to assess the future profits of a firm, which are unknowable, it is the person with the greatest authority that ultimately makes the assessment. If a firm is not managed properly, it likely would face a situation illustrated in the world of novels -- that is, the credit examination division would stop functioning and the human resources division, which is responsible for assessing personnel, would engage in internal power struggles. banks instead provide loans based only on observable and objective criteria such as collateral, they could cut costs by substantially downsizing their credit examination division and/or human resources division. That is, banks should lend based on observable and objective criteria and examine future profits of firms only in exceptional circumstances. Even by focusing only on the examination of observable and objective criteria, banks would be doing something that depositors cannot. Asset transformation -- banks' other function -- consists of two components. The first is the act of accumulating short-term deposits and transforming them into long-term lending. Since borrowers use funds to buy machinery or construct buildings, they cannot pay back the money on short notice. Banks can lend over the long term by accumulating deposits from a large number of depositors. The second component is the transformation of loan assets, which entail the possibility of default, into risk-free deposits. As a result, depositors can rest assured that their funds are safe when entrusting them to banks. This means that banks transform assets that involve risks into safe assets through the function of information production. To what extent can banks maintain the amount of loans by utilizing these functions? There are some landowners that only have a small amount of deposits, but their deposits would increase if they succeed in their business. If the quality of people's lives improves, the number of people who can let their assets lie idle over the long term would increase, leading to a narrowing of the spread between short- and long-term interest rates. As some borrow money even at high interest rates, banks might be able to make loans to them at such rates. However, these people do not represent the majority. Banks can make loans even without sufficient collateral. If a borrower makes a certain down payment to start up a shop, banks can place confidence in the borrower's diligence and steadiness. Even if the amount of collateral is not sufficient for banks, the borrower certainly should be considered serious enough, since all the efforts made over several years would be in vain upon failure. In the case of housing loans, a 10-20 percent down payment might be insufficient for banks. However, it seems that such a down payment level would not cause problems because borrowers would want to keep their houses at all costs. Looking at banks' assets, as of end-September 2019, of the total loans made by domestically licensed banks of 509 trillion yen, 324 trillion yen was for corporations (including 206 trillion yen for small enterprises) and 144 trillion yen for households. As for loans to households, as of end-September 2019, the amount of housing loans was 131 trillion yen and that of consumer loans was 10 trillion yen. I assume that the total amount of loans -- those to small enterprises and households combined -- with which banks might be able to gain profits is around 350 trillion yen. Though based on different statistics, as of end-August 2019, of the total loans of 485 trillion yen, the amount of loans made at interest rates of 5 percent or more only stood at 5.9 trillion yen. An increase in deposits in excess of the increase in loans at banks also is a problem. Chart 7 shows the loan-to-deposit ratios (calculated by dividing loans by deposits) of banks in Japan, had been at around 100 percent through the end of the 1990s, declined sharply thereafter and is hovering at around 60 percent at present. On the other hand, the ratios in the other countries, albeit declining, have remained at around 100 percent except in the United States. Banks in those countries accumulate deposits only to the extent necessary to make loans. Even then, banks in Europe have had difficulties maintaining profitability. For banks in Japan that have been accumulating an excessive amount of deposits, the situation should become even more severe. From the time of the introduction of QQE up until September 2019, loans by domestically licensed banks, which had been on a declining trend, increased by 79 trillion yen while deposits increased by as much as 161 trillion yen. In this context, news reports suggest that financial institutions are struggling to attract personnel and that staff members are retiring early. While this is reported as though it is troublesome, it consequently could lead to a reduction in the number of personnel contributing to the collection of more deposits than needed and in that of branches. I think that this would increase the productivity of the banking sector, and thus of Japan's economy as a whole. There are concerns that, facing difficulties in expanding lending while accumulating too much deposits, banks in Japan do not seem to be trying to reduce deposits, but instead are relying on riskier lending or investment and recommending that their customers buy investment trusts rather than make deposits. Estimates by the Financial Services Agency (FSA) of customers' total return on investment trusts (after fees and commissions) suggest that, as of end-March 2019, 34 percent of customers of all investment trust distributors face negative total returns. Given that the average holding period of such funds is thought to be around three years and that stock prices in major countries have risen during that period, including in Japan, where the Nikkei 225 Stock Average has risen by around 25 percent, the return on most funds should be positive. This means that the negative returns must be due to high fees and commissions. As highlighted by the FSA, some of the distributors of investment trusts seem to be encouraging their customers to churn between funds in the short term to gain profits from transaction fees. Moreover, looking at the costs and returns of investment trust funds by type of distributor, I find that banks and securities firms engaged in face-to-face sales tend to sell trusts involving high costs and low returns. In contrast, independent investment trust firms and securities firms specializing in sales via the internet tend to sell trusts at a lower cost and that offer higher returns. Some financial institutions in Europe, where interest rates also are low, are in the process of significantly enhancing their business efficiency due to the prolonged sluggishness of profits. Since drastic employment adjustments in Europe seem to be difficult due to factors such as labor practices, some financial institutions are revising their organizational structure globally, including in Japan. Given that Japan is facing labor shortages due to bold monetary easing, such revisions should be easier than in Europe. If banks successfully can downsize their number or their asset holdings, they would become profitable. In capitalism and a market economy, firms need to switch from unprofitable to profitable business areas. If banks release human resources and capital while making this shift, this will have a positive impact on Japan's economy as a whole. Although I recognize the difficulty of giving up business in Japan, if banks -- which should form the core of capitalism and the market economy -- understand this point, I believe productivity of the economy will improve greatly. Nearly seven years have passed since the introduction of bold monetary easing in 2013, and almost five years have passed since I was appointed as a Member of the Policy Board of the Bank. Even now, achieving the inflation target of 2 percent seems to be a long way off. Interest rates have not been rising due to low inflation. However, owing to bold monetary easing, economic activity clearly has improved. Employment, especially youth employment, has improved. Had the Bank implemented bold monetary easing since the 1990s, the employment ice age could have been avoided. There also have been various other positive developments, as I mentioned earlier. However, since interest rates have not been rising, banks, which believe their profits would increase with higher interest rates, express growing dissatisfaction. In my opinion, banks' low profitability is caused by the structural problem that they are accumulating more deposits than they can lend and the banking sector as a whole therefore will not be able to maintain its current size. As shown in Chart 5, it is only over the past ten years or so that interest rates have failed to rise to any meaningful extent, and thus it might be premature to conclude that it is not possible to see a return to the former situation. If the Bank were to raise interest rates now, this would revive the deflationary mindset and consequently further delay increases in prices and interest rates. This would not benefit the banking sector either. Some argue that the Bank should raise interest rates soon because Japan's economy is in a good state given the demographic trends. However, it was only after the introduction of QQE that real GDP per working-age person started to increase; therefore, raising interest rates would just throw us back. That is, raising interest rates would lead to the following: an appreciation of the yen; falling stock prices; declines in exports, investment, consumption and employment; and the reemergence of the employment ice age.

3958,r210513a_BOJ,japan,2021-05-13,The Bank's Semiannual Report on Currency and Monetary Control ,kuroda,1,"Statement by KURODA Haruhiko, Governor of the Bank of Japan, concerning the before the Committee on The Bank of Japan submits to the Diet its every June and December. I am pleased to have this opportunity today to talk about recent economic and financial developments and present an overall review of the Bank's conduct of monetary policy. I will first explain recent economic and financial developments. Japan's economic activity has been pushed down recently, mainly in the face-to-face services sector, such as eating and drinking as well as accommodations. This is because public health measures have been implemented, such as the state of emergency declared in some regions, amid the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) spreading along with an increase in variant cases. On the other hand, exports and production have continued to increase on the back of overseas economies recovering on the whole. Business fixed investment has picked up due to improvement in corporate profits. In sum, Japan's economy has picked up as a trend, although it has remained in a severe situation due to the impact of COVID-19. With regard to the outlook, although the level of economic activity, mainly in the face-to-face services sector, is expected to be lower than that prior to the pandemic for the time being, the economy is likely to recover, with the impact of COVID-19 waning gradually and supported by an increase in external demand, accommodative financial conditions, and the government's economic measures. The year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI) has been slightly negative and is likely to remain so for the time being, mainly affected by COVID-19 and a reduction in mobile phone charges. However, when excluding the effects of temporary factors that push down prices, it has been slightly positive. Regarding the outlook, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is expected to turn positive and then increase gradually on the back of economic activity continuing to improve and the effects of the temporary factors dissipating. Risks to the aforementioned outlook for economic activity and prices are skewed to the downside for the time being. The consequences of COVID-19 and their impact on the economy are unclear. In addition, it is likely that growth expectations will not decline substantially and financial system stability will be maintained, but this outlook also entails uncertainties. Regarding financial risks from a longer-term perspective, there is a possibility that prolonged downward pressure on financial institutions' profits may lead to a gradual pullback in financial intermediation. On the other hand, the vulnerability of the financial system could increase, mainly due to the search for yield behavior. Therefore, it is necessary to pay close attention to future developments. Next, I will explain the Bank's conduct of monetary policy. Monetary Easing. Based on the findings, the Bank judged it important to continue with monetary easing in a sustainable manner and make nimble and effective responses to counter changes in the situation, with a view to achieving the price stability target of 2 percent. It therefore decided mainly on the following three policy actions. First, the Bank established the Interest Scheme to Promote Lending so that it could cut short- and long-term interest rates nimbly while taking into consideration the functioning of financial intermediation. Second, in order to conduct yield curve control flexibly during normal times, the Bank made clear that the range of 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) yield fluctuations would be between around plus and minus 0.25 percent from the target level of around zero percent. At the same time, it introduced ""fixed-rate purchase operations for consecutive days"" as a powerful tool to set an upper limit on interest rates when necessary. Third, with regard to the purchases of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the Bank decided to maintain the upper limit -- which was originally set as a temporary measure in response to the impact of COVID-19 -- of about 12 trillion yen on the annual pace of increase in its amount outstanding even after COVID-19 subsides and to conduct the purchases as necessary with this upper limit while taking into account market conditions. which sustainability and nimbleness have been enhanced owing to these policy actions, the Bank will persistently continue to conduct powerful monetary easing with a view to achieving the price stability target of 2 percent. On this basis, it is important to address the impact of COVID-19 for the time being, and thus the Bank will continue to support financing, mainly of firms, and maintain stability in financial markets through monetary easing measures such as the Special Program to Support Thank you.","['economy', 'economic', 'economies', 'pandemic', 'monetary']","['japan economy', 'japan economic', 'bank japan', 'japan concerning', 'recent economic']","['japan economic activity', 'developments japan economic', 'financial developments japan', 'sum japan economy', 'bank japan concerning']"
3981,r220209a_BOJ,japan,2022-02-09,"Economic Activity, Prices, and Monetary Policy in Japan",nakamura,0,"I will begin my speech by talking about recent developments in economic activity and prices. Overseas economies have recovered on the whole, albeit with variation across countries and In advanced economies, resumption of economic activity continues as vaccination has progressed, while priority public health measures have been taken to respond specifically to the spread of the Omicron variant. Emerging and commodity-exporting economies have generally picked up on the back of progress with vaccinations. Against this background, a pick-up in Japan's economy has become evident (Chart 2). Exports and production continue on an uptrend, albeit with the effects of supply-side constraints. A pick-up in private consumption has also become evident since early autumn 2021, although downward pressure due to the spread of the Omicron variant has recently been a cause for concern. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI) for all items less fresh food, or core CPI, despite being affected by the reduction in mobile phone charges, has been slightly positive, reflecting price rises in energy and other items Japan's economy is likely to recover as the impact of COVID-19 and the effects of supply- side constraints gradually wane. The year-on-year rate of change in the core CPI is also likely to increase in positive territory due to a dissipation of the effects of a reduction in mobile phone charges on the back of a moderate pass-through of raw material cost increases. This outlook is subject to a number of uncertainties; specifically, I am particularly attentive to the following factors. The first is the Chinese economy, sometimes referred to as ""the world's market"" or ""the workshop of the world."" There is a risk that the spread of the Omicron variant under China's zero-Covid policy will lead to globally prolonged supply-side constraints and protracted inflationary pressures, in addition to pushing down the global economy. Attention should also be paid to such factors as the aging population, intensified conflict between China and both the United States and Europe, and the decline in medium- to long-term growth potential mainly due to the imposition of stronger restrictions. The second factor is firms' price-setting behavior. Uncertainties surround future developments in the pass-through of raw material cost increases, leaving potential for movement in either direction. If cost increases are not passed on sufficiently, this could cause firms to fall into a vicious cycle where their business performance will deteriorate, making it inevitable that they will cut wages and investment for the future. On the other hand, the pass- through of cost increases may also proceed further than expected; firms have recently become increasingly sensitive to inflation, with upstream price rises gradually spreading to downstream (Chart 4). I consider it crucial for firms' price-setting stance to become active in order for Japan's economy to shift toward a new growth path and to achieve the Bank's price stability target. The third factor is a change in households' preference for holding on to their cash and deposits. The amount outstanding of households' cash and deposits continued to grow, increasing by 44 trillion yen relative to the pre-pandemic trend, and reaching 1,072 trillion yen as of end- result in a materialization of pent-up demand, thereby stimulating economic activity. In fact, with the younger generation in particular having been showing greater interest in financial asset investment, it is hoped -- as I will elaborate on later -- that if households can reap the fruits of global economic growth by gaining stable income through the dividends from their investment in financial assets, this will help bring about a virtuous cycle of growth and distribution in the long run. At the same time, these trends naturally weaken when households lower their growth expectations for Japanese firms. I am therefore paying close attention to how these trends develop alongside firms' efforts toward achieving growth. The fourth factor is investment behavior, particularly among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The amount outstanding of cash and deposits has been on an increasing trend for both large enterprises and SMEs. In contrast, net interest-bearing debt -- the difference between interest-bearing debt and cash and deposits -- has been decreasing as a trend among SMEs, unlike large enterprises, showing no clear increase since 2018 (Chart 6). Shifting our focus to business fixed investment for fiscal 2021, large enterprises across all industries have been in line with past averages, maintaining a 9 percent-plus increase over the previous fiscal year. In contrast, the Bank of Japan's December 2021 Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan) shows that business fixed investment for SMEs across all industries, which tends to be revised upward through the fiscal year-end, has been relatively weak (Chart 7). Attention should be paid to whether SMEs strengthen their stance of cutting investment and hoarding cash and deposits, as this will delay a long-standing challenge to Japan's economy, namely, raising productivity. Let me now turn to the Bank's policy conduct. The Bank has conducted powerful monetary easing in response to COVID-19 since March 2020 through the following three measures: (1) the Special Program to Support Financing in funds; and (3) purchases of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs). The Bank's responses have had positive effects, coupled with the government's measures and active efforts by financial institutions, and financial conditions in Japan have been accommodative on the whole. That said, weakness remains in the financial positions of firms in some segments, such as the face-to-face services industry, and of small and medium-sized firms. There also continues to be significant uncertainty surrounding the impact of COVID-19, including the spread of the Omicron variant. Against this background, the Bank decided in December 2021 to extend the Special Program in part by six months with a view to doing its utmost to support financing, mainly of small and medium-sized firms (Chart 8). The Bank will continue to closely monitor any changes in the situation, including those related to the impact of COVID-19, and take appropriate measures. On this basis, it will persistently continue with the current powerful monetary easing to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent. In the meantime, since climate change could exert an extremely large impact on developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions from a medium- to long-term perspective, the Bank has implemented as one of its policy responses a fund-provisioning measure to support private financial institutions' various efforts in fields related to climate change. It conducted its first operation under the measure in December 2021, through which funds amounting to more than 2 trillion yen were provided. The result of the operation seems to indicate that financial institutions have already made a certain amount of climate change- related investment or loans. This raises the possibility that investment made by firms to address climate change, including by small and medium-sized firms, will be larger than anticipated. While this is expected to bring about a long-term expansion in domestic investment, the Bank will continue to closely monitor firms' initiatives and investment plans. I would now like to share my view on structural changes in Japan's economy and efforts to transform the economic system from a longer-term perspective, based on my own experience at a private firm I worked at from 1975 to 2020. The business model that drove Japan's export-led growth from the rapid economic growth period through 1984 was set against the backdrop of Japan's stable political and economic environment during the Cold War and a depreciation of the yen. It was characterized by concentrated domestic investment in cheaply manufacturing high-quality products in existing product areas, such as automobiles and household electrical appliances, and selling them to the world. Meanwhile, so-called Japan Inc. was formed, built around (1) long-term employment practices marked by lifetime employment and the seniority system, (2) long- term business relationships, such as the main bank system and corporate relationships with subcontractors and affiliates, and (3) government-corporate cooperation channeled through administrative guidance and industry organizations. This integrated system also underpinned the country's export-led growth aimed at catching up with other advanced economies. However, drastic changes took place in Japan's economic environment from the latter half of the 1980s -- for instance, the yen's rapid appreciation following the Plaza Accord, the completion of the catching-up process, the end of the Cold War, advances in globalization, and the rise of emerging economies. Japan entered an era in which growth required risk taking, and its economic system stood in need of transformation to adapt to the new era. However, such transformation was postponed, with firms burdened by the ""three excesses"" in employment, production capacity, and debt, mainly due to the economic bubble and its bursting. Even from the late 1990s into the new millennium, at the time of the Asian financial crisis and the bursting of the U.S. dot-com bubble, long-term employment practices and other obstacles hampered many Japanese firms from pushing through the realignment of their business portfolios, which would have enhanced their value-added. Faced with deteriorating business performance, they responded by overhauling their cost structure, cutting costs in, for example, labor -- including investment in human resources -- research and development gave rise to excessive competition among firms in Japan and a continued decline in prices. Furthermore, long-term deflation made the recovery of investment costs increasingly unlikely, which, along with other factors including those just mentioned, caused more firms to shy away from investment and the pursuit of innovation. Japan's economy then suffered two crises, namely, the 2008 Global Financial Crisis and the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011, both of which coincided with firms being faced with so-called six headwinds, including a historically strong yen. To adapt to the headwinds, large enterprises in the manufacturing sector made further inroads overseas and increased their capacity for generating earnings abroad despite the strong yen. Outward direct investment, including that by the nonmanufacturing sector, began to expand further around 2013, and continues even now to contribute to Japan's stable current account surplus trend through the surplus in primary income -- or the positive balance associated with foreign investment (Chart 9). However, these developments have been seen primarily in large enterprises; there is still an ongoing financial surplus in the corporate sector. On this point, if firms do not actively make investments, innovation in creating new products, services, and businesses will fall short, as was the case during Japan's long-term deflationary period. Partly due to a decline in growth expectations, households that receive wages from firms will in turn hold back on spending and investment, hoarding more of their deposits. Even if firms make efforts to sustain demand with price cuts, funds from households will likely decrease. Firms will then further hold back on investments, leading to a greater lack of innovation and reduced flow of funds; as a result, the economy will slip into low growth (see Chart 10 for a simplified representation). That said, Japan's economy is in the midst of a sea change. Of the six headwinds, the issues of a historically strong yen, delayed creation of EPAs, and high corporate tax rates can be said to have been mostly resolved. In particular, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement 2022, have lowered barriers to exports and overseas expansion, raising hopes of more aggressive corporate activities taking advantage of these frameworks. Meanwhile, digitalization and climate change response, which are considered to be key areas of Japan's growth strategy, require sustainable large-scale domestic investment involving numerous firms across the value chain. Moreover, as firms revisit the value chain, we are likely to see some SMEs and startups experiencing significant growth, mainly through business realignment. This could, in turn, spur the creation of new businesses and products and promote growth in new areas of demand. My hope is that the revival of such dynamism will change the excessive savings mindset among firms; boost the flow of funds as investments in, for example, equipment, software, R&D, human resources, and merger and acquisition (M&A) activities stimulate further investments; and realize new economic growth and a sustained increase in wages (see Chart 11 for a simplified representation of this virtuous To bring about such a virtuous cycle, it will be necessary to overcome the dearth of dynamism -- a major challenge for Japan's economy -- in tandem with the transition to a post-pandemic society. In particular, the Japanese-style employment system rooted in long-term employment practices, including seniority-based wages and internal promotions, will need to be reformed, as will the country's rigid labor market. The Japanese-style employment system was effective in an era of steady growth in supply and demand through exports and domestic industrial clusters, with growth being driven through process innovation, exemplified by kaizen in the so-called VUCA era, which is characterized by the creation of high value through intangible assets and growth that requires risk taking, it is not easy for individual firms to sustain growth by going it alone. If firms become fixated on maintaining all of their business lines, they will be slow to realign their business portfolios and will end up losing focus. As excessive costs build up and profits decline in such firms, growth in employee wages will end up being constrained, which will in turn increase concerns regarding the future. It should be noted that, from fiscal 2022, Japan's baby boomer generation will begin moving into the category of advanced elderly. Greater labor force participation by women and seniors contributed to economic growth over the past decade. However, as further increase in the labor force participation rate proves difficult, the more pressing need will be to improve productivity (Chart 12). On the one hand, boosting productivity will require business owners to emphasize the growth of both the business and its human capital; they will need to consolidate less productive businesses under their best owners (companies that are expected to maximize the value of the business over the medium to long term); and they will have to channel resources into growth businesses such as through M&A activities. On the other hand, I think it is critical for both firms and households to be forward-looking in their actions to achieve growth and affluence, with, for example, individuals continually pursuing self- betterment to gain knowledge and skills that lead to greater added value. From this perspective, it is also vital to develop both a social safety net and a sustainable social security system that encourage active risk taking. For example, corporate pensions are a key factor in enabling working people of child-rearing age to change jobs without adding to their anxiety about post-retirement years. To encourage the broader adoption of corporate pension plans among SMEs, the Japanese government introduced in 2018 a simplified small and medium-sized businesses. Although the government has since continued to refine the plan to make it available to a wider range of people, the number of iDeCo+ subscribers still stands at around a mere 23,000. Looking at trends among people changing jobs by size of enterprise, the number of people moving between large enterprises and from SMEs to large enterprises has increased significantly, while the number of those moving between SMEs and from large enterprises to SMEs has declined or remained flat. It is possible that the issue of pension plans may be one of the reasons labor migration to SMEs has not increased (Chart 13). Realizing new growth in Japan's economy will require smooth labor migration into growth businesses, including startups. I look to corporate managers, financial institutions, and local administrations to accelerate their efforts to this end. There is a growing trend around the world to step up efforts to build a new form of capitalism that is focused on sustainability and human capital to generate new investment and growth. The government is positioning Japan to take the lead in this trend. The emergency proposal announced by the Council of New Form of Capitalism Realization in November 2021 is a comprehensive statement, encompassing strategies for both growth and distribution. particular, I would like to offer my opinion on what is involved in reviving the dynamism of Japanese firms and reinforcing investment in human capital. Sustained growth in income is generated by economic growth, and economic growth is generated by innovation arising from sustained corporate growth investment. I think the key to this innovation lies in the revival of corporate dynamism and the development of the human resources necessary to pursue new businesses. My impression is that the risk aversion in the so-called VUCA era has led to a dearth of innovation. According to statistics from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the percentage of firms in Japan that have brought new products and services to the market is 9.9 percent for the manufacturing sector and 4.9 percent for the services sector. This is considerably lower than the 18.8 percent in manufacturing and 9.0 percent in services in Germany and the 12.7 percent and 7.6 percent in the United States. Japan has historically excelled at process innovation, but with advances in digitalization, the country now lags far behind in this area as well. Among U.S. firms, digitization (converting analog or paper-based data into digital format) and digitalization (digitalizing individual business operations and manufacturing processes) have streamlined and made more efficient the workforces of existing businesses while creating new employment opportunities in growth businesses. It seems to have been difficult for these mechanisms to gain traction among Japanese firms, and this has led to delays in digitalization. However, advanced economies are pursuing digital transformation (DX) not chiefly to reform the cost structure but rather to move toward a business model in which data creates value. Meanwhile, the expansion of cloud-based services has lowered hurdles to digitalization, for instance, by enabling lower-cost and faster implementation. This, I believe, provides firms with the opportunity to step up the pace of transformation of their business models and make significant headway into new stages of growth. Furthermore, for Japan to take the lead in areas such as digitalization and climate change response, the growth of startups that can carry forward such initiatives will be critical. The number of Japanese startups has been on the rise in recent years. However, Japan's entry and exit rates remain low compared to other advanced economies (Chart 14). A survey of Japanese entrepreneurs reported ""fear of failure"" as the biggest reason for the low number of business start-ups in Japan. It is important to foster an environment that is supportive of second chances, by for example expanding the safety net, and thereby promote a positive approach to taking on challenges. Few startups experience significant growth in Japan -- the country has only six unicorns, that is, unlisted startups valued at over 1 billion U.S. dollars. By comparison, there are 488 In addition to talent and a customer base, funding is essential to promote the growth of startups. Yet the volume of venture capital investment in startups in Japan remains tiny To address this situation, the government has announced plans to lay the groundwork for the creation and growth of startups, such as streamlining the initial public offering (IPO) process and exploring a framework for special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) from the perspective of investor protection. I expect such efforts, coupled with an inflow of venture capital, to support startup growth. At the same time, I look for more active M&A activities to help integrate ventures with their best owners, and for entrepreneurs to keep trying to start new businesses and drive growth. My strong hope is that these developments will revive the dynamism of Japanese firms and generate a wealth of innovation, thereby allowing Japan to soon realize new growth. Another key to innovation, alongside corporate dynamism, is human capital. Under Japan's long-term employment practices, marked by seniority-based wages and internal promotions, both management and employees prioritized achieving greater production efficiency, and there was a strong tendency for them to emphasize gaining experience through business activities and on-the-job training. In an era where boosting the efficiency of existing business operations was the driving force behind growth, I think that In the current VUCA era, however, it is no longer possible to achieve sustainable growth simply by boosting the efficiency of existing business operations. Also, on-the-job training alone, being an extension of existing business operations, is not adequate to the discontinuous nature of innovation. Investment in human capital is vital for acquiring new ideas and capabilities. Such investment has been muted in Japan, however, being typically treated as a ""cost"" in corporate accounting. We see the difference, for example, in the ratio of Japanese firms' vocational training costs to GDP, which is low relative to other advanced economies (Chart 16). Meanwhile, the average amount of money spent by firms per employee on off- the-job training and self-development support is also on the wane (Chart 17). To encourage firms to invest in human capital, Japan's Prime Minister announced in a policy speech in January that the government would formulate rules for corporate disclosure of non- financial information, including investment in human capital, within the year. Until now, it has been difficult to link HR strategies to management strategies because there have been no benchmarks for comparison with other firms, and management has not been equipped to set key performance indicators (KPIs). By making human capital investment more transparent, the new government measure is expected to make it easier for management to set concrete targets and formulate strategies to realize them. Furthermore, the measure has the potential to accelerate corporate growth, as both investors and employees can use the information to evaluate firms in terms of growth potential, among other factors. As such efforts gain momentum, I think that they will lead to sustainable economic growth and accelerate the shift to an era in which employees are better equipped to choose which firm they wish to work for. Regarding distribution, average income per household decreased from 6.17 million yen in 2000 to 5.52 million yen in 2018, but this includes the effect of population aging (Chart 18). Looking at households other than the elderly, while average income fell from 6.78 million yen in 2000 to 6.10 million yen in 2012, it subsequently rose to 6.59 million yen in 2018, prior to the outbreak of COVID-19. To bring prosperity to Japan's super-aging society as a whole, it will be crucial to further raise the income level of workers. One of the unintended consequences of structural labor shortages is that employees will have greater power to choose which firm they wish to work for. Consequently, managers are expected to implement growth strategies that enhance the appeal and growth potential of their firms and adopt more dynamic HR policies, including greater investment in human capital to foster employee development, higher compensation levels, the use of stock options, and putting in place more robust pension plans. Individuals, too, will be expected to enhance their skills to increase their added value. They will need to expand their sources of stable income and build a post-retirement nest egg by investing in financial assets focusing on the long term, on diversification, and on regular contributions. Household financial assets in Japan amounted to approximately 2,000 trillion yen as of the end of September 2021. However, cash and deposits accounted for by far the highest proportion of the total, at 54 percent, with stocks and investment trusts representing a mere 15 percent. The situation in the United States is quite the opposite, with cash and deposits accounting for 13 percent and stocks and investment trusts 51 percent of household financial assets as of end-March 2021. The deep-rooted tendency of Japanese households to hold their assets in cash and deposits is likely shaped by the trauma of the collapse of the bubble economy and the experience of the long-term economic stagnation that followed. Experience has made older people in particular tend to believe that the stock price of Japanese firms is linked to Japan's GDP. However, people in their 20s and 30s have had virtually no experience of such trauma, and they understand that, with the globalization of Japanese firms, stock prices rise in line with growth in the global economy. In fact, with the institutional support now available, such as the interest in investment trusts, especially among young people. If households can reap the fruits of global economic growth by gaining stable income through the dividends from their investment in financial assets focusing on the long term, on diversification, and on regular contributions, I think that this will help bring about a virtuous cycle of growth and distribution. Moreover, buoyed by the Bank's persistent monetary easing, I believe that active innovation by firms and by individuals will increase the potential growth rate of Japan's economy and bring the country closer to achieving the Bank's 2 percent price stability target.

4056,r980422a_SRB,sweden,1998-04-22,Swedish monetary policy outside EMU,backstrom,1,"Riksbank, of arranging the Monetary Policy Forum. This is our sixth annual opportunity of discussing monetary policy issues in the Forum and what could be more natural on this occasion than to consider the monetary policy future in Europe in connection with the launching of what is perhaps history's most momentous project in this field. Besides the question of how monetary policy will be conducted in the euro area, an equally important issue for us in Sweden is how our monetary policy will be affected when Stage Three of EMU starts and Sweden does not participate initially. The discussion of ""Monetary Policy in EMU"" is to be opened by my Finnish colleague, Dr. Sirkka Hamalainen, and I want to take this opportunity of wishing her heartily welcome to Sweden. In this context I should also like to express my appreciation of the close cooperation between Suomen Pankki and Sveriges Riksbank, which we reckon to continue even though Finland participates in the monetary union. paint my picture of what an outsider position will entail for Sweden's economic policy. Then I will look at how monetary policy in Sweden is constructed in principle and conclude with some remarks on the current situation. In that Sweden will be outside the euro area initially, our economic policy will be constructed to fulfil the goals that are set up in Sweden. These goals are based in turn on our domestic priorities together with the commitments we have as a member of the European Union. To a large extent, Sweden's priorities are the same as the EU's: implement an economic policy constructed for stability and low inflation, thereby creating conditions for a good development of prosperity. Participation or otherwise in the monetary union does not affect the need for a balanced economic policy. A political majority has stated that membership of the European exchange rate mechanism, ERM, is to be seen as a preliminary step towards participation in the monetary union. Thus there are reasons for supposing that the question of ERM membership will not be topical until the issue of future EMU participation has been resolved. Meanwhile, the Riksbank will continue to operate with a flexible exchange rate regime and an explicit price stability target for monetary policy. Here it should be underscored that experience to date indicates that this regime is working well. From the beginning of 1999 the Riksbank's present independent position will be formally embedded in law. The price stability objective will have statutory force and the function of the Riksbank will be to ensure that this objective is fulfilled. The amendments to the legislation on the Riksbank have already been approved once by the Riksdag (Sweden's Parliament) and a second vote on this constitutional change is scheduled for after the general election in September. The reform is supported by five of the political parties and thus by a clear parliamentary majority. These changes meet EU requirements concerning monetary policy and the role of the central bank. Whether or not we adopt the single currency, Sweden has undertaken to have an independent central bank and this entails a far-reaching delegation of monetary policy decisions on the basis of an operational objective. Similarly, Swedish fiscal policy will continue to be based both on our national objectives and on the requirements that have been adopted for the European An objective for Sweden's public finances has been set up by the Government and approved by the Riksdag. In the medium term the government budget is to show a surplus, measured as the cyclical average, of 2 per cent of GDP. In that a surplus is generated, government debt can be reduced so that future challenges which Sweden's economy may face can be tackled without creating problems for government finances. Considering the government debt that has accumulated in the 1990s and the fact that Sweden's public finances are relatively sensitive to cyclical activity, this objective is reasonable. Current assessments, based on existing decisions and official economic policy, suggest that the budget policy target will be met in the coming years. Besides the greater awareness of the importance of stable finances, the conditions for fulfilling the budget objective have been improved by institutional changes to the budget process. Sweden's new budget process is inherently more disciplined than before and this can contribute to the maintenance of sound finances. The Swedish objective of government financial consolidation is in line with the EU budgetary aim of positions close to balance or in surplus over the medium term. So Sweden's fiscal policy is also subject to EU agreements even though we have deferred participation in the monetary union. Sweden has undertaken to aim for the objectives in the Stability and Growth Pact. More generally, as a member state, Sweden has undertaken to regard its economic policy as a matter of common concern to all EU member states. We will accordingly be participating in the economic policy discussions and be subjected to assessments and evaluations. We are also taking part in the drafting of the broad guidelines of economic policies; these guidelines, which can be likened to fiscal plans for the Community, are to be incorporated in the construction of EU countries' economic policies. A broad consensus has been established--in the world in general as well as in Sweden--about the objectives and institutional arrangements that are appropriate for economic policy, as well as the importance of international economic cooperation. The inflation economy that prevailed earlier caused major problems. An expansionary economic policy with subsequent devaluations does not generate any lasting positive effects in the real economy. It is liable to result in high inflation that erodes the short-run gains in terms of costs. The longer the period of inflation, moreover, the more painful will be the readjustment to a more sustainable economic development based on low inflation. Developments in Sweden have been moving in the right direction for a number of years. Inflation is low and growth favourable. Earlier imbalances, in the government budget as well as in foreign transactions, have been turned into surpluses. Whether the adjustments in the labour market are sufficient to permit a sustained and more extensive increase in employment in the coming years remains to be seen. Sweden is in its sixth year with a flexible exchange rate regime and the fourth year with a specific price stability target. Insights into the new regime have been gained step by step, both in the Riksbank and in the Swedish community in general. The construction of the regime and its underlying ideas have been discussed over these years, not least in these Monetary Policy Forums. The present monetary policy regime provides good conditions for long-term price stability and thereby for an economy that functions better. It also contributes to an appropriate short-run balance between acting as a clear anchor for price stability and promoting real economic stabilisation. Basically, it is a matter of minimising both the fluctuations around the price stability target and those around the Swedish economy's growth trend. Cyclical fluctuations cannot be eliminated but we can hope that sequences of intense boom-and-bust are a thing of the past. When inflation converges internationally and long-term inflation expectations are permanently lowered to the level of the target for price stability, the core of the inflation process lies in the relationship between prevailing demand and the sustainable level of output. If resource utilisation is so high that it becomes strained, inflation will tend to rise. Conversely, when resource utilisation is low, inflation tends to fall. To a large extent it is the interaction of demand and supply that determines whether inflation is rising, falling or constant in relation to the 2 per cent target. Monetary policy is capable of exerting a direct effect--through the repo rate-- on only one of these two sides of the economy, namely demand. The supply side is essentially influenced by structural factors that the Riksbank cannot control directly. But permanently high inflation can indirectly impair the workings of the economy, leading to weaker growth. By the same token, today's low inflation should help the supply side to function more efficiently. Seen from this angle, it is easy to appreciate that a policy for safeguarding price stability should be able to go hand in hand with a development of demand that matches the supply side's sustainable capacity. In the event of a demand shock, even in the short run the Riksbank's objective therefore coincides with that of general economic policy--a favourable real economic trend. In view of the discussion that arises from time to time about objectives for the Riksbank, this should be born in mind. Consider these two examples: Suppose, first, that a shock causes demand to fall; resource utilisation will then decline, with a risk of inflation dropping below the 2 per cent target. The monetary stance must then be adjusted so that the rate of inflation returns to the target. This involves lowering the repo rate so that demand recovers. Suppose, instead, that a shock causes demand to rise faster than the supply side can cope with. Inflation will then be liable to rise above the targeted rate. The monetary stance must therefore be tightened so that inflation falls back to the target, which involves subduing demand to output's sustainable level. In the various situations, the impact of monetary policy can be contractive, expansive or neutral, depending on the degree of resource utilisation and the risk of inflation deviating from the target in either direction. The relevant rate of inflation here and the one that is affected by total demand, is the underlying trend. In that this trend is in line with the target, conditions are created for sustainable growth. In the event of a demand shock there is thus no conflict between combating inflation and promoting growth. Besides effects from demand shocks, price movements are influenced by disturbances in supply. Supply-side shocks vary both in kind and in the duration of their effects on the economy. The monetary policy response accordingly depends on how suddenly such a shock occurs and how soon it fades. A supply shock with a direct effect on prices, for example a VAT increase, should be distinguished from an increase in productivity, which affects demand via resource utilisation. Let me start with the former case. A VAT increase will tend to subdue demand at the same time as it adds to the 12month rate of CPI inflation over a period of one year. In this case, in the first year after the tax increase, demand and inflation move in opposite directions. If the monetary stance were to be tightened in order to achieve a prompt return to inflation's targeted rate, it would cause demand to fall further. Temporary price stabilisation would be accompanied by a destablisation of real economic activity. A similar dilemma is posed by VAT reduction, which stimulates the economy and lowers registered inflation. A monetary policy response in the form of a repo rate cut--to return inflation to the target--would act as a further economic stimulus. Here, too, temporary price stabilisation would be accompanied by a destablisation of real economic activity. I have used VAT adjustments here as an example of shocks from the supply side. Effects of the same type are associated with changes in other indirect taxes, for instance the current proposal to lower the tax on tobacco. The same applies to international oil price movements, as well as to the Riksbank's own interest rate adjustments, which have a direct impact on house mortgage interest costs. How, then, should monetary policy deal with a situation in which prices are exposed to supply shocks of this kind? Part of the answer lies in the circumstance that--provided people's medium- or long-term inflation expectations remain unaffected--most shocks of this type are transitory. The Riksbank has concluded that in the normal course of events, transitory price effects of this type ought to be a secondary consideration in the construction of monetary policy in so far as they do not affect inflation expectations and thereby have a more permanent impact on inflation. Effects of supply-side shocks may, however, be more permanent. An improvement in trend productivity, for example, implies lower resource utilisation and thereby lower underlying inflation, and vice versa. Such supply shocks should therefore influence the construction of monetary policy. A drawback with the CPI is that it combines information about both the underlying trend and temporary price movements. So why has the Riksbank chosen the CPI as its target variable instead of some indicator of underlying inflation? The reason lies in the CPI's advantages as a familiar index that is used in many contexts, whereas the opposite applies to the concept of underlying inflation. Statistics Sweden could, in fact, supplement the CPI figures with a series on underlying inflation that would ultimately become more familiar. This is a matter that the CPI Enquiry will be considering. But it is still not clear just how an index of underlying inflation should be constructed. What is clear, however, is that this function cannot be performed by the Net Price Index because that excludes only one type of transitory effect, namely indirect taxes. In that it includes other transitory effects--for example mortgage interest costs and international oil price movements--the Net Price Index gives a picture of inflation's underlying trend that is incomplete and distorted. Another alternative would be to use the EU's harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP), which is constructed to exclude house mortgage interest costs. One disadvantage of this index, however, is that some of its components have not yet been finalised. As an aid in the analysis of price trends, the Riksbank's inflation reports include various indicators of underlying inflation. The tolerance interval of +-1 percentage point serves, among other things, to accommodate the various transitory price movements that normally occur. Experience has shown, however, that in periods when the transitory price effects are extensive, inflation may move outside the interval without this by itself having consequences that should be considered in monetary policy. Thus, the tolerance interval represents the range that is normally expected for fluctuations in CPI inflation. It serves to indicate that the target variable, the CPI, cannot be controlled exactly. Still, I am convinced that people's awareness and understanding of these factors will gradually grow as time passes. This will happen not least as a result of the efforts of all those knowledgeable analysts and business journalists who follow monetary policy closely and mostly do their utmost to explain these complex details to a broader public. Now I should like to say something about the role of the exchange rate. Our monetary policy strategy is premised on a flexible exchange rate. In other words, the Riksbank does not explicitly target the exchange rate and, given Sweden's position on ERM, it seems today that the rate will continue to be flexible at least until a new political decision is taken on the issue of EMU. This complies with EU agreements. ERM membership is voluntary. But even in a flexible regime, exchange rate movements constitute an important policy indicator, albeit more indirectly . If the exchange rate weakens and remains at the weaker level, demand in the Swedish economy is stimulated via increased exports and decreased imports. In this way, a permanent depreciation can lead to higher inflationary pressure. The Riksbank then has to keep its instrumental rate at a higher level than otherwise in order to fulfil the price stability target. A permanent appreciation of the krona tends to dampen demand, leading to lower inflationary pressure. All else equal, the Riksbank can then keep the instrumental rate at a lower level. With reference to the exchange rate, the Riksbank is wont to talk of or developments and that is applicable here. We do not react to occasional market movements because they are unlikely to influence inflation prospects. The Maastricht Treaty requires all member states to treat exchange rate policy as a matter of common interest; this applies even if the exchange rate is flexible. An EU country is expected to focus economic policy--both monetary and budget policy--on stability to the same degree as the other EU countries. This, basically, is the absolutely crucial condition for sustained exchange rate stability. An exchange rate that deviates permanently from the long-term real equilibrium level may be an indication that economic policy lacks credibility. In such a situation the EU member states have a ""common interest"" in discussing how confidence in economic policy can be enhanced. During the spring there has been a discussion in Sweden about the exchange rate tendency in connection with the move to Stage Three of EMU. What will happen if, for instance, companies adopt the euro as their unit of account? The Riksbank has underscored that it does not see any strong reasons for large currency outflows on account of the monetary union. And if such outflows were to occur and the krona suddenly weakened, we consider that countervailing forces would act in financial markets. The value of a currency is determined by numerous factors, of which the most important is confidence in the country's economic policy. The general trend towards internationalisation in recent years has entailed relatively large currency outflows due to portfolio diversification among resident investors. But at the same time the krona has displayed an appreciating trend as growing confidence in economic policy generated a compensatory currency inflow. All in all, conditions for a stable exchange rate between the krona and the single currency should be good. There are many indications that the European Central Bank will define a price stability target that resembles Sweden's. Similar inflation trends, together with confidence in economic policy as a whole, should result not only in stable nominal and real exchange rates between the euro and the krona but also in conditions for a reasonable valuation of the krona. When assessing monetary policy's construction, we look ahead to assess the path of inflation in the coming twelve to twenty-four months. A relatively long target horizon does have the drawback that earlier assessments may have to be revised. One reason for choosing a long horizon--with the attendant difficulties in making reliable forecasts--is the time lag before effects of monetary policy materialise. By acting in good time, it is possible to adjust interest policy more gradually and smoothly. In this way, any consequences that altered inflation prospects may have for the monetary stance will usually be gradual and small. With a shorter target horizon, the inflation assessments might be more accurate but the monetary policy responses would have to be more pronounced in order to fulfil the target. There would also be wider fluctuations in output and employment. Real factors like production and employment are accordingly taken into account when making this choice. In view of the difficulties in assessing and forecasting economic tendencies and monetary policy effects exactly, the Riksbank has opted for one to two years as its normal target horizon. The forecasting problem can be illustrated with assessments from the National Institute of Economic Research; I use them here simply as an example, not to single out the National Institute from other forecasters. But the National Institute is one of the forecasters with the largest resources and it usually ""sets the trend"" for other forecasters. Last November the Institute counted on annual rates of CPI inflation of 2.0 per cent for 1998 and 2.5 per cent for 1999. In other words, inflation would move gradually upwards from the price stability target. In keeping with this, the Institute also counted on an monetary policy realignment, with an expected increase in the repo rate from 4.10 to 5.5 per cent, that is, by 140 basis points. This March--only four months later--the National Institute's prediction of inflation had changed considerably, to annual rates of 1.1 and 1.5 per cent for 1998 and 1999, respectively. The Institute's most recent assessment is that during 1998 and 1999 there is no need for any change from the present level of the repo rate. What has happened to forecasters' perception of inflation? Basically, nothing has happened in the appraisal of the upward cyclical phase. The National Institute, like most other observers, counts on good growth in the coming years. The strength of the upswing may vary but the overall picture is that demand growth will be somewhat above the long-term trend, which implies rising resource utilisation. But besides expectations of lower wage increases, there have been a number of favourable price shocks on the supply side. Falling international crude oil prices have already led to price reductions for energy-related goods. Moreover, falling interest rates have lowered house mortgage interest costs. Then there is the Government's proposed reduction of tobacco tax. However, the price shocks from the supply side are mainly transitory and tend to lower the CPI temporarily but not necessarily inflation's underlying trend. It follows that these effects probably should not have much influence on monetary policy. This holds even though the CPI change figures are likely to move outside the lower tolerance limit for a time during 1998, mainly on account of the lower tobacco tax. As I mentioned earlier, the primary concern for monetary policy is inflation's underlying rate and trend. In that the monetary conditions have been expansionary for some time and both economic activity and resource utilisation are rising, Sweden should be moving towards a situation with some increase in underlying inflation. This phase may not be imminent or involve anything dramatic but rising resource utilisation will ultimately lead to it. But there are some factors which may defer it. They have to do with the momentum in the Swedish economy and the impact that may come from the crisis in Asia. Another central factor is the exchange rate's underlying trend. In addition there is the increasingly discussed uncertainty about the sustainability of international share prices. To sum up, most of the evidence suggests that economic growth in Sweden will become stronger in the coming two years. To date, however, the upswing has been accompanied by subdued price movements. This mainly reflects a number of favourable transitory effects but there may also be signs of a somewhat lower inflation propensity. The strength displayed by productivity may perhaps enable the Swedish economy to expand somewhat faster without immediately generating inflationary pressure. But it is still too early to form a more definite opinion on whether the productivity trend has changed. It is now important that incoming statistics are still followed closely and assessed. As I just said, there is no reason at present to alter the repo rate.","['sweden', 'riksbank', 'euro', 'currency', 'finland']","['sweden monetary', 'currency sweden', 'policy sweden', 'riksbank swedish', 'sweden economy']","['sweden monetary policy', 'monetary policy sweden', 'monetary union sweden', 'issue sweden monetary', 'currency sweden undertaken']"
4101,r991014a_SRB,sweden,1999-10-14,The euro and Swedish housing finance,nyberg,0,"Thank you for giving me the opportunity to come here and give some points of view on how EMU may affect the Swedish housing loan market and its financing. This is undeniably an issue which we have every reason to take an interest in whether we take part in the monetary union or not. One of the ideas with EMU is to create a more efficient market for goods and services where competition is increasing and consumers obtain better products at lower prices. In the housing loan market, this should mean that borrowers expect a greater range of products, more suppliers and lower interest rates. How should the Swedish housing loan institutions handle this challenge? Competition for customers As we know, the national housing loan markets in Europe look rather different, which is illustrated by the following diagram (figure 1). In countries such as outstanding stock of loans with mortgages in property totalled over 50 per cent of GDP. In other countries, including Greece and Italy, the equivalent figure is under 10 per cent. The differences depend on factors such as the systems of rules, tax legislation and market structure which vary from country to country. Housing finance has, as in Sweden, often been an issue of great political interest, which is reflected in all the above factors. It might be thought that standardised financial products such as housing loans should be very suitable for cross-border sales, but cross-border activity has been little to date. This is probably related to the housing loan market being primarily focused on private customers, who are difficult to reach without a local distribution network. It remains to be seen what internet can change in that respect. However, why should people not purchase a housing loan on the net, when they now pay bills and carry out other transactions that way. There are already today good possibilities for finding the cheapest housing loan on the market via internet, so technology will certainly increase transparency and competition even within the traditional more inert private sector. We are far from the time when Swedish house owners waited respectfully for years to move their building credit at the bank to a real five-year loan at a housing loan institution. Those wishing to sell housing loans on the Swedish market must, however, accept offering loans in kronor for the time being if they are to meet anything other than sporadic interest. This restricts competition to those who really actively want to sell their products in Sweden. If we enter EMU, it will be a different matter. We can then borrow in euro without being exposed to an exchange risk and access to potential lenders will increase dramatically. Mainly as a result of the deregulations in the 1980s and 1990s and the ensuing increasing competition, the Swedish housing loan sector has been condensed to five companies, of which four are subsidiaries of banks and the fifth is state-owned. These five companies cover around 95 per cent of the market (figure 2). As housing loans are very standardised products, it is natural that the price, i.e. the interest rate, will be a crucial factor in competition for customers. This means in turn that refinancing costs will be absolutely decisive for running a profitable business. In the light of this, there is every reason to discuss what EMU and the euro can mean for the future financing opportunities and how Swedish businesses stand up Traditional housing loan finance - a good alternative The Swedish mortgage institutions have traditionally been financed with collateral in their entire balance sheet. There is thus no direct link between a particular loan and the collateral belonging to it on the one hand and certain issued bond loans on the other. In many countries, mortgage companies are obliged to collect a number of housing loans and then issue bond loans in the market with these as collateral. There are different techniques for this to which I will return later. The Swedish model thus has advantages to the extent that borrowing can take place without a fixed link to lending. In this way, large loans can be placed in the market, which will make it easier to maintain regular trade and a good liquidity in the loans. This has occurred with the so-called benchmark bonds. However, housing loan institutions, among other things due to considerable loan volumes and a good price formation for domestic loans have also been able to successfully compete in the international bond market. If one is to borrow on the balance sheet, it must naturally be in such a state as to be accepted by the lenders. The Swedish institutions have managed this by strict operating rules, which place limits on what the institutions may engage in and allow lenders to ensure that the institutions get involved in what they have said they are going to do and nothing else. However, a not inconsiderable risk capital or guarantees from the owners have also been required. Capital adequacy in the Swedish companies is shown in figure 3. If - or rather when - the owners' requirements for return on the capital contributed increase this can be problem. During the financial crisis in Sweden, the balance sheets were for obvious reasons insufficient to enable the institutions to borrow at competitive prices in the international market. This uncertainty on asset values was all too great for a period. Since then, however, creditworthiness has been continually increased, which is reflected in a gradually improved international rating. The Swedish housing loan institutions have today around 13 per cent of their borrowing abroad. Traditionally the Swedish insurance companies and pension boards have been large purchasers of housing institution bonds. A part of the international borrowing has taken place in Europe, in particular in London, while the major part has originated from investors in the USA and Japan. An interesting issue is whether the ability to borrow in euro will make the Central European investors more interested in Swedish risks than before? It remains to be seen. However, obtaining capital in the international market is a laborious and long-term work that requires a systematic build-up of confidence. Every new lender must become acquainted with the borrower's name and history and eventually request a limit in his board. This takes time and the process is not simplified by a common currency. With regard to building up the international investment base, the Swedish housing credit institutions have perhaps had slightly different approaches and priorities. Having a well-established network of contacts among the European investors is surely not a bad idea the day that the euro becomes our own currency. It is interesting to note the rapid increase in Swedish corporate bonds issued in euro during the autumn. The supply of government bonds has decreased which has led investors to look for other alternatives, but they have clearly become increasingly interested in assuming additional risk in exchange for some additional interest rate percentage points in the return. Eriksson, Volvo and now most recently Birka Energi are making company presentations at places in Europe where few investors have previously shown interest. And Birka can hardly be said to be a familiar name in the market outside Sweden. This development should also include opportunities for the housing loan institutions. Gilt-edged bonds If it is wished to see how EMU can affect housing finance, it is close to hand to study conditions in Germany since these, together with the Danish model of housing finance will be given special treatment in the EC directives in the area. In Germany housing loans are traditionally financed via so-called Pfandbriefen, which are essentially housing bonds with a clearly specified body of collateral. As has been pointed out, the Swedish housing companies finance the whole of their balance sheets without linking particular collateral to each loan issued. With regard to pfandbriefen, legal regulation moreover plays an important role for the nature of collateral and checks on the parts of the authorities. The Government has had a committee of inquiry investigate how the so-called ""giltedged bonds"" could be designed in Sweden and the legislation and supervision that should be required. In brief, this proposal means that the right of priority would apply to this type of bonds, that clear limits would be introduced for the extent of borrowing against them (at most 75 per cent for housing properties) and that collateral would be identified in a special register controlled by Finansinspektionen. The Ministry of Finance is at present considering its standpoint on these proposals. When the discussion on gilt-edged bonds was initiated in Sweden at the beginning of the 90s, the background was concern that the new investment rules planned for the insurance companies would make it more difficult for the housing institutions to obtain finance. The requirements for diversification of assets would introduce stringent restrictions on the ability of the insurance companies to hold housing bonds. Representatives of the industry claimed that considerable volumes of housing bonds would be sold by the insurance companies for this reason and that this would affect the market and increase costs for borrowers sharply. The giltedged bonds could at least partly solve the problem since, according to the EC directive, they would not be affected so much by the rules for single-party commitment. Others were doubtful about introducing special rules for insurance companies to give them an incentive to have a larger proportion of housing bonds in their portfolios than they would normally choose. There are no good arguments for letting insurance policyholders subsidise either housing loan institutions or their customers. Now the new investment rules were introduced for the insurance companies without this leading to any of the terrible consequences that had been predicted. The housing loan institutions began to borrow abroad to an increasing extent, which was a good idea from many respects. Hopefully, then the desire to create space for a larger proportion of housing bonds in the Swedish insurance companies' portfolios will then no longer serve as a motivation for the gilt-edged bonds. As long as the insurance companies had their undertakings in kronor, some concentration of investments was explicable. However, the day that Sweden becomes a member EMU and we have the euro as currency, the portfolios of the insurance companies will appear rather remarkable if a predominant part of the risks in interest-bearing securities is in five housing loan institutions. Even if housing bonds are as gilt-edged as possible, the insurance companies in this situation will feel a need of increased diversification. The main argument for enabling the Swedish housing companies to issue giltedged bonds is naturally that competitors in Europe issue them and they are established in the market. They would be easier to sell to investors, carry a higher liquidity and provide lower interest rates than traditional Swedish housing bonds. This would facilitate financing and hopefully give the consumers lower interest rates. There is undoubtedly something in this line of reasoning. However, the Riksbank has taken a critical attitude to this proposal more for reasons of principle. The housing institutions have every opportunity themselves - via clauses in the bond contracts or even in articles of association - to create the collateral arrangements that they consider appropriate and thus give their bonds the gilt edge that they consider necessary to facilitate financing. If the state assumes the responsibility of legislating about the design of bonds and moreover to check compliance by institutions, this is a regulation that cannot be motivated by concern for the stability of the financial system but rather aims at improving the institution's profitability by reducing financing costs. Such regulations are usually called into question by both the industry and the legislative authorities. There is undeniably something to be said for their view of this matter as well. It is moreover easy to create the impression that the state by its control takes a special responsibility for the collateral in the bonds, which is not the intention. Perhaps one should also ask whether a gilt edge to the bonds would really give the effects hoped for. The large liquid securities with the best creditworthiness (AAArated) in the European mortgage market (Offentliche Pfandbriefen) have in the first place collateral in loans to local governments or federal states and not in the market that the Swedish housing companies can use. They would rather issue ""Hypotheken Pfandbriefe"" with collateral in office premises and housing and both interest and liquidity are less favourable in the market. It does not seem either as if any uniform market for mortgages is in process of being established, but the regulatory framework differs considerably from country to country. Investors will hardly avoid making separate appraisals for each of these markets. Moreover, it seems not wholly unexpectedly as if EMU would affect developments in the direction from relatively rule-governed national markets such as the Danish and German to internationally open markets, where new instruments can be developed in a flexible way as the need arises. In the light of this, one cannot avoid wondering whether it is wise and really in the market's interest to lock certain instruments into a separate legislation, which can be difficult to change once in place. If EMU really leads to the European market for borrowed capital being improved, which we all believe and hope, developments may move in a completely different direction. We shall have to see what the future holds in store. The existing Swedish form for housing finance is, as pointed out, not necessarily a bad financing form in a developed European market with a uniform currency. On the contrary. The Swedish housing loan institutions are known and respected in the market, have large outstanding volumes that provide a basis for good liquidity and a transparent price formation and can moreover benefit from a rating that is improving as Sweden's does. The great challenge from EMU is rather on a different level. When competition gradually increases, not only on the corporate side but also in the market for apartment blocks, tenant-owned apartments and houses, this will probably eventually reduce profit margins. The return on equity will then also fall. An issue that naturally arises is whether it is possible to find housing forms that make more economical use of equity provided by the owners. In my opinion, it is in this perspective that the discussion on securitisation is to be viewed. Securutisation means that a given loan stock with the collateral pertaining to it is lifted out of the balance sheet in the housing loan institution and invested in a company separately created for the purpose (a so-called special purpose vehicle), which is then financed in the market by issuing bonds. This company has a clearly defined risk scenario and does not carry out any activity besides holding the specified loans. It need not therefore be subject to the capital adequacy rules that apply for housing loan institutions. Assume that the housing loan institution must set aside four million kronor of a loan stock of 100 million while the market accepts financing the securitised stock with a capital of 1 million kronor in the company created for the purpose. If the stock provides a return of SEK 400,000 after financing and operating expenses, this gives a return on capital in the housing loan institution of ten per cent before tax. The same loan invested in the special company will provide a return on capital of forty per cent before tax. A buffer for investors can also be added on via credit guarantees, which further reduce the requirement of equity. A number of objections can be raised to this example, but it serves well to illustrate the driving mechanism behind a securitisation. In practice there are many difficulties. One such is naturally that it is not possible to build special purpose companies in Sweden without their being subject to the Act on Financing Operations and thus being affected by the same capital adequacy rules as the housing loan institutions. In a ministerial memorandum from 1998 dealing with better prerequisites for securitisation, a change is proposed inter alia in this respect. Such a change is also proposed in the banking legislation committee's report from last spring. The Ministry of Finance is at present considering these proposals as well as gilt-edged bonds. It is planned to introduce proposed legislation early next year. Now there are also other objections to securitisation. It has to date been relatively complicated and therefore expensive to create special purpose vehicles and it has not been possible to invest their bonds with such good interest rates as their rating should occasion. to. One reason for this may be that the market is undeveloped, and that issues have been few and small in this context and that liquidity in the bonds has consequently been low. Another cause may be found in the regulatory framework, since securitised bonds in banks and other financial institutions, which are expected to create a market for bonds, are affected by higher capital adequacy requirements than ordinary housing bonds. In the USA, as known, securitisation of housing loans is a common occurrence, which is partly due to institutional reasons. In Europe, housing finance has mainly taken other forms. If now EMU leads to increased competition in the housing loan market, which should be an effect of monetary union, there will also be an expanded need to finance housing loans in way that is economical with capital. It is not unreasonable to believe that securitisation in this perspective will attract increasing interest. Increased competition can accordingly drive forward a growing market for securitisation. However, the causal connection can also be the opposite, namely that improved opportunities for securitisation will increase competition. This is the experience in Australia, where the housing loan market was deregulated in the 1990s. A legislation that facilitates securitisation reduced the previously high entry barriers which existed in the market, cleared the way for new players and reduced costs for the housing loan customers - in fact by as much as a couple of percentage points. Some conclusions Taken as a whole, we seem to be moving towards greater competition in the housing finance sector. New financing forms, new technology and possible EMU membership are driving factors that will together reduce entry barriers and thus increase competition. Since housing loans are standardised products, it is above all price which is the means of competition. The financing issues will thus be at the centre of interest. The traditional Swedish form for housing finance where the entire balance sheet constitutes one body of collateral has many advantages. It is possible that the investors' demands for collateral in the form of equity may gradually make this form too expensive. A more developed market for securitisation may be one way of tackling this problem. It requires, however, assistance from the authorities in the form of a simplified regulatory framework. A well-developed market for gilt-edged bonds may also work in the same direction, but this also requires the approval of the authorities. A general reflection is that the financial innovations in a new market develop best if they are controlled by the wishes of investors and issuers. It is impossible to say what these wishes will be like in future. The role of authorities is to create a body of rules that provides scope for changes and preferably avoids locking the market into special structures or instruments. The Swedish housing loan institutions are well run and should have good opportunities for borrowing competitively in the European market however it develops. However, no one can borrow without systematically building up relations with the funds, insurance companies and other institutional investors which make up the so-called investor base. All the Swedish institutions have a task here in the market for euro.","['lenders', 'lending', 'loan', 'financing', 'loans']","['lenders swedish', 'swedish housing', 'loans swedish', 'finance sweden', 'swedish market']","['loans swedish market', 'competition swedish housing', 'market swedish housing', 'housing loans swedish', 'lenders swedish institutions']"
4354,r070313a_SRB,sweden,2007-03-13,Credit derivatives - risks and opportunities,nyberg,0,"Let me begin by thanking you for the invitation to come here and speak about the risks and opportunities offered by credit derivatives. Credit derivatives may appear complicated, but the principles as to how they work are essentially simple. They are a type of insurance, nothing else. A person who owns a house runs the risk that the house may burn down. A person lending money runs the risk that the borrower will not pay back the loan. The house-owner usually wants to sign a home insurance policy covering the risk of fire and is happy to pay a premium for this. The bank lending money may correspondingly - although banks are actually specialised in managing credit risk - wish to sign a credit insurance to dispose of the credit risk, wholly or partly. The bank then also has to pay an insurance premium. A credit derivative is quite simply a modern form of credit insurance, adapted for trade in the financial markets. Trade in credit derivatives has expanded enormously in recent years, which of course implies that credit derivatives offer advantages to their users. At the same time, a debate on the potential risks for the financial system has arisen and interest from the supervisory authorities and central banks has increased. If the credit risks disappear from the banks, where do they go? Today I intend to speak a little bit about the risks involved in credit derivatives, which so far mainly concern the international market. Here in Sweden the use of credit derivatives is still limited, although increasing. Then I intend to mention the opportunities I see in Sweden. But let me first run through how credit derivatives are used and how the market has developed in recent years. A credit derivative is a financial contract between two parties. It insures the buyer of the contract against the credit suffering a credit event during a predetermined period. The credit event quite simply defines what the insurance covers, in roughly the same way as the conditions in a normal home insurance. I shall return to this shortly. Take, for instance, a company like TeliaSonera. Then imagine a bank that has loaned money to this company. This may involve a lot of money as TeliaSonera is a large company. Although Telia's ability to pay is good when the loan is taken, the bank is exposed to the risk that it may deteriorate in the long term. If the bank considers the credit risk to be too high, it may choose to ""sell"" part of it to another investor. Then the bank can use the credit derivatives market. For the bank, which in this case is the seller of credit risk, the credit derivative functions roughly like a normal insurance. The buyer of the credit risk (the insurance provider) commits itself to compensating the bank if TeliaSonera does not fulfil its obligations in some way during the contract period. The bank pays a regular premium for this, which is determined when the contract is signed. The definition of failing to fulfil its obligations is made clear in the contract between the bank and the investor. This is what is known in the jargon as a credit event. It could mean, for instance, that TeliaSonera doesn't pay the interest as agreed, that it defaults on payment of the outstanding debt or that it goes bankrupt. The premium the bank has to pay to the investor reflects the market's assessment of the risk that such an event will occur. The greater the probability, the higher the premium. Most companies for which credit derivatives are traded also have bond loans issued on the international market for corporate bonds. How much an investor is willing to pay for these bonds depends of course on how he assesses the probability that the company will default on its interest payments or perhaps even go bankrupt - that is to say, that a credit event will occur. The premium that is to cover the risk of a credit event corresponds to the premium the corporate bond commands over a government bond without credit risk. The prices of the credit derivatives are therefore strongly related to the prices of the bonds issued by the company. In actual fact, the market for credit derivatives is often more liquid than the market for the underlying bonds. In this case the prices of the company risks are determined in the credit derivatives market rather than the market for the underlying corporate bonds. The most common credit derivatives are called Credit Default Swaps, abbreviated as CDS. A swap is usually an exchange of payment flows and one might wonder what is being exchanged in this case. It concerns what happens if the insurance needs to be used, that is, if a credit event occurs. Then the bank (the insurance policy owner) would have to sell a bond corresponding to the credit amount to the insurer at a nominal value. This is despite the fact that the bond has become worth much less or even worthless as a result of the credit event. The bank thus swaps the bond for a cash payment. This is no stranger than a house-owner swapping his burnt down house for cash if he has paid his insurance. The example using TeliaSonera illustrates some of the properties that have made credit derivatives so popular. The bank can sell its credit risk on the company, entirely or partially, without needing to cancel the loan or to have any discussion at all with the company. At the same time, the buyer of the credit risk (the seller of the credit derivative) does not need to tie up more than a fraction of the capital that would have been required to take over the credit directly. Moreover, the buyer of the credit risk can in turn easily sell the risk to another party, wholly or partially. Reinsurance thus becomes both simpler and cheaper to manage than with regard to traditional credit insurance. Large investors such as mutual fund companies and insurance companies often want to have a particular amount of credit risk in their portfolios. The credits can actually reduce their total risk, as the prices of the credits do not have such large covariation with other prices, for instance, the prices of shares and real estate. A certain share of credits provides a more diversified portfolio, which gives lower risk for a given expected return. Credit derivatives also makes it possible to divide up credit risks into small parts and to trade these parts at a low cost. This is not possible with traditional credit insurances. As the trade is so extensive, the pricing of credit risk becomes much improved. From the economy's point of view, it is essentially positive that the credit risk is spread to institutions outside of the bank system. Although the banks are specialists in assessing credit risk, they are also sensitive to shocks. Deposits are liquid, while loans are in practice often tied for long periods. If the depositors suddenly want to withdraw their money, it may be difficult as the bank cannot as quickly call in all its loans for payment. In addition, the banks are of vital importance for ensuring that payments in the economy function. The fact that credit risks are spread to other institutions with significant equity, such as insurance companies, may thus reduce the risks in the financial system. Since its start in the mid-1990s, international trade in credit derivatives has expanded enormously. Developments have been particularly dramatic over the past five years. The outstanding volume in the credit derivative market has in round figures doubled every year since 2002 and amounted to almost USD 12,000 billion at the end of 2005. This incredibly large figure can be compared, for instance, to the total value of the world's stock markets, which at the same time amounted to just over USD 40,000 billion. Market growth has remained high since 2005 and shows no sign of slowing down. Perhaps the most important explanation for the large expansion in recent years is that the market has become increasingly standardised. This has made trading at a larger scale easier. Underlying assets The underlying assets largely consist of corporate bonds; these account for around 80 per cent. However, there are other types of credit, such as traditional bank loans and various forms of sovereign debt. The corporate bonds market currently covers more than USD 6,000 billion in global terms. This means that the outstanding volume in credit derivatives is more than twice as large as the total amount of outstanding corporate bonds. The reason for this is that credit risks are resold on the market through new derivative contracts. This is not actually any stranger than insurance companies selling part of their risks by reinsuring themselves, but it may be good to bear this in mind when looking at the statistics. Today, credit risk is priced on thousands of corporate credits through credit derivatives, although most of the trade is still in a few hundred very large companies. Companies in all types of industries and with different credit ratings are traded. Communication, such as the example of TeliaSonera, is one of the most traded sectors, together with the automobile industry and finance. The credit quality of the underlying bonds is generally very high. But appetite is increasing for underlying assets with low credit ratings. The standardised maturities have also increased in number with time and there is a tendency for longer maturities, five to ten years, to be traded more. Market participants and products The market for credit derivatives attracts a large number of market participants who have not been active in the credit market earlier. The most important buyers of credit risk are large institutional investors such as insurance companies and pension funds. Hedge funds are also large actors. The main sellers of credit risk are banks and other credit institutions who want to relieve themselves of parts of their credit risk, for instance to meet capital adequacy requirements from authorities or merely to use their capital more efficiently. In practice, the credit derivative market is centred on a few globally-active banks, which function as brokers in the trade. The ten largest counterparties on the market account for a good 85 per cent of the total volumes traded and are represented by large investment banks such as Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and UBS. At the same time as the volumes have increased, the products have developed. The largest growth is currently in the new products, including what is known as index products. Somewhat simplified, a typical index product reflects a portfolio of credit risks in different companies, instead of reflecting the credit risk in a single company. The index products increase the investors' opportunities to spread their investments in the credit market. In this context, I would also like to mention that there are alternative credit insurance methods that have likewise developed strongly. One of these is traditional syndicated loans. A syndicated loan is a loan where a bank sells parts of the loan to other banks; this is usually done internationally. These loans, like credit derivatives, have the advantage of spreading the risk in a large credit exposure over many hands, but are not traded so actively in the market. Another means of selling risk is to put together a number of credits to form a portfolio and then finance this portfolio by issuing bonds. This is called securitisation. The portfolio is often sliced up into different risk tranches, and the bonds corresponding to each tranche are sold to different investors, depending on what risk the investors are willing to bear - and to what price. These products in themselves are sufficient material for a whole speech - so let me just note that credit derivatives are not unique when it comes to trading in credit risk. I have now gone through a number of advantages with credit derivatives and described their remarkable growth. But at the same time, they have brought with them a number of risks. These are mainly related to the market being new and relatively untested. There is a possibility of ""teething problems"". Let me therefore comment one at a time on what I regard as the four major causes of concern with regard to the credit derivatives market. The most concrete source of concern is how the trade is conducted in practice. The existing infrastructure in the market has not managed to keep up with the rapid development. Because of the explosive increase in the number of contracts, routines and handling procedures have lagged behind. The back-office functions at the largest counterparties have not been able to confirm all of the deals in time. This has entailed a risk of problems if ""large"" credit events were to suddenly occur. In these situations there could be confusion as to which deals have been completed and which positions are actually held, and these paves the way for legal disputes. The large number of outstanding contracts also makes the settlement process particularly sensitive. If many contracts have to be settled at the same time, there may be disruptions. The credit risk in one and the same bond may have been resold through a large number of derivative contracts. Problems can arise in this type of chain, particularly if the underlying bonds need to be delivered physically. But much has already been done to reduce the problems in this area. The market participants have themselves made large investments to reduce the number of confirmations ending up in a queue. Today there are automatic systems for confirmations and these now process most contracts. Experiences have also shown that the settlement process can be managed smoothly even when a large number of contracts are settled at the same time. An increasing number of contracts are also being settled in cash rather than through delivery of an underlying bond. On the legal side, there is always the fear of disputes. Will the person taking over the credit risk actually pay when a credit event occurs? It is not unusual for major disputes to arise in the insurance market regarding the interpretation of policy terms. But the problems of unclear rules and practice that existed when the market was new now seem to have been resolved for the most part. This is because they use almost exclusively international, standardised contracts. However, the possibilities for completely standardised solutions are still limited. There are so many different types of more or less complex credit derivatives. According to the market participants themselves, the legal risks in credit derivative trading have not been completely removed. The second source of concern is risk management. A bank that buys credit protection through credit derivatives will get rid of the credit risk, but instead expose itself to counterparty risk, that is, the risk that the party selling the credit protection cannot pay. Counterparty risks exist in most financial agreements, but as the credit derivatives market is so young and growth is so rapid, there is particular reason to be aware of them. There is insufficient statistical data available and it is difficult to assess where the risks will end up. At the same time, risk management within banks has developed significantly over the past ten years or so. Banks that trade in credit derivatives normally have strict routines for checking and evaluating their counterparties. Moreover, the sellers of credit derivatives are often insurance companies and pension funds, and have large equity capital to deal with potential credit losses. I would also like to point out that the large trading volumes I mentioned earlier should not be translated directly into risks. It is, of course, very unlikely that a seller of credit protection would need to compensate the entire credit risk in his portfolio. For this to happen, all of the companies concerned would have to go bankrupt at the same time, and with zero recovery. To return to the example of house insurances, this would mean that all houses insured by a particular insurance company would simultaneously burn down to the ground. This is a worse scenario than any town fire in our history. But one should not forget that various shocks in the economy can lead to substantial total credit losses. Bank crises around the world have proved this. Thirdly, there is reason to be aware of possible liquidity risks. Problems may arise if the market actors rely on the market always being liquid and assume this when making their deals. What would happen, for instance, if several credit events were to occur simultaneously? Perhaps there would suddenly be only sellers and no buyers in the market. Then prices will plummet. This was the case during the Russian debt crisis in 1998, for instance, when the LTCM hedge fund suffered problems. A crisis of this nature risks spreading rapidly to other financial markets and possibly threatening the lending banks. Such situations do not last particularly long, as buyers always appear when prices fall. This was also the case after the LTCM crisis. Remember also that the credit derivatives market and the market for the underlying bonds are tightly interwoven. If the premiums on credit derivatives increase substantially, this will mean that at the same time the return on the underlying bonds increases. Unless something important has happened that affects the credit rating of the company that has issued the bonds, it will sooner or later become profitable to buy them - or to buy the credit derivatives. Several large-scale credit events in recent years, such as the downgrading of Ford's and GM's credit ratings last spring, have also shown that more or less serious problems could be solved without liquidity in the market being affected to any great extent. Finally, I would like to bring up the risk of mispricing, a risk that in many respects is closely related to the liquidity risk. During the same period as the volumes of credit derivative have grown most, interest rates have gradually fallen and credits have increased. There have been unusually few bankruptcies. The interest rate differences between high-risk and low-risk bonds have therefore declined, that is, credit spreads have shrunk. The price of credit derivatives has fallen correspondingly. The compensation for risk has thus reached a level far below the historical average. The question is what will happen when economic activity shows a downswing and the number of bankruptcies begins to increase again. If investors have in general underestimated the credit risk, we may see a substantial adjustment in risk premiums. This will also lead to a fall in prices of corporate bonds and credit derivatives. In this situation, individual actors with large net exposures in credit risks may be affected by significant losses. But I would like to emphasise that this is a general line of reasoning. If risk premiums rise, this would have effects on most markets. There is no particular reason to assume that the credit derivatives market would be hit harder than others. My opinion is that each of these risks should be taken seriously. But they are nevertheless not so large that they risk bringing about a serious systemic crisis in the international financial system. I have now discussed the credit derivatives trade in the international market. Here in Sweden trade in credit derivatives is still very limited. But let me nevertheless round off with a few comments on the Swedish market and its potential. As you may know, Sweden currently has one of the world's most developed derivative markets. This is seen in relation to the size of the economy and the turnover on the stock market. But when it comes to credit derivatives, the situation is different. Here the trade is much more limited. This is primarily due to our corporate bond market being so small. And without corporate bonds, it has been difficult to trade in credit derivatives. The major Swedish banks base their core activities on long-term customer relations. Credits to small and medium-sized companies are predominant. The banks' exposures to companies traded actively in the credit derivatives market are relatively small. Moreover, the banks have had plenty of capital and the need to sell credit risk to outsiders has been limited. The number of deals in credit derivatives has increased in recent years, but the total exposures remain small, on the whole. The major part of the trade has been on behalf of customers. This means that the banks mediate deals for customers, for instance, insurance companies, which for various reasons want to buy or sell credit risk. If we look ahead, there is reason to believe that credit derivatives will gain increased significance. This is partly related to the new capital adequacy rules, Basel II. The Basel rules, the old and the new, regulate how much capital a bank needs to cover the risks in its credit portfolio. The risks depend, for instance, on how well-diversified the credit portfolio is. The more concentrated it is to certain industries and countries, the greater the capital requirement. A portfolio where the risks are well spread instead reduces the total risk in the portfolio and thereby the capital requirement. This means that the banks may have reason to sell some of the risks that arise in their own credit granting and to buy others instead. The current rules do not allow the banks to reduce their capital very much when they use credit derivatives. Basel II increases the opportunities here. It is also likely that the credit derivatives market will to a greater degree develop to include traditional loans. It is already possible to obtain prices for credit derivatives for companies that do not have bonds issued on the bond market. This is on condition that the loan documentation meets the predetermined requirements. It increases the opportunities for Swedish banks to use credit derivatives to sell parts of their own credit risk. Let me round off. My assessment is that the advantages of credit derivatives exceed the risks for the economy. They have revolutionised the trade in credits in important aspects. The problems related to the market infrastructure are being dealt with successfully and there are many indications that the risks in this field are declining as the market matures. The financial sector has also improved its routines for risk control over the past ten years. I am therefore not particularly worried that the situation in the credit derivatives market could cause serious problems for financial stability. The important thing is that the systemically-important banks manage exposures to their counterparties - that is, that they take sufficient collateral, they have sensible limits and they are capable of managing potential liquidity problems. But the Riksbank will, of course, continue to follow developments and act to ensure that the risks I have mentioned today are managed properly. With regard to Sweden, the direct impact of credit derivatives on risk in the bank sector is currently small. But I assume that we will see increased activity among the Swedish banks, partly because the banks' customers are calling for it and partly to manage the risks in their own balance sheets. The new capital adequacy rules may well contribute to this. It is therefore important that the Swedish banks report their management of credit derivatives in a way that makes both the trade and the total credit risk transparent. Here there is room for further development. So don't forget credit derivatives - they will continue to increase in importance. And don't forget that they are essentially insurances, neither simpler nor more complicated than a normal home insurance.

International economic developments are very strong. Although it is possible to discern some signs of weakness in the United States linked to the housing and vehicle markets, the European economies are growing at a slightly faster rate than anticipated. Most indications are that international growth will overall be in line with the forecasts the Riksbank made in February. Another positive sign is that there is renewed optimism in the stock markets after a decline earlier this year, and an increased willingness among financial market agents to increase high-risk positions,"" Mr Nyberg began. ""In Sweden, too, growth is currently high. During the spring the Government has put forward proposals for new tax cuts that will increase households' disposable incomes. This, combined with higher wage increases, could contribute to more rapid growth in consumption in the future. Increases in public expenditure can also contribute to increased public consumption and production in the economy. Several central wage agreements have been signed recently and the outcomes of these appear so far to be higher than is compatible with the forecast for wages we made in February. The improved labour market situation, with lower open unemployment than expected, also indicates that on the whole there is reason to make an upward adjustment to the forecast for wage increases over the coming ""Inflation has so far this year been higher than in the February forecast, largely due to the fact that oil prices have risen. Apart from oil prices, a number of other prices have also risen more than expected, including fruit and vegetable prices, which on occasion fluctuate relatively substantially. House prices are continuing to increase at a rapid rate, although there has been some slowdown in the rate of increase. But the higher prices in the property market also follow a rapid growth in credit to households,"" Mr Nyberg pointed out. ""We Executive Board members noted in February that the repo rate needs to be increased further in future so that inflation will develop in line with the target and so that developments in the real economy are balanced. At the meeting on 3 May we were all agreed that the interest rate path needed to be raised slightly, but there were marginal differences of opinion as to how quickly this should be done. My view was that recent developments provided justification for quicker action and therefore advocated raising the repo rate. The majority of my colleagues did not agree, and I therefore chose to enter a reservation against the ""My stance is based on concern over developments in several important factors, which I have mentioned above. The outcome of the wage bargaining rounds so far indicates that the costs for companies will increase, which in turn risks leading to higher inflation than expected. It can be added here that developments in the labour market remain strong. Although the balance in the labour market looks reasonable in total, one cannot disregard the possibility of bottlenecks in certain sectors increasing wage costs further. Household consumption may also grow more than expected, partly as a result of the tax reductions notified by the Government. Finally, developments in property prices and the related rapid credit expansion are a source of unease, both in Sweden and other countries,"" Mr Nyberg pointed out. ""The major challenges in monetary policy at the moment are, in my opinion, linked to two questions. The first question concerns how quickly the rising demand will have effects on inflation, which in turn is related to how long we can expect continued good growth without hitting the capacity ceiling in various industries. In other words, this question is strongly linked to how productivity develops. The other question concerns what effect credit growth in the short term will have on inflation, and here we are unfortunately lacking in knowledge. Although there is considerable uncertainty with regard to both questions, my assessment is that the risks to both inflation and developments in the real economy are at present clearly on the upside,"" concluded Mr Nyberg.","['economic', 'economy', 'forecasts', 'economies', 'incomes']","['sweden growth', 'forecasts riksbank', 'economy present', 'economies growing', 'future increases']","['sweden growth currently', 'consumption future increases', 'economic developments strong', 'economies growing slightly', 'growth consumption future']"
4384,r080210a_SRB,sweden,2008-02-10,Monetary policy and financial stability - the Riksbank's two main tasks,rosenberg,0,"Many countries are currently in the midst of a financial crisis that has repercussions throughout the global financial system. Headlines referring to problems in large US banks, to rising risk premiums, poorly functioning markets and other consequences around the world have been prominently featured on the first pages of many newspapers. Sweden has so far been spared the worst. But now the financial markets here are also clearly affected by the uncertainty and lack of confidence, which thus also affects the Swedish banks and other financial agents. The Riksbank is working intensively on dealing with these events right now, like most other central banks. The Riksbank's task is to safeguard both price stability and financial stability. I am going to talk today about current monetary policy and the deliberations at our most recent monetary policy meeting in September. But the recent drama in the financial markets gives me reason to devote some time to explaining what our task of safeguarding financial stability concerns and to our assessment of the current situation. Some of the questions that have been the focus of attention are what the Riksbank and other central banks can and should do about what is happening in the financial markets right now. It is not surprising that these questions arise. But if they are to be discussed, it is important to separate the two tasks the Riksdag (the Swedish parliament) has given us - monetary policy and financial stability. This may not be so easy, as the areas in many ways affect one another. However, I shall try to make things a little clearer. What is happening right now is important, both with regard to financial stability and monetary policy. The financial turbulence has also been included in our analyses of both areas, ever since the problems connected to the mortgage market in the United States became apparent last summer. However the perspectives are different. The stability perspective concerns how the banks, the payment system and the financial system in general are affected by the financial crisis. The monetary policy perspective concerns how inflation and developments in production and employment may be affected. As I recently mentioned, our two fields of activity are closely linked. The financial turbulence that has spread around the world to a large extent has its roots in the problems in the United States, linked to financial stability. This has led to extensive losses in the bank system in the rest of the world, to considerable uncertainty and poorer functioning in the financial markets. This is of course important to economic activity. However, economic activity in its turn affects factors that are important to financial stability. For example, the number of company bankruptcies and loan losses in the banks is usually higher when economic activity is low and vice versa. There is also a fundamental relationship between our fields of activity. The Riksbank's most important tool in conducting monetary policy is the repo rate. One can say that we try to influence economic activity and inflation by steering the price of credit, that is, interest rates. But to be able to do this, the payment system and our interest rate steering system must function. Financial stability is therefore actually a necessary condition for being able to conduct monetary policy efficiently. With regard to financial stability, the Riksbank makes regular updated assessments. I shall soon return to our views on current developments. But before I do so, I would like to say a few words about what the task of safeguarding financial stability actually entails. Most people are probably aware that we have an inflation target for monetary policy. But what do we mean by financial Financial stability is not so easy to define. In the Sveriges Riksbank Act the Riksbank's task that we commonly refer to as safeguarding financial stability is formulated as ""to promote a safe and efficient payment system"". Put simply, this concerns working in different ways to ensure that he financial system is stable and functions smoothly. This is important for many reasons. The financial system fulfils a number of functions that are fundamental to society and which most people probably take for granted. For example, individuals, companies and organisations must be able to make and receive payments in an efficient manner. Goods are transported to consumers via our usual infrastructure, for instance, the road or railway networks. When one then pays for the goods, one can say that the money is sent to the person who receives it via the ""financial infrastructure"" - the hub of which is our central payment system, RIX. Almost all financial transactions include some form of payment via the payment system. Without an efficiently-functioning financial infrastructure the economy will come to a halt. Another important function is to be able to save via the financial system. The funds saved become money that others can borrow. An efficiently-functioning credit market is a necessity in a developed modern economy. The financial system also makes it possible for those who invest to manage the risks that can arise. This is also very important for the development of the economy and actually for society to function well on the whole. So how do we work to fulfil our task? For one thing the Riksbank monitors and analyses the financial system, in particular the major Swedish banks, but also the efficiency of the payment system as a whole. We identify possible risks and threats to the financial system and evaluate the system's resilience. This is done for instance in our Financial Stability Report, which is published twice a year, and in speeches held by Executive Board members. We also try to influence market participants who are important to financial stability. Part of this work includes regular contacts with the banks, other government agencies and our central bank colleagues in other countries. Most of our work concerns preventing problems and ensuring that the payment system functions as smoothly as possible. We can do this in many different ways. Some concrete examples are the recent actions taken by the Riksbank and other government agencies. I shall return to what these actions entail shortly. We work to prevent financial crises from arising. But if they do nevertheless arise, it is also our task to manage them. We have to be prepared to take action although we hope that we will never need to do so. This preparedness includes, for instance, regularly holding crisis exercises, both internally and together with other Swedish authorities, and sometimes together with central banks and authorities in other countries. The work on financial stability is reminiscent of fire safety work. We have to provide information about the risks, but it is also our job to be prepared to put out the ""fires"". And to be able to do this efficiently, we must have practised. In purely practical terms, we have the possibility to take a number of different measures if this should prove necessary. But one should bear in mind that each situation is unique and must be dealt with on the basis of the conditions prevailing at that time. One fundamental function of a central bank is the role as ""lender of last resort"". If the Riksbank's assessment is that financial stability is threatened, we have the possibility, in exceptional circumstances, to contribute liquidity to Swedish banks and other financial companies by granting liquidity assistance on special terms. However, this assumes that these institutions are sound and that they are under the supervision of Finansinspektionen, the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority. Let us assume, for instance, that a bank that meets the requirements and thus is assessed as having assets that are greater than its liabilities, nevertheless experiences severe problems in financing and acquiring sufficient liquidity to meet its payments. I shall briefly explain how such a situation can arise. In general, the banks finance themselves by borrowing money in the short term and lending it out on a longer term basis. When the banks lend to individuals and companies it is often on long-term contracts, which means that the bank cannot get the money back earlier if this should prove necessary. On the other hand, when the bank receives deposits from individuals and companies, they usually have the possibility to withdraw the money whenever they wish. Also when the banks borrow money in the financial markets this is often as short-term loans, that is with a short duration. If it should suddenly become difficult or very expensive for the bank to borrow money, it may experience difficulty in meeting its payments. The terms for the more long-term lending are largely restricted. In such a situation the Riksbank can help to manage the bank's financing problems by granting liquidity assistance. But we only do this on condition that the terms I recently mentioned are met and if our assessment is that the stability of the financial system would be jeopardised if the bank in question failed. Another fundamental function that it is important to mention in this context ""to keep the different tasks separate"" is that the Swedish banks can borrow overnight from the Riksbank against collateral at an interest rate of 0.75 percentage points above the repo rate. They always have this possibility and this is not what we mean by liquidity assistance. But what if the bank suffering problems does not have larger assets than liabilities? Should the Riksbank provide liquidity assistance? No, in such a situation it is a question for the government, not the Riksbank, to decide. What the Riksbank can do is provide additional liquidity under certain conditions. We do not have the task of managing a bank's problems with its creditworthiness. Even in this hypothetical reasoning it is important to point out, that in principle all those who have deposited money in the bank are protected by the deposit guarantee in the event that a Swedish bank should default. This applies for amounts of up to SEK 250,000 per customer and institution. It is only if the deposit has been made by another financial institution or in some cases if the amount is frozen that the deposit guarantee does not apply. This reasoning concerned what we could do in a situation where financial stability is threatened. Some central banks have recently been forced to take this type of measure. But none of the Swedish banks has had problems with its liquidity in the way I described in my example. So how do we view the current situation? As I mentioned earlier, the financial turbulence has been included in our analyses for some time now, both with regard to monetary policy and financial stability. The Riksbank has regularly emphasised many of the risks in the financial system and what could happen if the financial turbulence should grow worse. The Riksbank bases its assessment on an analysis that focuses on the four major Swedish banks, as they account for around 80 per cent of the market. The Swedish banks have considerable equity, good profitability and limited loan losses. Our assessment is that there is a high degree of resilience to the international turmoil that has prevailed for some time now. But this is not the same as saying that the Swedish financial markets and banks are not affected by the situation. Of course they are. The international markets where the banks obtain funding by taking out bond loans have been functioning poorly. Borrowing has become more expensive and more difficult. Normally the financial market participants trade with one another and thus contribute to the smooth functioning of the market. However, recently above all mutual distrust has meant that they are more wary of lending money to one another. One can say that this has ""thrown sand in the wheels"". Many central banks and other government agencies are trying to counteract this, as I will discuss shortly. This has also affected the Swedish banks, although the problems have been less serious here than in many other parts of the world. We can observe that short-term interest rates have now risen substantially in Sweden, too. This applies, for instance, to the interbank market, which is the market where the banks borrow money from one another to cover their shortterm liquidity needs. However, in this context it is worth pointing out that the overnight market has functioned as usual and that the overnight rate, the shortest interest rate in the economy, has remained stable around the repo rate. In this way the Riksbank's system for steering the interest rate functions well, which is of course important not least for monetary policy. The market for mortgage bonds has also functioned less efficiently than normal. In times of uncertainty investors often prefer to buy safe assets and sell those that are higher risk, even if the latter have a higher return. So when the situation becomes uncertain the demand for government securities with a short duration, such as treasury bills, usually increases. At the same time the demand for less liquid securities considered to have a higher risk declines. As an example, in the United States they have been selling off mortgage bonds, as these have been regarded as particularly high-risk investments as a result of the US mortgage crisis. But even in Sweden there has been a strong demand for treasury bills with a short duration, at the same time as the supply of mortgage bonds has increased. This has occurred despite the Swedish mortgage bonds having a very high credit rating. Normally these have an interest rate just marginally higher than the rate for treasury bonds with a corresponding duration. However, recently the interest rate differentials between these securities have been much higher. The Swedish National Debt Office and the Riksbank have maintained a regular dialogue regarding the money and bond markets and the need to counteract the effects of the US financial crisis. To alleviate the problems here, the Swedish National Debt Office, in consultation with the Riksbank, decided two weeks ago to increase the supply of treasury bills through a number of additional auctions and at the same time buy, by reverse repo as it is called, the corresponding amount of mortgage bonds. These measures mean in total that the Swedish National Debt Office will probably have invested around SEK 150 billion in covered mortgage bonds by the end of November. However, there is also a flexibility to adjust the issue volumes on the basis of market developments. It is worth noting that the Swedish market for mortgage bonds has been open during the whole period of financial turbulence, although it has functioned less efficiently than before. Just over a week ago the Riksbank also increased the possibility for credit for the participants in the RIX payment system. The purpose of this is to facilitate the banks' payments to one another during the day, where necessary. To oil the wheels a little, one might say. RIX participants can now to a greater extent use their own covered bonds, or those issued by an institution with close links, as collateral in the system. The collateral for a covered bond is directly tied to a particular portfolio of mortgage loans with high collateral. This means that the credit granter is protected, even if the institution issuing the bond were to collapse. Covered bonds are therefore good collateral and many other central banks accept them to a greater extent than the Riksbank. In our case, the permitted share was raised from 25 per cent to 75 per cent. This measure meant, to put it simply, that participants in the RIX system, were given the opportunity if necessary to use more collateral as a base for their loans from the Riksbank. Another preventive measure taken by the Riksbank has been to establish, together with other central banks, a swap facility with the US central bank, the in exchange Swedish krona if the need should arise. But it should also be pointed out that the Riksbank has a substantial foreign currency reserve. The agreement is not the only means for the Riksbank to obtain loans in US dollars, but it makes it easier for us to take action quickly. Right now, the situation regarding shortterm funding in USD has been very strained on many markets. To increase access to liquidity in US dollars and to make the markets function more normally, several central banks, including the Riksbank, have agreed on coordinated actions. The Riksbank has decided to lend dollars to Swedish banks in two auctions during October. The first was held yesterday and amounted to USD 7 billion. A second auction with loans extending over the turn of the year will be held on 22 October and amount to USD 15 billion. A large part of the collateral the banks pledge for these loans will probably be comprised of covered mortgage bonds. The measures should therefore also have a positive effect on the functioning of the mortgage market. Together with the measures taken by other central banks, this should lead to better liquidity in the financial markets globally. A further measure is that the Riksbank as recently as today decided to establish a loan facility in Swedish krona to increase access to loans of longer duration. There have thus been disruptions in the financial markets, but the Riksbank, other government agencies and central banks have taken action to improve the functioning of the markets. We will of course continue to follow developments very closely. We are constantly updating our analyses and we are prepared to take action if necessary. In addition, as I have already mentioned, we have close contacts with the banks, market participants, other government agencies and our central bank colleagues in other countries. When the Executive Board met for our most recent monetary policy meeting on 3 September, the decision was to raise the repo rate by 0.25 percentage points to 4.75 per cent. However, the forecast for how the repo rate would develop in future was lowered in relation to the interest rate path that had been presented in July. The July forecasts contained a fairly high probability for a further two raises during the autumn. But at the September meeting the Executive Board's assessment was that there would not be any more raises and that the interest rate might need to be cut during 2009. The decision was reached by a narrow majority. Three members of the Executive Board supported the decision, while three were against it, and the Governor's casting vote was decisive. I was part of the minority who wished to hold the repo rate unchanged at the September meeting and to see a slightly faster reduction in the rate in the future. The main reasons put forward by the majority for raising the interest rate were that inflation had continued to rise and was far above the target, that inflation expectations remained high and that cost pressures had increased. The majority assessment was that it was necessary to raise the repo rate to prevent the increases in energy and food prices from spreading to other areas. The reasons for lowering the interest rate path included the fall in the oil price and other commodity prices over the summer. Another reason was that growth had slowed down more than expected, both in Sweden and abroad. The turmoil in the financial markets was of course also included in the picture. I personally had entered a reservation as early as July against the forecast that it would be necessary to raise the repo rate a couple more times during the autumn. At the September meeting I considered that the arguments against further interest rate raises were even stronger. Although inflation was high and far above the inflation target, the information received during the summer indicated that inflation would be weaker in the future than we had predicted in July and my assessment was that the risk of contagion effects had also declined. Let me explain my reasoning at the time. There were three main areas where my assessment differed from that of the majority. These were economic activity in Sweden and abroad, the risk of contagion effects from the increases in oil and commodity prices in the world market and to what extent the weak productivity risked leading to inflation effects. Oil and food commodity prices had fallen slightly during the summer, but were still a good bit higher at the time of the September meeting than they had been a year previously. There was also considerable uncertainty over how they might develop in the future. But my view was that the risk of these prices rising again had declined as a result of the clear weakening in economic activity both in Sweden and abroad. I also assessed that the risk of contagion effects on wages and prices in other areas had declined. I therefore considered that no further increase in the interest rate was necessary to counteract these effects. I would like to take the opportunity to answer the criticism against us that we care too much about the price of oil and food commodities in the world market when we make our monetary policy decisions. The reason given is that we cannot affect these prices with our monetary policy. Of course it is quite true that we cannot affect world market prices. But nor have we tried to stop the direct effects of the upturn in oil and commodity prices. If this had been our aim, the interest rate would have been much higher than it is now. Inflation is also much higher now than our target, because of the direct effects of higher commodity prices. The reason we have not tightened our monetary policy severely is out of consideration to the real economy, production and employment. However, what we are anxious to see is that the indirect effects of the increases in oil and food prices are not allowed to push up inflation more permanently. We conduct a flexible inflation-targeting policy. If shocks occur that mean inflation will deviate from the target, we can allow it to take some time to attain the inflation target. The normal time horizon is a couple of years, but sometimes it may be sooner and sometimes it may need to take a little longer. With regard to growth in Sweden and abroad, my views were more pessimistic than the assessment presented in the September Monetary Policy Update. Developments in the United States appeared particularly uncertain. The crisis in the housing sector, together with falling employment and weaker growth in real wages meant that I found it hard to believe that the US economy would turn upwards as quickly as assumed in the forecast. Moreover, the forecast for global growth assumed that there would not be any substantial slowdown in economic activity in the emerging economies. However, my assessment was that growth would also weaken there. The rises in energy and food prices entail cost increases and reduce purchasing power in these countries too. I also pointed out the rapid slowdown in the growth rate in the euro area. All in all, I considered there were risks that economic activity abroad would weaken more than was forecast in the In Sweden, there were clear signs of an economic downturn as early as the monetary policy meeting in July. In September we could see that growth in the second quarter had slowed down much sooner than expected. The situation in the Swedish labour market remained strong, but even here there were indicators, such as labour shortages, the number of job vacancies and redundancies, pointing to a cooling down. Productivity in Sweden has been weak since the beginning of last year. This means that unit labour costs as measured in the National Accounts are increasing more quickly. There is thus a risk that companies will try to pass on their cost increases to consumers, which would result in higher inflation. However, I considered that this risk is slight at present, now that economic activity is slowing down. The labour market usually lags behind production in the economic cycle. Employment has risen rapidly in recent years and when demand and production slow down as quickly as they are now, my assessment was that companies are more likely to cut their workforces rather than raise prices substantially. The redundancies announced at the beginning of the autumn may be an indication that many companies have had to reduce their labour forces. To summarise, my assessment was that inflation would slow down sooner than was assumed in the Monetary Policy Update. It was therefore my conclusion that no further interest rate increase was necessary to bring inflation back on target within a reasonable period of time. Further, my assessment was that the repo rate might need to be cut more than indicated by the proposed interest rate path and I therefore entered a reservation against the new interest rate path. The Riksbank, like many other central banks around the world, is currently facing difficult challenges. But although they are difficult, we are well-equipped to meet them. For instance, we have an entirely different starting point from that during the finance crisis of 1992, which largely concerned problems that had originated here at home. Today we are suffering contagion effects from problems in the US mortgage market, a market to which the Swedish banks have only small direct exposures. The situation with regard to monetary policy is also quite different from during the early 1990s. The inflation target and the current regulations regarding monetary and fiscal policy together with sound public finances provide a stable base on which to stand and meet the coming economic downturn. Even if the Swedish banks are affected by current events, they have good capital buffers and good earnings, and are therefore well-equipped to meet the turmoil in the financial markets. The biggest problem for the banks at present is to borrow at longer durations. The Riksbank, together with other government agencies and central banks, has taken measures to improve the situation. We are also prepared to take further measures if necessary.","['riksbank', 'crises', 'banks', 'bank', 'interbank']","['stability riksbank', 'markets riksbank', 'decide riksbank', 'situation riksbank', 'concerns banks']","['financial stability riksbank', 'financial markets riksbank', 'stability riksbank regularly', 'markets riksbank government', 'stability riksbank makes']"
4562,r170704a_SRB,sweden,2017-07-04,The distributional effects of monetary policy,ohlsson,0,"Price stability is a prerequisite for sustained economic growth as well as full employment and it prevents an arbitrary redistribution of income and wealth."" This is how the Riksbank concluded its press release on 15 January 1993, when the inflation target was announced. The link between monetary policy, growth and employment has been very much in focus over the almost 25 years that have passed since then. The distributional effects of monetary policy, on the other hand, have been more or less overlooked, until the question came into the spotlight again in recent years. When the Riksbank decided in early 1993 to begin steering its policy towards an inflation target, it was starting from a period when the major problem had been a high rate of inflation and also a rate of inflation that fluctuated substantially from one year to the next. Having a high inflation rate is as we know a problem in itself, but it also becomes more difficult for households and companies to make financial decisions, as the real value of savings, investments and debt is affected by large fluctuations in inflation. If inflation is higher than expected, borrowers benefit from the value of the debts being eroded, while lenders and those with large savings are correspondingly disadvantaged. This type of arbitrary distribution between lenders and borrowers was common during the 1970s and The inflation target, together with the reforms of the fiscal policy framework and the changes in wage formation in the 1990s, has contributed to inflation in Sweden both coming down to a lower level and becoming more stable than before. The same has happened to inflation rates around the world. It is therefore not surprising that the question of the distributional effects of inflation and monetary policy disappeared from the economic policy debate. However, in recent years the question has become topical again. One reason for this is a growing insight that the distribution of income and wealth may have considerable significance for the effects of monetary policy on the economy as a whole. And it is therefore important to understand the relationships better. Another reason why this has become topical again is the rising asset prices and the effect that monetary policy has on the distribution of income and wealth. We have gone through a long period where inflation has been low and central banks around the world have struggled to bring inflation back up to their respective target levels. One might therefore think that the question of monetary policy's distributional effects has become topical because inflation has been higher than expected, which has benefitted some groups at the cost of others. But this is not actually the main reason; instead it is the efforts the central banks have made to increase activity in the economy and to bring up inflation. Low interest rates have contributed to a rapid rise in prices of shares and other assets, both financial assets and real assets. This effect in itself should be inconspicuous. Asset prices normally rise when interest rates fall, which occurs in periods when monetary policy stimulates the economy. However, recent years have been special in many ways. Apart from policy rates being low for an unusually long time, the Riksbank and other central banks have also used other methods to further push down the general interest rate level, for instance purchases of government bonds. The monetary policy measures have affected asset prices in a more direct and visible manner than the conventional policy of interest-rate cuts. This has contributed to more discussion of the distributional effects of monetary policy. The distributional effects of the central banks' asset purchases have been in focus in, for instance, the United States, the United Kingdom and in Germany, where there has been considerable discussion of the effects of low interest rates for savers. In Sweden, the Riksdag Committee on Finance has included distributional effects in the questions that are to be included in the ongoing review of the monetary policy framework and the Sveriges Riksbank Act - in the terms of reference for the review it says that the committee making the review shall consider in particular whether the Riksbank should give consideration to the consequences that conventional and unconventional monetary policy may have on, for instance, the distribution of income in the economy. Explaining why the distribution of income and wealth changes is a challenge that is not made easier by the fact that the statistics in some cases lag behind and in other cases have large gaps. Those of you who have read Piketty's best-seller also know that one can give the question of distributional effects much greater room than I have scope for today. What I want to say with these reservations is that those of you who are expecting to hear exactly how great the distributional effects of monetary policy have been will unfortunately be disappointed. My somewhat more modest aim is to make a contribution to the discussion by examining the distributional effects of the policy and adding shades of meaning to these effects. What I hope to convince you of today is that monetary policy also affects household income and wealth in ways that are more indirect, but probably more meaningful, than via asset prices. While an expansionary monetary policy entails rising asset prices in the short term, this is compensated by lower unemployment, higher employment and stronger growth. A monetary policy that succeeds in the task of attaining price stability also counteracts the negative distributional effects of inflation. But, as I said, rising asset prices have been an element of the economic upturn in recent years. And during periods when stock prices are rising, the income distribution is more uneven between households - this can be seen from standard measures of dispersion of the income distribution, such as the so-called Gini Figure 1. Gini coefficient for disposable income and stock market movements As I mentioned earlier, there is nothing unusual in asset prices rising during periods when monetary policy is stimulating the economy. On the other hand, it is of course unusual that monetary policy has stimulated the economy to this extent and that the Riksbank has not eased up on the accelerator as economic activity has continued to increase and asset prices have risen. So a natural first question is: why has monetary policy been this way? The short answer is: because the inflation target is worth defending. You have heard my colleagues on the Executive Board and I say it many times before, but it is worth repeating. From my perspective, the inflation target of 2 per cent has played a central role in the Swedish economy - and I am sure I share this opinion with many of you here today. We have had considerable benefit of households and companies, savers and investors, expecting a future rate of inflation that is on a reasonably low level and that their expectations are more or less consistent with one another. This has contributed to a completely different stability in pricesetting and wage formation over the past two decades than in the two decades prior to this, which has in turn contributed to inflation falling at the same time as we have had more stable and much higher real wages on average. That high and fluctuating inflation has disappeared as a disturbing factor should also have meant that financial decisions by households and companies have in general become simpler and better. But the key to this type of development is a joint anchoring of inflation expectations and a condition for this is that the inflation target of 2 per cent is perceived as credible. This is the problem that has marked the Riksbank's monetary policy in recent years. In January 2015, when I became a member of the Executive Board, we were in an unfortunate situation where inflation expectations in the longer run were losing their anchorage around the 2 per cent target. Monetary policy had been expansionary for a long time and further measures were needed to strengthen confidence in the target and to send very clear signals about the Riksbank's intentions to bring inflation back to 2 per cent. But how can this be done in an environment where interest rates are already very low to start with? It is important to remember that there has long been a trend with falling interest rates around the world - a trend that has nothing to do with monetary policy, but rather concerns ageing populations and other structural factors that have pushed up savings in relation to willingness to invest. In the midst of this the central banks have also had to manage the effects of the financial crisis and a protracted economic slump. Many of them, including the large central banks like the ECB and the Federal Reserve in the United States, have conducted an expansionary monetary policy to support the recovery and bring up inflation, both via very low policy rates and via more unconventional measures such as various asset purchase programmes. Monetary policy in Sweden has also needed to take this into account. So to safeguard the upturn in economic activity and inflation in Sweden and to turn around the negative trend in inflation expectations, we have cut the repo rate down to a negative level, and with effect from the beginning of 2015 we have implemented an asset purchase programme to make our monetary policy even more expansionary. Our assessment is that this monetary policy has by and larger been successful. Market rates have followed our cuts in the repo rate and become negative. And the bond purchases seem to have pushed down interest rates more or less in the way we expected. Monetary policy also seems to have had the desired effect on inflation and inflation expectations. The upturn in inflation that began in 2014 has continued, and the downward trend in long-term expectations has turned into an upward trend since the beginning of 2015. Another sign that the expansionary monetary policy has had an effect is that we have had strong economic activity in Sweden. Growth has been high and employment has increased. At the same time as the expansionary monetary policy has contributed to the economic upturn, asset prices have risen. They can be affected by monetary policy through several different channels. Lower policy rates mean that bond yields become lower, at the same time as prices of bonds rise. If the central bank also purchases bonds, this puts further downward pressure on yields and further upward pressure on prices. Those selling the bonds to the central bank may also wish to adapt their portfolios and buy other assets, which means that the prices of these assets will in turn rise. The central bank can also, by means of various types of communication on monetary policy, make it clear that the expansionary policy will continue for a longer period of time, which can contribute to a more positive view of activity in the economy. This can in turn contribute to asset prices rising. The Riksbank and other central banks are well aware of all of these channels. Expansionary monetary policy affecting asset prices in this way is actually a part of the transmission mechanism for monetary policy, that is, the way that monetary policy spreads through the economy. But the effect on asset prices is not the objective of the policy. The objective is that the expansionary policy - through the effects on interest rates, asset prices, exchange rate, access to credit, expectations and so on - will in a couple of years contribute to increasing activity in the economy and bringing up employment and inflation. It is important not to lose this perspective in discussions of the distributional effects of monetary policy, as it broadens the spectrum of effects to more than just those coming through asset prices. Moreover, it points to the difficulties in determining the size of the distributional effects of monetary policy. One such difficulty is assessing what should actually be considered an effect of monetary policy and what is rather an effect of the conditions for monetary policy having changed. In a system like the national economy, it is not an easy task to distinguish between cause and effect. The Riksbank does not operate in a vacuum; it adapts its monetary policy to changing circumstances. Moreover, if monetary policy were not adapted to new circumstances, this would also have distributional effects. It is therefore not entirely correct to compare the income and wealth distribution after a period of expansionary monetary policy with the distribution prior to these measures being taken. The point of comparison should rather be how the distribution would have looked without the expansionary monetary policy. Another difficulty is what time perspective one should have to determine the effects of monetary policy. I have argued that it is important to take into account the total effect of monetary policy on the economy. Asset prices are affected relatively rapidly, but it takes time before the total effect of monetary policy has an impact on the real economy and ultimately inflation. Moreover, a common starting point when discussing the effects of monetary policy is that in the long term it is neutral with regard to real economic quantities such as growth, unemployment and income distribution. In this perspective, one can therefore argue that monetary policy should only have minor distributional effects, if any at all. The effects of an expansionary monetary policy during economic slumps should be counterbalanced by the opposite effects of a tight monetary policy during booms. It may of course be reasonable to take as a starting point that monetary policy is neutral in the long run. But there are factors that may point to a need to modulate this starting point. Some research results indicate that the effects of expansionary and contractionary monetary policy are not necessarily symmetrical. There are also mechanisms that make the risk of staying unemployed increase the longer one is unemployed. Add to this that the income profile over the life cycle improves considerably if one has a job. This could mean that there are motives for conducting a relatively more offensive monetary policy in economic recessions. But here more research is needed to gain a deeper insight into the causes and scope of this type of persistence effects on unemployment and what these effects mean for monetary policy. The effects of monetary policy on income and wealth distribution are in other words rather difficult to disentangle. But let us look at some different ways in which the expansionary monetary policy conducted in recent years may have affected the income distribution. An appropriate starting point could be the functional income distribution of GDP. As we know, GDP can be measured from different sides, for instance as the total of all factor income. Somewhat simplified, the income comes from two main sources: remuneration to the labour force in the form of wages and other benefits and remuneration to capital in the form of yield and profits. Both of these types of remuneration have increased over the past three years, and GDP has increased by a good three per cent on average in real terms. But the question is how the growing incomes have been distributed among households. Households differ with regard to the size of the income they receive from different sources. In general, labour income is in relative terms the most important source of income for households in the lower and middle parts of the income distribution, while capital income has the most significance for those at the top - particularly the very top - of the distribution. As monetary policy affects wages and capital income in different ways, the overall effect may differ from one household to the next. It is this channel from monetary policy via the composition of household income on which the debate has focused the most - rising asset prices should have benefitted households at the top of the income distribution to a relatively large degree and thus contributed to a greater income dispersion. However, households do not only differ with regard to the composition of labour and capital income. There are also relatively large variations between households with regard to the distribution of capital income from capital gains, yield and interest on different types of asset and liability. The effect of an expansionary monetary policy on income and wealth distribution can thus vary for this reason, too. Households' capital incomes may, for instance, differ in their sensitivity to changes in interest rates. All else being equal, low interest rates benefit household with relatively large debts as interest payments become lower. Households with bank savings are correspondingly disadvantaged and households with relatively large interest-bearing assets thus have a lower yield. Here the maturity of the different assets and liabilities also plays a role. If, for instance, mortgages are mainly at fixed interest rates, the effect of interest-rate cuts will be less than if the loans are primarily at variable rates. A comparison between different income groups shows that liabilities as a percentage of disposable income are more than 250 per cent in all groups in Sweden (see Figure 2). With the exception of the group with the lowest income, however, there is generally little difference in the debt-to-income ratio between the groups. Figure 2. Debt-to-income ratio in different income groups 2016 In addition to households having different sizes of assets and liabilities that are affected by interest rates to different degrees, there may also be other dimensions that play a role in how the distribution of income and wealth is affected by a period of very expansionary monetary policy. For instance, one can imagine that household that are used to managing their assets and liabilities have better conditions for safeguarding themselves against or benefitting from the effects of monetary policy on interest rates and asset prices. However, the distributional effects of monetary policy do not come solely through changes in nominal interest rates and asset prices. Ultimately, it is the effect when consideration is given to inflation that is important. And the composition of household wealth is also significant in this context. To begin with, households are more negatively affected by an expansionary monetary policy that increases inflation if they have a relatively large share of assets that have poor or little protection against inflation. Cash is of course the most obvious example, even if it may in this context be of less significance for the wealth distribution, given how the use of cash has declined in Sweden. The real value of all assets and liabilities is of course affected by how high inflation is and I have earlier mentioned the redistribution between borrowers and lenders as an effect of an unexpectedly high or low inflation rate. An unexpected increase in inflation, for instance, that monetary policy has become more expansionary than expected, reduces the real value of assets and liabilities. This can, for instance, benefit households with relatively large debts on houses and apartments, but disadvantage low income households who rent their homes. Households with large financial assets are also disadvantaged, but they are perhaps more used to, and better able to, adapting their assets to avoid the inflation risk. Hence, to study the distributional effects linked to increased capital income, it would be interesting to see how assets and liabilities are distributed between households. When it comes to liabilities, there are relatively good statistics available, but with regard to the distribution of various assets, we are unfortunately fumbling in the dark to some extent. The collection of data on financial assets and liabilities at household level ceased with the abolition of the wealth tax in 2007. The financial and national accounts do provide some information on how households' various financial and real assets have changed on aggregate. But when it comes to wealth developments for individuals, we do not have much to go on, as the statistics in principle came to a stop in 2007. There have been admirable attempts to estimate developments since then via the capitalisation of incomes and expenditures, but the quality cannot of course be compared with register data. Several commissions in recent times have noted that there is a substantial need for up-to-date wealth statistics at individual level to be able to analyse specific questions such as financial stability risks and over-indebtedness, but also to gain a deeper insight into the income distribution in general. So far we have discussed the different channels by which an expansionary monetary policy can affect income distribution via capital gains, yield and interest rates. As you will note, however, I have avoided saying anything specific about the size of the distributional effects. As I mentioned earlier, it is difficult to determine exactly how large these effects are and not even their direction is always evident. But rising stock prices and thereby larger profits when selling these assets will tend, all else being equal, to lead to a more unequal income distribution. The effect of the expansionary monetary policy on capital incomes, via rising equity prices, should therefore have led to a more unequal income distribution. However, capital income is only one part of households' total income; the largest part is comprised of labour income. As with capital income an expansionary monetary policy can affect the labour income of different households in different ways. For some households the hourly wage may be what primarily determines their income development, while for others the number of hours worked is the most important thing - and above all whether or not one actually has a job. As monetary policy affects these quantities in different ways, income distribution will also be affected. In Sweden, it is primarily the differences between the income of those who have a job and those who do not that is important to the income distribution, rather than the wage differences between those who work. This is clearly visible in the dispersion of disposable income, that is, income including work and capital income, as well as various transfers and after taxes are deducted. The higher the disposable income, the less common it is that one's main source of support is from something other than labour and capital. People who receive unemployment benefit are mainly found in the lower part of the distribution, as are those with sickness benefit and other benefits such as activity compensation and financial support. It is also clear that the group with the lowest income includes people who according to the Swedish Public Employment Service have a vulnerable position on the labour market, for instance, those born outside of The strong economic activity in recent years has meant that demand for labour has increased, which has meant that employment has shown a rising trend. Unemployment has also fallen, which is impressive given that the number of people in the labour force has at the same time increased. This development has reasonably, all else being equal, had a levelling effect on the distribution of income. An observation supporting this argument is that employment among those born outside of Europe has actually also begun to increase, albeit from a much lower level than for the other groups. Of course, it is not possible to ascribe the whole of this distributional effect to monetary policy - in the same way as it cannot account for the whole distributional effect of rising asset prices. But it is quite clear that the expansionary monetary policy has contributed to the strong development of the labour market in recent years. Another aspect of the improvements in the labour market that is relevant here is the link to future pensions. The focus is often on individual pension savings, but households' total pension wealth also contains savings in collective funds, for instance, in systems for occupational pension schemes and premium pensions. The fact is that this form of saving currently comprises around half of total financial assets (see Figure 3). Moreover, we all have pension assets linked to the general income-based pension, which are not in funds but are linked to the pension rights we earn until we retire. Whether or not one has a job does play a major role for the size of the collective saving and the general income-based pension. It determines whether or not one receives an occupational pension and is also important for one's income profile during the working life. Lower unemployment and higher employment should therefore have a levelling distributional effect for this reason, too. Figure 3. Collective financial assets as a proportion of total financial assets With regard to the funded pension savings, the period with low interest rates has been a strain. Yield has been low and this has put pressure on the pension funds to meet the guarantees in their insurance plans. This has sometimes been raised as a negative effect of the expansionary monetary policy, but the problem - to the extent that it is a problem - is rather connected to the global falling trend in longterm real interest rates. In light of this, economic agents need to adjust to interest rates probably not returning to the levels we previously considered normal. But at the same time, it is important to remember that interest rates in the long term will nevertheless be much higher than they are now. If I am to summarise my presentation today, let me first say that I think it is a good thing that distributional effects are once again being discussed with regard to monetary policy. I believe that we can learn a lot about the impact of monetary policy on the economy by studying how monetary policy interacts with the distribution of income and wealth. Today I have focused primarily on the question of what distributional effects the expansionary monetary policy conducted by the Riksbank and other central banks may have had. The debate has so far mainly focused on the effect of rising asset prices. I have tried to nuance this picture and pointed out the importance of actually looking at the total effect of monetary policy on the economy, as well as using the correct point of comparison. My point can be summarised roughly as: without the expansionary monetary policy, growth and employment would have been lower and unemployment would have been higher. This would hardly have benefitted any group in society, and especially not those with the lowest incomes. Assessments of the distributional effects of the expansionary monetary policy should be regarded in the light of this. It is also important to note that no group would have benefitted from a decline in confidence in the inflation target. The whole idea behind the inflation target was that stable prices create good conditions for economic growth and high employment, as it was formulated in the Riksbank's press release in 1993. This is also a perspective that needs to be included in the discussion of distributional effects and monetary policy. Finally, my view is that overall resource utilisation in the Swedish economy has now passed normal levels and can be expected to rise even higher in the coming years. At the same time, we see ahead of us that inflation will rise towards the target. It is therefore probable that the Riksbank sooner or later will first ease up on the accelerator and then begin using the brake. In my opinion, it is wise to start thinking now about how such a scenario will play out. Monetary policy will then be unable to stimulate activity and the labour market in the same way as in recent years and this will of course also have distributional effects. It is important that focus is then aimed at other policy areas, where the responsibility for distributional issues is more natural. , Bank of England (2012), The distributional effects of asset purchases. sysselsattning och inkomster - okar klyftorna i Sverige?

4863,r170111a_SNB,switzerland,2017-01-11,"Credit, debt and growth",zurbrugg,0,"Returning to one's alma mater is always a special occasion. It was 28 years ago that I completed my doctorate here at the University of Berne. Since then, my professional career has taken me to a variety of places, but there has always been one topic accompanying me on the way: the topic of debt. In my first job at the Federal Finance Administration at the end of the 1980s, I was charged with analysing the Latin American debt crisis. Then, at the end of emphasis was on resolving the debt crisis in Asia. Back in Switzerland, my efforts went into implementing the debt brake at federal level. And even switching to the Swiss National Bank (SNB) in 2012 was no escape. The European debt crisis had a major impact on the Swiss franc exchange rate and on our monetary policy. In addition, we at the SNB are very carefully monitoring the risk to financial stability inherent in the rise of mortgage debt in Switzerland. As you can see, the topic of the Collegium generale's lecture series has played a major role throughout my career. I was therefore very pleased to be invited to deliver a speech today on credit and debt. I'm deliberately using these terms in conjunction here. Because ultimately they refer to the same thing. They describe an agreement between two parties. One party, the creditor or lender, entrusts money or other goods to the second, the debtor or borrower, who promises to return the money or goods at a later stage. The borrower's financial debt represents an asset of the lender's. And yet, although the terms refer to the same concept, the associations they generate go in opposite directions. In common speech, the word debt usually has a negative connotation. Debt sounds like something to be avoided. Whereas the word credit gives rise to positive associations. Credit opens up new possibilities and is a bedrock of growth. The different way in which the two terms are perceived is also reflected in their etymology comes from the Latin debitum , from the verb debere , which means to owe something, or to have an obligation. The word thus has a moral overtone. for its part goes back to the Latin words credere , meaning to believe or to trust, and creditum , referring to something entrusted in good faith. So which is it? Are debt and credit - I will be using these terms to describe a single phenomenon in the following - something positive or negative? Over the next hour, I would like to pursue this question from an economist's perspective. Let me save you the suspense and reveal the result of my reflections with an analogy. Sustainable lending is like maintaining a healthy, well-balanced diet. Food is one of the pillars of our life. In equal measure, lending is a pillar of a thriving economy. However, eating unhealthy food or eating too much produces only a short-lived sense of gratification and is likely to lead to health problems in the long run. These will then have to be battled with tedious diets or even medical treatment. In the same way, unhealthy or excessive lending can trigger crises. Far-reaching intervention by governments and central banks is then needed to bring the ensuing turmoil under control. Ladies and gentlemen, this is what awaits you in today's speech (cf. slide 3): First, I want to explain why a thriving economy depends on loans just as much as we human beings depend on food. Next, I would like to discuss why time and again, throughout history, there have been cases of gluttony at the 'credit buffet', and why these can have far-reaching consequences. Finally, based on current developments on the Swiss credit market, I will show up ways in which such downsides can be kept in check without curtailing the advantages offered by the credit system. My main focus thereby will be on what central banks can and should do. Lending is one of the cornerstones of a successful economy based on the division of labour. This fact has been recognised since ancient times (cf. slide 5). As much as 5,000 years ago in Mesopotamia, seeds for crops were made available on loan, with repayment including interest due after harvest. Loans were also commonly used in ancient Greece and Rome. Lending in its present form dates back to the emergence of the 'modern' banking system in Europe in the late Middle Ages. To this day, banks fulfil key functions in brokering loans. Without them, efficient large-scale lending as we know it would not be possible. recently, alternative methods of credit provision have emerged thanks to digitalisation - P2P or crowd lending for example. Nevertheless, banks remain the mainstay of an effective credit system. I will now explain why growth and prosperity would be significantly lower without an efficient credit system. To do so, I need to clarify the two basic functions of loans (cf. slide 6). First, loans enable borrowers to have future income at their disposal now. And second, loans allow creditors to make optimal use of their available capital. Let me explain this in greater detail. Regarding function number one: Without loans, expenditure at any given time is limited to one's savings and one's current income. The possibility of taking out a loan expands this limit by adding anticipated future income to the resources available for spending. Why can this be a good idea? The somewhat banal answer is because making certain purchases or investments before having saved up the required amount can have a beneficial effect. Here are a few examples to show that this holds true from the point of view of companies, households and governments. Let's start with the example of a start-up by a university of Berne graduate. This graduate has come up with a brilliant idea for a new product. To develop and produce it, she needs capital. She herself has no savings and it would take her decades to accumulate the required amount on her own. Under these circumstances, she would probably give up on the idea. The possibility of obtaining credit radically changes the situation. A loan enables her to realise her idea within a short time and generate income with the sale of her product. The example shows how loans make it possible even for firms with little capital to make investments that will generate income in future. In the best case scenario, such investments also drive technological progress. Thus, loans do not only benefit the company concerned, but also contribute to raising an entire economy's productivity, growth potential and prosperity. Households, too, can harness future income for present-day benefits. The obvious example is a mortgage to buy a house. Let's take a specific case. A young family - we'll call them the Miller family - is expecting a child and so will soon need larger living quarters. They have found their dream house, but the money they have saved so far is not sufficient for them to buy it. Thanks to the possibility of taking out a mortgage, the Millers can nonetheless purchase the house of their choice and move in without further delay. The family will from then on be using part of their income to repay the loan, thereby reaping present benefit from their future earnings. In other words, they are putting their income to use at a time when they derive the greatest advantage from it, and in doing so they enhance their prosperity. Finally, borrowing can also make perfect sense for a government. Fiscal income and expenditure are not always in balance. During a recession, for instance, a state's income declines, whereas expenditure increases due to the activation of various countercyclical measures such as the provision of unemployment benefit. The result is a fiscal deficit. Governments can cover the deficit either by temporarily raising taxes or by reducing their spending. Neither of these measures are helpful in a recession. On the contrary, they would merely aggravate the recession. Borrowing money enables the government to bridge temporary gaps between income and expenditure without having to resort to higher taxation or short-term cuts in spending. As we have seen, borrowers can make optimal use of their income over time thanks to the credit system. From a lender's point of view, too, providing loans generates substantial benefit. This brings me to the second basic function of the credit system. The possibility of lending enables available capital to be invested as profitably as possible, and enhances the diversification of investment risk. For society as a whole, it means that accrued savings are made widely available and thus put to better use. Let me give you an example. An entrepreneur is faced with the question of what use to make of his assets. There is no major purchase to be made at the moment. Neither is there a profitable project at his own company in the pipeline. Do you remember our university graduate with her brilliant idea for a product? The entrepreneur could lend her some of his assets against interest and so generate a return. By extending a loan to the young graduate, he is also diversifying his investments. As the proverb has it, he is not putting all his eggs in one basket. Overall, we can conclude that an effective credit system represents an essential basis for a thriving economy. It allows borrowers to put their income to the best-possible use over time. And it give lenders the opportunity to invest their accrued assets in an optimal way. Individuals benefit from this mechanism, and so does the economy as a whole. As the examples show, the credit system can support prosperity and economic growth and enhance the growth potential. Given all the positive aspects, the possibilities and opportunities linked with the credit system - why then the negative image associated with the notion of debt? As mentioned at the beginning, the term 'debt' emphasises the borrower's obligation to repay the loan in future. Each credit/debt relationship is therefore fraught with the risk that the borrower might incur financial difficulties and be unable to repay the loan. The cartoon here makes a tongue-in-cheek reference to this credit risk (cf. slide 8). Naturally, credit risk is also inherent in the case of our university graduate's start-up. There is a rule of thumb in the start-up scene that says only one in ten start-ups succeeds. If her product idea fails, our University of Berne graduate will lack the funds to repay her loan and interest. And the Miller family's mortgage loan is not exempt from credit risk, either. Payment difficulties could arise if, for example, a divorce or rising interest rates lead to an unexpected hike in current expenses, or if the family's future income is reduced by unemployment or illness. In such cases, borrowers will of course do all they can to avoid a default and first of all try to lower other expenses. This may mean cutting back on non-essential consumer spending or postponing maintenance work or investments. A default, after all, has far-reaching consequences. In the case of the start-up, it could possibly lead to insolvency. The Miller family for their part might be forced to sell the house in an emergency sale. When borrowers face payment difficulties or default on their loan, this also causes problems for creditors. They will have to write off anticipated interest income and may even lose the money lent if the loan isn't secured by collateral. And even if the loan is secured - for instance by real estate - getting a good price for the collateral could prove difficult, depending on the circumstances. The examples show that an actual or impending default on a loan can represent a serious burden for the party concerned or even a personal tragedy. To a certain extent, this explains the negative connotations associated with debt. However, from a macroeconomic perspective, default by a single borrower does not usually pose a problem. Unless the single borrower happens to be a massively indebted state or big bank. An impending default by such a player has a far-reaching impact on the economy as a whole, as witnessed in the recent financial crisis. Debt also becomes a macroeconomic problem when a large number of economic agents help themselves too generously at the credit buffet table. Such phases of excess on the credit market usually end with a large number of borrowers encountering payment difficulties. the rest of my presentation, I would like to concentrate on this type of debt crisis and on the costs involved. Empirical literature indicates that recessions run particularly deep when they are connected with just such a debt crisis (cf. slide 9). Moreover, the subsequent economic recovery tends to be sluggish. This applies all the more when the debt crisis also hits the banking sector. Why is this so? In a debt crisis following a credit boom, not just a few, but a large number of households and companies face payment difficulties and have less income and assets at their disposal. Accordingly, they need to scale down consumer spending and investments over a relatively long period of time in order to service outstanding loans and reduce their excessive debt burden. In addition, such an environment usually leads to greater uncertainty, which also impacts on economic agents that are not directly confronted by payment difficulties. such circumstances, they, too, tend to show less appetite for consumer spending, investments and risk. Cutbacks in consumer spending and investments are even more pronounced when, at the same time, banks are busy cleaning up their balance sheets. They then become very restrained in their lending. This can even affect fundamentally profitable investments and borrowers with a high credit rating. All this places a burden on the economy not just during the acute phase of the crisis, but over a prolonged period. Lower investment also results in lower growth potential. Because less investment means less innovation, and less innovation leads to lower productivity growth. To put it in a nutshell, and to come back to the analogy of food: When, during an upturn, economic agents have taken excessive helpings from the credit pot, they will, in the wake of a debt crisis, be forced on a necessary, but long and painful diet. Thus, the correction of excesses on the credit market leads not just to economic downturns but also often to sustained loss of growth potential. For this reason, all economic agents should have a strong interest in avoiding any excesses which could end in a crisis. Nevertheless, historical evidence shows that periods of excessive risk-taking by individuals, banks, companies or governments occur with quite alarming regularity. Why do we learn so little from experience? Let me say from the outset, there is no one single reason for the repeated excesses on the credit market. A number of closely related factors all play a role. In the following, I will be looking in more detail at three of these factors (cf. slide 10). First, a favourable macroeconomic environment drives the supply and demand of loans. Second, the rational reaction of individual lenders and borrowers to the favourable environment can lead to a build-up of systemic risks. And, third, distorted expectations of economic agents also play a role. To illustrate these factors, I will use the example of the Swiss housing boom of the 1980s. Interestingly, analogous developments can be found in the lead-up to virtually every debt crisis. Initially then, the macroeconomic environment plays a major role. Increased lending is often associated with an economic upturn. A key variable here is the interest rate level: If current and anticipated rates are comparably low, loans tend to be taken out for projects which would not be profitable or not be financed at higher rates. Furthermore, lenders in such an environment often take higher risks in order to achieve return and growth targets despite the low interest rates. Other key drivers for the increase in credit are movements in prices of assets such as shares and real estate. Rising prices for these assets and growing credit volume often go hand in hand and are mutually reinforcing. This applies to the real estate market in particular, since real estate is almost always part-financed by loans. Two mechanisms are at work here: First, rising asset prices produce 'wealth effects' in households. Households become richer and thus more creditworthy. This has a positive impact on household demand for loans. At the same time, rising asset prices translate into higher-value collateral for households to use. This enables them to borrow larger amounts, which in turn leads to a further increase in asset prices. Second, credit risk from the lender's perspective falls with rising asset prices. During such periods, banks therefore tend to offer more loans and at more favourable rates. Developments in Switzerland in the 1980s illustrate these aspects clearly. From 1983, the Swiss economy recorded dynamic growth over several years. This upturn was temporarily challenged by the slump on the global stock markets in autumn 1987. Global central banks, including the SNB, reacted with a significant loosening of monetary policy that had a rapid stabilising effect. The economic upturn in Switzerland gained further momentum over the following quarters. The overall macroeconomic environment was therefore favourable. estate prices in this environment rose at an increasing pace between 1985 and 1990. volume of outstanding mortgage loans also climbed sharply. Back to the theory and to the second factor for excesses on the credit market. The previously described reactions of individual lenders or individual banks to the favourable environment contribute to the build-up of systemic risks (cf. slide 11). This means that from the individual's perspective, the expansion in credit demand and supply in a favourable environment may well make perfect sense. But, even if all parties behave rationally from their own point of view, there is still the risk that overall an excessive level of debt will build up that is unsustainable in the long term. Why is this? Individual lenders fail to take into account that their behaviour has an impact on the ability of other market participants to bear debt. This applies, for example, when investors are increasingly exposed to the same risks and invest in the same markets. For instance, let us assume that a large number of companies or households simultaneously take out loans to purchase real estate. This situation creates systemic risk because a negative surprise on the real estate market can lead to many of these investors incurring losses at the same time, forcing them to sell off their assets so that they can continue meeting their loan commitments. This can generate a self-reinforcing spiral of falling real estate prices, more borrowers who can no longer service their debts, and thus greater pressure to sell. Moreover, the behaviour of economic agents during a credit boom is not always entirely rational. This brings us to the third factor that can contribute to excesses on the credit market - distorted expectations (cf. slide 12). A glance at the history of financial crises shows: The longer an economic upturn persists, and the higher asset prices rise at the same time, the more over-optimistic economic agents are about future growth. At the same time, the more they underestimate the risks they are taking in purchasing assets or in taking out or granting loans for this purpose. Alan Greenspan and Robert Shiller coined the phrase 'irrational exuberance' to describe situations when investors, in their enthusiasm, ignore the investment risks. What creates these distorted expectations? Research in economic history and behavioural economics provides some explanations. The self-reinforcing dynamics between economic upturn, low interest rates, the rise in asset prices, and credit growth can induce market participants to feel justified in their optimism and their expectations of price developments. Government representatives, too, are often infected by this optimism. Who can predict the future? Perhaps there has indeed been a structural change in the economy. In other words: During an upturn, everyone finds ostensibly good reasons why a rise in asset prices and credit volume makes perfect sense and is fundamentally justified - despite historical experience to the contrary. The feeling that this time really is different is something that I experienced at first hand myself, when I lived and worked in Washington DC from 1998 to 2006. Local real estate prices during this period recorded average annual growth rates of some 15%. During our stay there, we kept asking ourselves as a family - should we rent or buy? Our answer was always the same: Rent, because these annual price increases cannot be sustainable. However, this argument became ever weaker with each new year of sharp price rises. Towards the end of our stay, we too were almost ready to switch camps to the adherents of fundamentally new economic principles in which real estate prices go in only one direction - up. But, as you all know, in 2006 the massive price correction set in after all. As an example of the build-up of systemic risks and the excessive optimism of economic agents, I can again also refer back to the Swiss real estate boom in the second half of the 1980s (cf. slide 13). Strong growth and income prospects and favourable conditions in the mortgage market boosted demand for property. Real estate was increasingly purchased for investment purposes since it promised high returns through value appreciation. The higher demand in turn led to further rises in real estate prices. Accordingly, the value of collateral and thus owners' assets continued to grow, as expected. Against this background, banks for their part were more optimistic about credit risks as the number of loan defaults remained low thanks to rising property prices and favourable credit conditions. As both credit volume and real estate prices rose higher, economic agents felt vindicated in their optimism. But if such a period of excessive optimism is followed by a downturn, the impact on these highly indebted agents is huge. The trend on the real estate market in Switzerland reversed in 1989 (cf. slide 14). Systemic risks materialised and considerable losses were registered. As investments were largely debt-financed, there was a flurry of loan defaults. Ultimately this led to banks in Switzerland having to write off more than 40 billion francs. To cut a long story short, the Swiss economy slid into recession at the beginning of the 1990s, unemployment rose sharply to 5% and the economy subsequently recovered only very slowly (cf. slide 15). Ladies and gentlemen, having shown you in the first part of my speech that loans are an essential basis for economic growth, I have now explained how excessive lending can seriously damage the economy. I have also outlined how a combination of rational behaviour and distorted expectations of borrowers and lenders can lead to harmful excesses in the credit market. But, you might say, the behaviour of borrowers and lenders, whether rational or based on distorted expectations, ultimately depends on interest rates. Only if interest rates are low, can such a dynamic develop. Interest rates in turn are strongly influenced by central banks. In the last part of my speech I would like to address this argument, and discuss the question that has come back into focus since the financial crisis: What role do central banks play in the event of excesses and crises on the credit market? The fundamental task of central banks like the SNB is to ensure price stability, while taking due account of economic developments (cf. slide 17). The main instrument they use for this are key or reference interest rates. If, for example, the inflation rate threatens to fall too low, key rates are lowered. This has a positive impact on price development via various channels. One of these is loans: An interest rate cut reduces borrowing costs and creates incentives for expanding the credit supply. This encourages investments and consumer expenditure and ultimately has a positive effect on price development, too. With their interest rate decisions, central banks therefore consciously influence lending practice. If, for price stability reasons, interest rates have to be kept low for a prolonged period, it is possible that over time there may be undesirable excesses in certain segments of the credit market. This poses a risk for financial stability. When using the interest rate tool in such a situation, central banks can face a conflict of interest between the objectives of price stability and financial stability. On the one hand, they have to keep interest rates at an appropriate level in order to guarantee price stability. On the other hand, they have to closely monitor the impact of this policy on the credit cycle and financial stability. In the case of the SNB, contributing to the stability of the financial system is part of its statutory mandate. Let me explain this point using the current situation in Switzerland. Internationally, interest rates have followed a downward trend for many years and are currently at low levels. In the case of Switzerland, this development caused the interest rate differential against other countries to narrow. Along with occasionally strong capital inflows during the financial crisis, this fall in the interest rate differential has led to substantial Swiss franc appreciation and a highly valued Swiss franc (cf. slide 18). In order to ensure price stability in Switzerland and to create appropriate monetary policy conditions in this environment, the SNB has had to keep interest rates low for several years now (cf. slide 19). A higher interest rate level domestically would result in further appreciation of the Swiss franc. This would cause a slowdown of economic growth and put the prices of goods and services under pressure. If this downward pressure on prices were to continue for a prolonged period, price stability would be jeopardised. The low reference rate maintained by the SNB is therefore necessary from a monetary policy perspective in the context of the low interest rate environment worldwide and the strong Swiss franc. At the same time, the persistently low interest rate environment presents risks to financial stability. This applies first and foremost to the real estate and mortgage markets. Like global interest rates, mortgage rates in Switzerland have been on a downward trend for some 25 years. Consequently, significant imbalances have built up on the real estate and mortgage markets. This is evident when we look at the developments in both markets since 2000 (cf. slide 20). On an inflation-adjusted basis, prices for single-family houses have risen by more than 50% overall. The volume of outstanding mortgages has almost doubled over the same period. These strong rises on their own do not prove the build-up of imbalances - the increases can be partly explained by fundamentals such as solid population growth. Since 2000, this has amounted to approximately 18%. A growing population produces a demand for more housing. As land for building development is limited, this puts upward pressure on real estate prices. At the same time, demand for mortgage loans grows. However, momentum on the mortgage and real estate markets has been considerably stronger in recent years than can be explained by such fundamental developments. The ratio between the volume of outstanding mortgage loans and nominal gross domestic product (GDP) since 2000 has risen from 110% to some 145% (cf. slide 21). Lending has thus grown significantly faster than income in recent years. At the same time, we can observe increasing risk appetite among banks in their lending business. This is because banks' income from interest rate differential business is suffering due to the low interest rates. By taking higher risks - in particular in mortgage lending - banks are able to counter this decline in income in the short term. Yet, this exacerbates their susceptibility to negative developments on the real estate and mortgage markets or to an unexpected sharp interest rate rise. Given the potentially far-reaching negative effects of a debt crisis as outlined in the second part of this speech, it is clear why the SNB has been carefully monitoring these developments for some time and pointing out the associated risks. But what should central banks do to counter excesses on the credit market? Should they raise interest rates, even if this would not be appropriate from the perspective of price stability and There are three reasons for not doing so. First, we have the rule postulated by Tinbergen in the 1950s (cf. slide 23), which states that for each economic policy target there needs to be a separate policy instrument. This reduces potential conflicts of interest when using instruments and contributes to the efficient achievement of each individual target. The Tinbergen rule is also justified in our case. If central banks were to use the interest rate tool for the purposes of financial stability, they might have to accept departures from the objective of price stability. Such an approach, though, would call into question the credibility of the central bank's avowed pursuit of price stability. In the long term this would have a negative impact on trust in the central bank and limit its ability to ensure the goal of price stability. Second, the crucial question is how effectively interest rate rises actually influence overheating in the credit market. I have already explained how the interest rate environment affects the behaviour of economic agents in the credit market. Higher interest rates, then, should have a dampening effect on credit growth. Yet various analyses indicate that it often takes a very sharp interest rate rise to significantly counteract excesses in the credit market. However, this would have an unwanted and severe dampening effect on the economy and lead to an undesirable deviation from the optimal course of inflation. Third, and connected with this, it is important to remember that interest rate rises affect the whole economy. Meanwhile, excesses often occur only in certain segments of the credit market. For these reasons it seems more expedient to curb excesses in the credit market primarily with instruments other than the interest rate tool. Of course, this presupposes that effective alternative instruments are available. The focus here is on macroprudential instruments instruments which are aimed at avoiding the build-up of systemic stability risks and are intended to make the financial system as a whole more robust to negative shocks. Macroprudential instruments have become more common since the global financial crisis. The application of macroprudential measures in Switzerland is currently particularly important in view of the significant imbalances in the credit and real estate markets. The emphasis in Switzerland is placed on the sectoral countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) and on guidelines that address credit demand (cf. slide 25). The sectoral CCyB obliges banks to hold more equity capital when imbalances build up on the mortgage market. The aim is twofold: First, banks with more equity are better equipped to absorb losses that can arise as a result of excessive lending growth. Second, costs for mortgage lending rise, counteracting the build-up of imbalances in this segment. The buffer is called countercyclical because capital requirements increase when the mortgage market is on the rise. This dampens the upswing and strengthens the safety buffer of banks and of the financial system. The requirements are reduced in a downturn when banks have more capital available to absorb potential losses on loans. This mitigates the likelihood of systemic risk materialising and leading to a downwards spiral of emergency sales and loan defaults. Acting on proposals by the SNB, the Federal Council activated the sectoral CCyB in 2013 and, in 2014, increased it to 2% of risk-weighted mortgage loans for residential property in In addition to the sectoral CCyB, there are two measures in particular which the industry introduced in 2012 in the form of self-regulation. These measures address the demand for loans: First, the obligation that mortgage borrowers have to supply a minimum amount of own funds. Second, the obligation that part of the loan has to be repaid within a set period if the loaned amount constitutes more than two-thirds of the property value. Along with the CCyB, these measures have helped to reduce momentum on the credit and real estate markets in the last three years (cf. slide 26).

4918,r200810a_SNB,switzerland,2020-08-10,What constitutes sound money?,jordan,1,"Ladies and gentlemen As the title of today's event clearly states: supplying the economy with sound money is a constant challenge. I am therefore particularly pleased to have the opportunity to examine the issue of 'What constitutes sound money?' with you in more detail here. After all, as Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, I represent an institution that is responsible for providing our country with sound money, a task we have performed since our foundation 113 years ago. Sound money is crucial in a society that is shaped by the division of labour and the exchange of goods and services - as has been demonstrated not least by the experience gained with a wide range of monetary orders over many centuries. Today, money is used in virtually all economic transactions. A sound monetary system is an essential prerequisite for a modern economy, for efficient trade and for social stability. Given how significant the monetary system is, it is only right and proper that the associated developments are also the subject of regular public debate. With this conference dedicated exclusively to the issue of sound money, you are making an important contribution in this regard. Sound money is a fragile accomplishment, and is thus essentially always at threat. However, against the backdrop of the global financial crisis, concerns that our good money could turn bad have increased markedly across broad sections of society in recent years. On the one hand, this is understandable. Central banks' crisis management has led to an extraordinary expansion in money supply and interest rates are at record lows - in the past, these phenomena have often been indications of imminent inflation and thus currency depreciation. On the other hand, it is a demonstrable fact that the value of money has never been as stable as it has been in the past 20 years (cf. chart 1). Viewed from this perspective, central banks' expansionary monetary policies have simply satisfied the enormous demand for central bank money. The strength of this demand is actually testament to a high level of trust in central banks. The fact that inflation has been held in check for so long may also explain the increasing popularity of ideas from an entirely different perspective. The proponents of modern monetary theory would like to see central banks being put at the service of state financing. Their take is that independent central banks are merely a troublesome relict and that monetary policy should largely be determined by the government's financing needs. But experience from throughout history shows that this would, sooner or later, end in an economic policy fiasco. As you can see, the positions are far apart, with diametrically opposed interpretations of facts. The aim of my speech is to provide some clarity from the perspective of Switzerland's central bank. To this end, I will set out some fundamental thoughts on the properties of sound money and the various types of money. I will then address the question as to whether, against the backdrop of our current monetary policy, the Swiss franc can still be described as sound money. But let us first take a step back and look at money as a concept. Money is a generally accepted medium of exchange, and performs two other important functions, namely as a unit of account and as a store of value. As a unit of account, money serves to make economic transactions comparable. In this function, it is also used for representing the nominal value of all kinds of claims and liabilities. As a unit of account for determining value, money plays a prominent role in virtually all walks of life - from the workplace to healthcare and pension provision. For money to be a generally accepted medium of exchange, it must be possible to use it to buy goods or services not only today, but also tomorrow, and the day after, and so on. Money can therefore also be used as a store of value. However, money is not the only means of holding and growing wealth, and it is often not the most profitable. Although it does offer security and flexibility, unlike risky financial investments it generates little or no return. So what constitutes sound money? My answer is unlikely to come as a surprise: money is sound if it fulfils its functions as well as possible. And this depends on its value being stable. Only if this is the case will it be broadly accepted as a medium of exchange over the long term. Furthermore, as a unit of account, money that is stable in value makes it possible and easier to plan and calculate, and it is also suitable as a store of value. However, the importance of money that retains its value goes far beyond these three narrowly defined functions. Sound money contributes to preserving the real value of financial claims with fixed nominal amounts, such as savings deposits, bonds, employment contracts and pensions. It thus creates security and trust, which in turn promotes social harmony and cohesion. Money is therefore sound if it neither depreciates nor appreciates, i.e. if there is neither inflation nor deflation. But how can we measure the development of the value of money over time? To do so, we have to take as our basis the development of its purchasing power. It thus makes sense to measure the value of money using a basket of goods and services that is as representative as possible of consumer spending, as Switzerland does with the consumer price index. The value of money thus depends on the transaction prices of goods and services, and its development over time can be measured using the price of the basket. Having looked at what constitutes sound money, let us now turn to the two types of money that are circulating in parallel in the current monetary system and that can be exchanged for each other: central bank money and bank deposits, that is to say book money of banks. Switzerland, central bank money comprises the banknotes issued by the SNB and the sight deposits held at the SNB by financial market participants, primarily banks. The Federal Act on Currency and Payment Instruments stipulates that the money issued by the SNB is legal tender in Switzerland and that the Swiss franc, which is divided into 100 centimes, is the Swiss currency unit. Central bank money and its unit of account thus form the anchor of our monetary system. The SNB's money defines the value and characteristics of our currency and thus also provides the basis for bank money. Bank deposits are not legal tender, however. They are instead much more a private claim against a bank. On demand, these claims can be exchanged one-to-one for central bank money, i.e. banknotes in the case of non-banks. Economic agents are prepared to hold bank deposits instead of central bank money as long as they have confidence in the bank's ability to pay and as long as the bank deposits offer them added value compared with central bank money. For instance, bank deposits facilitate the settlement of transactions - most of us would probably find it highly impracticable if wages and rent had to be settled in cash, for example. Bank deposits also offer protection against theft and are often a better means of preserving value than central bank money in that they normally generate a return. However, they do entail a certain degree of credit risk. In Switzerland, bank deposits account for more than 90% of the money held in Swiss francs by households and companies, with less than 10% being held in banknotes. It is therefore not enough for just central bank money to be sound money; bank deposits must be sound as well. But let us first consider the money that serves as the anchor of our monetary system. These days, central bank money is paper money: there is no defined obligation as regards convertibility into gold, which makes the issuing of money completely flexible. This brings considerable advantages. It allows central banks to adjust supply in line with demand and thus to keep the value of money stable over time. Thanks to this flexibility, in crisis situations a central bank can make an important contribution to damage limitation by supplying additional money and thus avoiding a shortage of liquidity in the financial system. This was scarcely possible under the Gold Standard. Owing to the convertibility into gold, the monetary base was largely static, which greatly exacerbated the recurring bank crises. Despite the glitter of gold, the currency system then was anything but stable, and many people lost their savings during banking crises. However, there are also many examples from history where paper money proved to be decidedly bad, as high inflation led to a rapid erosion of value with disastrous consequences in some instances for the economy, society and politics. The flexibility that is the defining feature of the paper money system is both its strength and its Achilles heel. Used properly, i.e. with the focus on the goal of value retention, this flexibility can contribute to the stability of economic development and the solidity of the banking system. However, things start to get dangerous when it is misused to solve political or structural problems by issuing central bank money - as advocated by the proponents of the aforementioned modern monetary theory, for example. The temptation to fulfil such wishes via the printing presses, by creating money out of thin air, is of course all the greater the more politicised monetary policy becomes. solidity of a paper money system therefore lies in three mainstays: a clear mandate for the central bank, setting as its target the preservation of price stability and thus ensuring sound money; protection from political influence by enshrining the independence of the central bank in law and actually putting this into practice; and healthy state finances. After all, experience shows that high government deficits mean increased political pressure on the central bank, and in cases where monetary policy has been politicised, there is a clear risk of significant currency depreciation sooner or later. We can thus now also answer the question as to when bank deposits constitute sound money. Having central bank money that retains its value is a key prerequisite for sound bank money. Since bank deposits in Switzerland are denominated in Swiss francs, their value is largely determined by SNB money. Sound bank money therefore hinges on sound central bank money, but that in itself is not enough. Bank deposits are only sound money if the bank in question is also solvent and liquid, in other words, if the depositors can rely on being able to exchange their deposits into banknotes or into deposits at another bank at any time without any problems. For this to be ensured in turbulent times as well, banks need to have a strong capital base and sufficient liquidity. They must be able to meet their obligations at all times, and therefore must not take on any excessive risks. This is the case if banks structure their business strategies accordingly and if regulation is focused on stability. This also reduces the likelihood of the central bank having to step in as lender of last resort, that is to say providing solvent banks with liquidity in crisis situations if they can no longer raise funds on the market. And so we come to today's key question: is the Swiss franc sound money or not? The fact is that the level of prices in Switzerland has never been more stable - and the Swiss franc's ability to retain value thus never higher - than in the past twenty years. And also over a longer-term perspective, the Swiss franc displays an exceptional ability to retain value by What are the reasons for this? The solidity of the Swiss franc is attributable on the one hand to the strength of the Swiss economy, and on the other hand to the stability of Switzerland's state institutions. The SNB is one of these institutions. Swiss central bank money has retained its value because the law guarantees the SNB's independence and gives it an unequivocal mandate to ensure price stability while taking due account of economic developments. Added to this, public finances are in good shape as far as debt is concerned, which reduces the political pressure on the SNB. The value of bank deposits in Switzerland is stable because the value of its central bank money is stable, because the banks are operating prudently, and because the regulation of the banking system is centred on stability. The strong capital base and high liquidity of the banks in Switzerland increase the resilience of the system in times of crisis and promote confidence among depositors. Both of these factors contribute to bank deposits retaining their value. Our findings are therefore rather reassuring. In Switzerland, central bank money and bank deposits are essentially sound money. However, there is no guarantee that this will always be the case. Or, to put it in somewhat more pointed terms: will the expansionary monetary policy that the SNB has been following for some years jeopardise the solidity of the Swiss franc in the future? Issuing too much central bank money can indeed undermine the foundations of sound money, especially if the money is created to solve political or structural problems. However, the unprecedented expansion in the monetary base in recent years does not pose a particular threat to the stability of the Swiss franc's value. With the increase in money supply, the SNB has simply reacted to rising demand, and its focus in doing so has been firmly on its mandate to ensure the stability of the Swiss franc and thus the supply of sound money. It is worth noting here that bank deposits, which are also relevant for the development of inflation, have grown at a comparatively moderate rate. Growth in the monetary aggregates referred to by economists as M2 and M3 has been much less strong than would have been expected on the basis of the increase in the monetary base or base money (M0) alone (cf. chart 3). In other words, there has been a marked decline in the money multiplier. The increase in base money reflects the rise in demand for the Swiss franc, which is seen worldwide as a safe haven in times of crisis. Without an expansion in the monetary base, money would have been excessively scarce and its price would have risen massively. This would in turn have led to a marked drop in the level of prices, our currency would have appreciated even more, and economic activity would have declined. Can this strong expansion be reversed when necessary? Yes, it can. If the demand for Swiss francs weakens, the supply of money can be reduced at any time, thus ensuring that the currency retains its value. The SNB has a wide range of ways and means at its disposal for absorbing liquidity. However, one important condition for a successful reduction in money supply is that the SNB must have unrestricted control over its balance sheet. And in particular, it must, if necessary, be able to sell foreign currency for Swiss francs, in the same way as it has been able to make foreign currency purchases in recent years. We therefore must also firmly reject any ideas aimed at channelling our assets into a sovereign wealth fund, even though we may be highly sympathetic to the matters in question, such as securing pension provision. In conclusion, allow me to stress once again how valuable it is to have a dialogue on the core issue of sound money. In my remarks, I referred to the crucial importance of the three mainstays of a robust paper money system: a central bank mandate focused on price stability, the independence of the central bank in setting monetary policy, and solid state finances. As we have seen, sound money is always subject to latent threats. It is essential that we remain on our guard if we are to identify these threats in good time and ward them off. What are the biggest threats to sound money at present? In my view, there are two developments in particular that we need to be watchful of. On the one hand, any move to make central banks an instrument of state financing would undermine the second mainstay, namely central bank independence. On the other hand, the consequences of the coronavirus crisis could also impact on the soundness of money. Overall, state financing needs and thus government debt have increased considerably as a result, and this could undermine the third mainstay if countermeasures are not taken over the medium term. In addition to this, many central banks have themselves bought exceptionally high amounts of their country's own sovereign debt. In a crisis, that may be the right thing to do in terms of monetary policy, but it must not be done for reasons of state financing. The challenge lies in safeguarding the clear separation of responsibility for monetary policy and fiscal policy even in this crisis situation, and thus ensuring that central banks remain independent in practice and not just on paper. It is particularly important to avoid scenarios where excessive government debt means that a central bank is de facto forced into making its decisions dependent on their impact on public finances. This would result in monetary policy no longer being centred on price stability and thus on sound money. Switzerland has been able to manage the additional debt well thus far thanks to the fact that its public finances were in good order when the crisis hit. That said, the coronavirus crisis has fuelled aspirations here, too. There have been mounting calls for the SNB to make massive additional profit distributions. However, there are two things to bear in mind here. On the one hand, the size of any distribution depends on the earnings potential of our investments. And on the other hand, a central bank's equity must be sufficiently high to cover the risks in its balance sheet. Ladies and gentlemen, a monetary system has to take account of the changing needs of the economy and society over time, and the evolving environment in which it exists. However, it is also important to note that it is an order that has developed over the course of history and any ill-considered interventions could entail serious consequences for our country and the population as a whole. Swiss monetary history has been characterised by a wide range of changes, but the desire for sound money has been a constant throughout. Today's paper money system with central bank money and banks' book money has stood the test of time. But if we want to be able to benefit from the advantages of this system in our national interests going forward, we must make sure now that the three mainstays of sound money can continue to perform their roles and provide support.","['monetary', 'soundness', 'currency', 'banknotes', 'sound']","['soundness money', 'sound monetary', 'money sound', 'sound money', 'economy sound']","['sound money switzerland', 'constitute sound money', 'regard sound money', 'described sound money', 'constitutes sound money']"
5046,r010904a_BOE,united kingdom,2001-09-04,The Recent Performance of the UK Labour Market,nickell,0,"Employment opportunity for all is the modern definition of full employment'. So says the Chancellor of the Exchequer in Spending Review 2000, the Treasury's public spending plans for the first four years of the 21 century. There is no question that one of the major challenges facing any industrialised country is to ensure that its labour market operates so as to enable people who want to work to do so at a reasonable rate of pay. So this will be our focus in what follows. In fact we consider two major issues. The first refers to the performance of the labour market from the macroeconomic point of view, and this we cover in Section 2. Here we look at unemployment and inflation, explaining why recent history from this perspective looks relatively benign and asking about the future consequences of some of the significant policy changes since 1997. The second major issue, dealt with in Section 3, concerns the imbalances in the labour market across different skill groups, focusing particularly on the problem of worklessness facing the unskilled. Again, we attempt to analyse why this problem has arisen and the main thrust of recent policy in attempting to resolve it. We then conclude with a summary of what we have learned. From the macroeconomic point of view, the UK labour market has looked remarkably healthy in recent years. Just to put the situation into a historical context, in Figure 1 we present the history of unemployment, inflation, inflation expectations and real wage growth. Since 1997, the following key factors stand out. Unemployment has continued to fall until the time of writing, reaching its lowest level for a generation. Inflation has remained remarkably low and inflation expectations among key wage bargainers have remained stable over the same period. Finally, real wage growth has been relatively healthy, so macroeconomic stability has not been purchased at the expense of cuts in average living standards. It is perhaps worth remarking that these trends since 1997 are essentially a continuation of what has been happening since 1993. However, the fact that unemployment on the ILO measure has fallen to 5 percent without any noticeable take-off in inflation is a fact of some significance. Part of this happy state of affairs is down to the monetary and fiscal policies which have been pursued and these we leave to others to discuss. The particular question we shall consider here is why unemployment has been able to fall to such a low level by the standards of recent history without any significant inflationary pressure. This suggests that the equilibrium unemployment rate, that is the level of unemployment consistent with the stable inflation , has fallen since the 1980s. So we begin by looking at the recent history of the equilibrium rate. Before going into detail about recent shifts in equilibrium unemployment, it helps to set the scene if we have some idea of the recent history of British unemployment. In Figure 1a, we showed the path of unemployment since 1970, using the standard ILO definition (that is, an unemployed person is someone without work who is actively searching for work and is available to take up a job). We can see that unemployment was moving gradually upwards in the early 70s, surging upwards rapidly after the first oil shock in 1974, again after the second oil shock in 1979, came down rapidly in the Lawson boom of the late 1980s and rose equally rapidly after 1990. Since 1993 it has gradually subsided so that by 2000 it reached its lowest level since the 1970s. Unemployment rate is the ILO measure. Inflation refers to the GDP deflator Inflation expectations refers to those of Trade Union negotiators twelve months ahead. Real wage growth refers to the Average Earnings Index relative to the RPI. To gain some understanding of these fluctuations, let us consider the period since the mid-1980s. In 1986, unemployment had been in excess of 11 percent since 1982. By the Spring of 1990, it had fallen below 7 percent. This dramatic fall was produced in part by expansionary fiscal and monetary policy, in part by an international boom and in part by a large fall in commodity prices in the mid-1980s. So why did the fall in unemployment come to an end? Basically because inflation, as measured by the rise in the price of UK output (GDP deflator), rose from 2.5 percent per annum in 1986 to 7.6 percent in 1990. Indeed during one month in 1990, the headline RPI rate reached double figures. Furthermore, by 1990, the trade balance was in deficit to the tune of 4 percent of GDP. Anxiety about these trends had set in by 1988 and the short term interest rate rose from around 8 percent in the Spring of 1988 to 15 percent by the Winter of 1989. This tightening of monetary policy had its effect on inflation and unemployment after 1990 and by 1993, unemployment had risen to over 10 percent with GDP price inflation falling to 2.7 percent. Again by 1992, the government was getting anxious about rapidly rising unemployment and once the UK had left the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, monetary policy loosened with short rates falling from over 10 to around 6.5 percent during 1992. Unemployment then started to fall and from 1994, GDP inflation started to rise, peaking in 1996. Since 1996, we have been in the benign state of falling unemployment and stable or gradually falling inflation. However, the balance of payments deficit has been gradually worsening since 1997. What does this story reveal? Basically it is consistent with a standard open economy natural rate view of the world. Thus, if economic activity gets too high and unemployment gets too low, inflation starts to rise. If unemployment gets too high, inflation starts to fall. Then we define equilibrium unemployment as that level which is neither too high nor too low and which is thus consistent with stable inflation. In practice, things are a bit more complicated because a high exchange rate can act to suppress inflationary pressure essentially by enhancing the effective level of foreign competition facing UK firms as well as by making imports cheaper. So, if the exchange rate is high, which usually shows up in the form of a larger trade deficit, this may prevent inflation rising even if unemployment is below the equilibrium rate. Formally, what this means is that there is a three way trade off between unemployment, changes in inflation and the balance of payments. If unemployment is below the equilibrium rate, either inflation rises and there is no balance of payments deficit or inflation is stable and there is a payments deficit or there is some we define the equilibrium rate as that consistent with stable inflation and a zero balance of payments deficit. Despite its name, the equilibrium unemployment rate may change quite significantly from one decade to the next. How and why it might have changed we shall discuss below. What is important to understand here is that, broadly speaking, it cannot be changed by monetary policy. This simply influences the way in which actual unemployment fluctuates around the equilibrium rate. Finally, although it is easy enough to talk about equilibrium unemployment, pinning down the number is less straightforward. Basically, it is influenced by any factor which systematically affects inflationary pressure in the labour market at a given level of unemployment. For example, changes in the power of trade unions, the operation of the benefit system, the match between the skill requirements of job vacancies and the available skills of unemployed job searchers, labour taxes, product market competition, minimum wages can all change the equilibrium rate. Furthermore, changes such as these do not act on the equilibrium rate instantaneously. Individual behaviour takes time to adjust to changes in the economic environment, so that the impact of changes of the type listed above on the equilibrium rate will tend to emerge gradually over a number of years. The easiest way of estimating the equilibrium unemployment rate is to take the actual rate and make a downward (upward) adjustment if inflation is falling (rising) or if the balance of payments is in surplus (deficit). The calibration of the size of the adjustment must be generated by some estimated model. In Table 1 we present some estimates of the equilibrium rate based on this method for various periods since 1969. We use periods of at least four years in order to smooth out year to year fluctuations. As we can see, for the most recent four year period, equilibrium unemployment is estimated to be 5.7 percent, although it should be recognised that there are considerable uncertainties surrounding this number. Over the period 1997-2000, the average level of actual unemployment is above this and the balance of payments is in deficit which is consistent with the falling rate of inflation. In fact, in the most recent year (2000), unemployment has fallen below 5.7 percent but this has not been associated with rising inflation because the high level of the exchange rate has helped to suppress inflationary pressure. In 2000, this was associated with a payments deficit of around 2 percent of GDP. Unemployment refers to the ILO rate, inflation to the GDP deflator. Potential GDP refers to actual GDP corrected for unemployment fluctuations. The equilibrium rate is calculated exactly as described in Layard et al. (1991), pp. 442-5 or Nickell (1990). As well as adjusting for inflation changes and the payments deficit, there is also an adjustment for unemployment dynamics. Notes: Prior to 1990, the values of inflation changes and the trade balance are lagged one year and two years respectively to account for the time taken for these factors to feed into unemployment. After 1990, we use current values because the reaction of unemployment to economic conditions increased in rapidity. For our purposes, the key feature of Table 1 is the steady decline in the equilibrium unemployment rate from its peak level of the 1980s, a decline which accelerated in the second half of the 1990s. The obvious question is what has brought this about. And the obvious place to look for an answer is at the workings of the labour market. Before going into detail, it is worth recalling that we should not expect shifts in the operation of the labour market to impact instantaneously on the equilibrium rate. As is well-known, it takes a considerable time for individual and organisational behaviour to respond fully to changes in the economic environment. That said, we shall now investigate successively changes in industrial relations, the benefit system and labour taxes. Changes in the system wage determination In most European countries, the majority of employees have their wages determined by Trade Union collective bargaining. In those countries where this bargaining operates in an uncoordinated and adversarial fashion, this tends to generate upward pressure on inflation at given levels of labour market slack leading to higher levels of equilibrium unemployment . In the 1970s and early 1980s, Britain was one such country. For a variety of reasons, which include the Trade Union Legislation introduced in the 1980s, the structure of wage determination in Britain has changed dramatically over the last 20 years. This is reflected in the numbers presented in These data reveal that the proportion of workers covered by Trade Union collective agreements has halved from its peak of 70 percent in 1980 and this decline has almost been matched by the fall in union membership. Looking at the private sector alone, which is the driving force behind wage inflation , we see that by 1999 membership is down below 20 percent with only a small minority of private sector workers being covered by collective agreements. Note: Coverage refers to the proportion of civilian employees whose pay was covered by a trade union collective agreement. Density refers to the proportion of civilian employees who are members of a trade union. Table 2. Note, the coverage data in 1999 (marked with an asterisk) are based on a different question in the Labour Force Survey than that asked previously. <25 emp. 25 emp. <25 emp. 25 emp. During this process, wage bargaining, even in the unionised part of the private sector, has become far less adversarial. Indeed the number of strikes is currently minimal relative to the level of disputes two decades ago. How has this change, which is almost unique in its scale among OECD countries, come about? Two factors are important. First, the Trade Union legislation of the 1980s moved the balance of power in disputes away from employees and made it harder for unions to organise. This made it less easy and attractive to join a union. Second, the heavily unionised sectors of the economy have been in relative decline over the whole period (except for the public sector). This process is exemplified by the numbers presented in Table 4. These show clearly how, in the private sector, newer establishments set up after 1980 are far less likely to be unionised than those set up before 1980. Set up before 1980 Set up after 1980 So as old establishments are replaced by new establishments, unionisation inescapably diminishes. This is almost the whole story. Derecognition in continuing plants is very rare (see Machin 2000, Table 2). So whatever these changes have meant for the working conditions of the average employee, there seems no question that they have contributed to the decline in inflationary pressure at given levels of labour market slack and hence to the fall in equilibrium unemployment . Changes in the benefit system There are four aspects of the benefit system which influence equilibrium unemployment. These are, in turn, the level of benefit, the duration of entitlement, the coverage of the system and the strictness with which the system is operated. In Tables 5, 6, 7 we present a partial picture of how the system has changed over the years. In Table 5, we see that the actual level of benefit relative to earnings has declined quite rapidly since the late 1970s, basically because of the abolition of earnings related supplement and the switch of indexation from an earnings basis to a price basis introduced by the first Thatcher administration. Note: The OECD measure is an average of unemployment benefit entitlement relative to average gross wages for three different family types (single, with dependent spouse, with non-working spouse) over the first five years of an unemployment spell. The Bank of England measures refers to the ratio of the total income while unemployed relative to the total, post-tax income while employed. It includes taxes and subsidies although it excludes housing benefit. Up-rating reverted to historical rather than forecast inflation 1983. UI reduction if in receipt of pension extended to over 55's. Extended from 6 to 13 weeks, 1986 and 26 weeks 1988.

Compulsory counselling and referral for unemployed workers with duration excess of six months, 1986. Interviewed every 6 months from Show good cause for refusing jobs. New claimants required to complete Back to Work Plan and attend a review after 13 weeks. months, 1996. Underlying these broad brush changes have been numerous detailed shifts set out in Table 6 which have reduced the coverage of the system and increased its operational strictness. The former effect is made clear in Table 7. All these changes have made unemployment a less attractive state than work, which will have had a gradual impact on equilibrium unemployment. married, working spouse married, non-working spouse A small digression is in order here to point out that simply because a change in the benefit system reduces equilibrium unemployment, it does not necessarily imply that it is a good thing. It is arguable, for example, that the current benefit system is simply too mean. In fact, to have a system which operates well, it is not necessary to plunge households into poverty should the sole breadwinner lose his or her job. The system as operated in Denmark, for example, was substantially reformed in the early to mid 1990s, not by reducing the generous level of benefit (replacement rates close to 70 percent of gross earnings) but by providing a system of job search assistance allied to a set of sanctions to be applied if individuals do not fulfil their responsibilities to look for and accept work. These reforms have underpinned the excellent performance of the Danish labour market in recent years (current unemployment around 5 percent). In any event, desirable or otherwise, the overall thrust of changes in the benefit system in the UK have undoubtedly contributed to the fall in equilibrium unemployment reported in Table 1. The role of employment taxes The taxes that are important in the labour market are those which form part of the wedge between the real cost of labour per employee facing firms and the real post-tax consumption wage facing workers. This is important because if any tax which is part of this wedge rises, then either workers get poorer or labour costs go up and employment falls. So, to the extent that workers resist falls in their living standards, employment will fall. The taxes which contribute to this wedge are payroll taxes, income taxes and consumption taxes. There is considerable debate on the extent to which changes in these taxes are absorbed by wage changes or end up impacting on employment (see Nickell and Layard, 1999, for a summary and evidence). The overall conclusion is that a small part of the tax change may impact on employment and this might have helped reduce equilibrium unemployment since the early 1980s because the tax wedge has fallen slightly since that time. The contribution reported in The three factors we have just discussed, wage bargaining, benefits and employment taxes are the main causes of the fall in the equilibrium unemployment rate which underpins the recent benign combination of relatively low unemployment and stable inflation. Furthermore all these changes have come about as a result of policy decisions made prior to 1997. So this naturally leads on to the question of what we might expect to happen to equilibrium unemployment in the future as a result of changes initiated by the Labour Government since 1997. A number of recent policy initiatives have potential implications for the future path of equilibrium unemployment. On wage determination, we have the National Minimum Wage and the new procedure for trade union recognition. On the tax, benefit front there are the New Deals and other policies to improve labour supply as well as the 'tax' effects generated by the additional business costs imposed by new legislation. Finally there are the significant changes in competition policy. Wage determination policy other countries is that for minimum wages set at relatively low levels (such as the UK level), the employment effects are minimal except perhaps for young people in those countries which, unlike Britain, do not have a special low rate for the under 21s. (See Dolado et al. 1996 for a good summary). Despite this Minford and Haldenby (1999) suggest that the NMW will raise equilibrium unemployment by around 0.6 percentage point. However, the evidence we have so far in the UK confirms the international evidence (see Machin et al, 2001) and we should expect no significant impact on equilibrium unemployment from this direction. Minford and Haldenby (1999) also predict a substantial rise in equilibrium unemployment (around 1.2 percentage points) as a result of increased union membership following the new procedure for Trade Union recognition introduced in given the structure of the recognition procedure, it seems likely that increased union membership from this source will be hardly enough to offset losses from closures, derecognitions and retirements (see Metcalf, 2001). So, despite the dire predictions of Minford and Haldenby, it is unlikely that this is going to have any important impact on equilibrium unemployment. Since 1997, UK business has seen a number of new directives, for example, the working time directive, parental leave and part-timers rights. These, de facto, impose additional labour costs on firms. What typically happens is that, over the long-term, wages adjust to compensate and the employment effects are minimal. That is, the workings of the labour market ensure that the employees end up paying for their new benefits in the form of lower wages, a fact which is worth bearing in mind by those press for further extensions of ""employee rights"". So while there are likely to be some negative employment effects as a result of these new employment rights in the short-run, over the longer term, the impact on equilibrium unemployment will probably be negligible. The other important change introduced since 1997 in this context has been the New Deal policies, one of the implications of which is the enhancement of labour supply in the target groups. We shall look at the consequences of New Deal policies in more detail in what follows but, at this stage, all we need say is that, on the basis of the evidence so far, these policies have had a small positive impact on employment. So, over the longer term, we expect them to lead to a small reduction in equilibrium unemployment. In a world where wages are determined by bargaining, increases in product market competition will tend to reduce equilibrium unemployment and raise the share of labour in total output. Many have argued that there has been a significant rise in competition in the UK over the last 20 years and most businessmen would agree. Forces pushing in this direction include privatisation, deregulation and declining trade barriers both within Europe and in the World at large. On the other hand, these same forces have also generated a great deal of ""restructuring"" in many of the affected sectors which has, in most cases, had the effect of sustaining and even concentrating market power. This has been reinforced by the fact that, by comparison with the United States, UK competition law has been relatively feeble. However, the UK anti-trust system was significantly strengthened from 1 into force. This, along with further prospective tightening as a result of future planned changes in competition law, should lead to some reduction in equilibrium unemployment in the longer term. Overall, therefore, recent policy changes are likely to induce only small changes in equilibrium unemployment over the long run. On balance the sort of policy reforms which would be most likely to induce significant reductions in equilibrium unemployment are further shifts in the benefit regime in the direction taken in Denmark which we described earlier. This completes our analysis of the macroeconomics of the labour market and we now turn to some of the important compositional changes which underlie the benign aggregate picture. As we have already noted, if we look at the traditional macroeconomic variables such as unemployment and inflation, the recent picture looks particularly cheerful. But the unemployed are not the only people not working. The other group of non-workers is the inactive who consist of those who are neither working nor looking for work. This is because they are either in full-time education or they are sick and disabled or they have retired early or they are looking after other family members. Before considering the inactive in more detail, it is important to recognise that they are not as cut off from the labour market as the name suggests. Overall, some 4 percent of non-student inactive individuals actually get jobs every quarter . This compares with around 23 percent of the unemployed and 15 percent of inactive students. So the inactive are a source of potential labour supply but they are very different from the explicitly job- seeking unemployed. The first important point to note is that while the unemployment rate has declined substantially since the mid 1980s, the (non-student) inactivity rate has barely changed for 25 years as we can see in Table 8. But underlying this extraordinary stability is a dramatic contrast between men and women. Since 1975, the percentage of non- student men of working age who are inactive has risen by more than 5 times, around a 10 percentage point increase. By contrast, this is almost offset by a nearly 10 percentage point decline in the inactivity rate of women. This latter is simply part of the overall story of women improving their labour market position relative to men in terms of both employment and wages. This is a long process of catch- up which has been going on for over 25 years although it is by no means complete. Our focus here, however, is not on gender imbalances but on those by skill which have been worsening systematically over the last 20 years, particularly among men.  The inactivity rate refers hers to the total number of individuals of working age who are not students and who are neither working nor unemployed, as a proportion of the non-student population of working age. Imbalances by skill: the relative decline of the unskilled Since 1980, those with no qualifications, now around a quarter of the population of working age, have seen substantial falls in their pay relative to those who have obtained some educational qualification. For example, in 1980, men with degrees earned around 63 percent more than those without qualifications, ceteris paribus. By the mid 1990s this had risen to 93 percent. This, despite the fact that the percentage of employees with degrees had almost doubled over the same period (see Machin, employment position of the unskilled has seriously deteriorated as we can see in Tables 9 and 10. The startling feature of these data is that while the unemployment position of those with no qualifications has worsened somewhat, the inactivity rates of this group have risen dramatically, particularly for men. Most extraordinary is the fact that the inactivity rate among men of working age without qualifications was 30 percent in 2000 compared with less than 4 percent some 20 years before. This despite the fact that in 2000, the UK labour market was booming. Overall, this dramatic shift in favour of skilled workers has come about because there has been a significant increase in the relative demand for skilled workers relative to the rise in their relative supply as educational standards improve. The relative demand increase has come about partly because of the bias of technical change in favour of the skilled and partly because changes in the pattern of international trade have favoured skilled workers in the developed countries (see, for example, Berman et al. 1998 and Wood, 1994). But the fundamental issue is the mechanism by which these shifts in supply and demand have generated such dramatic changes in the level of inactivity. In order to pursue this, we must investigate precisely why people are inactive. Inactivity rates among the unskilled In Table 11, we set out the reasons for inactivity in 1998. The key factor, perhaps surprisingly, is that the majority of inactive men are in this situation because of sickness and disability so we would expect to see significant increases in inactivity rates due to sickness and disability and this is confirmed numbers are remarkable. In 1979, only 3.1 percent of prime age (25-54) men with no qualifications were inactive because of sickness and disability. By 1990, this had risen to 6.9 percent, by 1996 to 14.8 percent and today it is over 17 percent. For older men, the numbers are, of course, significantly higher. So how has this come about? There seems no question that some individuals who were hard to place in work were advised by the Employment Service to claim with the fact that inactivity rates for men are significantly higher in high unemployment regions than in low unemployment regions, particularly for those with low skills (see Table 13). So with regard to unskilled men, the situation by the late 1990s may be summarised as follows. A huge decline in the relative demand for unskilled workers has outstripped the fall in their relative supply. This has led directly to significant falls in their relative pay and very large increases in their unemployment, inactivity, and sickness and disability rates. Furthermore, this has helped to create large differences between localities. Any area which has a high proportion of low skill workers can be expected to have high unemployment, high inactivity, high rates of disability and low average earnings for this reason alone. Of course, these disadvantages will then tend to interact with other local social and economic conditions to make the situation worse . This, then, is the state of affairs. So what have been the recent policy responses? The fundamental problem is that there is a large body of individuals of working age who, because of lack of skills, do not command a high enough wage in the labour market to provide a decent standard of living for themselves and their dependents. And this problem is particularly severe in Britain because the pool of very low skill workers in larger than in the typical European country . The obvious long-run policy is to provide every citizen with enough marketable skill to enable them to earn a decent wage in the labour market. There is, of course, a small group of individuals for whom this is not possible. For the remainder, however, it is possible and it is a matter of developing an education and training system that does it. This is a key part of the strategy of the present government and for an analysis of how it is getting on, see Glennerster (2001). Whatever the success in this area, however, this strategy is not going to resolve the problems posed in the foreseeable future. In the meantime, the strategy since 1997 has been simultaneously to encourage work and to provide additional resources to low skill workers. The mechanism is two pronged - to provide assistance in getting into work (e.g. the New Deals) and to increase the rewards for working (e.g. the NMW, the Working Families Tax Credit (WFTC)). Overall, these policies have not, so far, had a big impact on labour supply and employment but they have had a significant impact in terms of providing extra resources to the low paid (essentially the unskilled). Furthermore, they have done this without encouraging them to withdraw from work. Let us consider these policies in more detail. The basic idea of the New Deal policies is to provide resources to assist members of a variety of targeted groups into work. These groups include young people (18-24) who have been out of work for 6 months, adults (25-59) who have been out of work for two years, over 50s who have been on any benefit for 6 months, the disabled and lone parents. The first two are compulsory and members of these groups must enter the relevant programme. The detailed programmes are different for each group but there is typically an initial period where a personal strategy is worked out for each individual which leads on to some form of training, job search assistance, subsidised employment and so on. Most of the programmes have not been operating for very long and there are a variety of pilot schemes and experiments. So, at this stage, it is not possible to obtain a clear view of their consequences. However, the New Deal for young people was the first into operation, starting in January 1998 and here we are in a position to draw some conclusions. The New Deal for young people is open to those aged 18-24 who have been claiming unemployment benefit continuously for 6 months. At this point participation is mandatory in the sense that benefit payments cease if the young person does not participate. Those joining first enter a Gateway period lasting up to four months, during which the Employment Service will work with them to improve their employability and to find unsubsidised jobs. Those who do not find a job will then move onto one of four options lasting for six months: (i) a period of subsidised employment (PS60 p.w. subsidy), (ii) a course of education or training last, on average, 9 month","['labour', 'unemployment', 'unemployed', 'employment', 'macroeconomics']","['macroeconomics labour', 'labour market', 'british unemployment', 'unemployment uk', 'inflation unemployment']","['uk labour market', 'labour market suggests', 'macroeconomics labour market', 'labour market macroeconomic', 'improving labour market']"
5267,r081122a_BOE,united kingdom,2008-11-22,Some Lessons for Monetary Policy from the Recent Financial Turmoil,bean,0,"The present financial crisis has many parents, encompassing both market failures and supervisory shortcomings. A non-exhaustive list would include: inadequate incentives for care in the origination of loans if the risks are to be passed on; extreme opacity in the nature of the risks underlying complex structured finance assets; too much reliance on statistical models of risk based on past behaviour; disproportionate dependence on ratings by end-investors and a failure to observe due diligence; excessive closeness of the ratings agencies to those who were issuing debt; compensation schemes in financial institutions that encouraged excessive risk-taking and a focus on short-term returns; a failure by originating banks to realise the extent to which distributed risks could return to them; excessive reliance on short-term wholesale funding and inadequate attention to the potential liquidity of assets; and a failure by regulatory and supervisory authorities to appreciate fully the risks inherent in the 'originate-to-distribute' model. The ongoing work of the Financial Stability Forum and G20 to address these and related issues and to strengthen the financial system against any future repeat is, of course, extremely welcome. But these are just the collective match that ignited the conflagration. You need fuel to make a fire too. And that was provided by the ex-ante excess supply of global savings over investment, which pushed real interest rates on safe assets to historically low levels, reinforced by loose monetary policy. That in turn encouraged a 'search for yield' and a compression of risk premia as financial institutions sought returns high enough to meet end-investors' unchanged expectations. Moreover, higher asset prices raised the net worth of financial companies, allowing more borrowing and further compressing yields. This 'savings glut', as Chairman Ben Bernanke christened it, was in part the result of high national savings rates in some Asian emerging economies, especially China, which despite high investment rates, chose to export capital rather than import it, as standard theory would lead one to expect. High savings rates in Japan for demographic reasons and, latterly, also by some of the major oil producers further boosted the supply of global savings. One factor behind the high level of savings by the emerging market economies was their experience during the 1997-8 Asia crisis, when several countries were forced to tighten policy sharply in the face of a 'sudden stop' of capital inflows from abroad. Thereafter, a strategy of relying on domestic savings to finance investment and the accumulation of a substantial war chest of foreign reserves looked more appealing. Another was the lack of an adequate social welfare net that encouraged high levels of precautionary savings by households. On top of this, global monetary conditions were relatively easy for much of the past decade. In the United States, monetary policy was relaxed aggressively during the ICT-led downturn that started in 2001. With growing concerns about the possibility of deflation, policy was deliberately kept loose until mid-2004, even though the economy had begun to recover earlier. For instance, John Taylor has calculated that applying his eponymous Taylor Rule in mid-2004 would have pointed to a Federal Funds rate as much as 300 basis points higher. And even once the monetary stimulus was withdrawn, it was carried out at a 'measured pace'. Because a number of countries, most obviously China, chose to peg their currencies either to the dollar or to a basket in which the dollar featured heavily, the FOMC had to cut rates more aggressively to maintain domestic activity than would have been the case if the dollar had been free to depreciate against them. Moreover, by virtue of the currency pegs, this monetary looseness in the United States was transmitted overseas, despite attempts at sterilisation. Now the primary driver behind the surge in commodity prices over the past three years or so has been the rapid development of the emerging market economies and the consequent growth in commodity demand running up against relatively inelastic supply. But the general pickup in inflation worldwide, together with the appreciation of a range of asset prices, suggests that accommodative monetary policies may have also played a part. The pattern of global imbalances that resulted from this mix of policies has vexed policymakers for some time. We knew they were unsustainable and worried that the unwinding might be disorderly, though I don't think anyone could have guessed the course that events would actually take. But we did see that there were vulnerabilities present. However, nothing very much was done about these imbalances. Why was In my view, it is a mistake to point the finger at any individual country's choice of policies. Given historical experience and the desire to facilitate rapid development, the Chinese strategy of export-led growth and high savings, facilitated by a weak renminbi, seems entirely rational. But that meant the rest of the world, and in particular the United States, needed to be willing to run a substantial current account deficit and capital account surplus if overall macroeconomic balance was to be maintained. Likewise, the Fed's desire to keep long-term interest rates low so as to counter the threat of deflation in the wake of the sharp slowdown in growth in the early years of this decade was understandable. But the net effect of these policies that were sensible from a national perspective was to generate an equilibrium for the world economy in which there was an ample supply of cheap funds looking for a suitable home. That home turned out to be mainly the housing market in a number of the advanced economies, particularly the United States as well as the United Kingdom. A lesson from this episode is that the pursuit of rational policies from a national perspective need not result in a satisfactory overall equilibrium. Of course, it was precisely this realisation that drove Keynes' vision of the post-war economic order. With reform of the international financial institutions on the agenda once more, now is the time to start thinking again how we can better guide the choice and operation of national policy and regulatory frameworks so that they result in a coherent and sustainable outcome for the world as a whole, not just at the national level. The IMF, for example, could usefully increase its focus on the mutual sustainability of national policy frameworks, analyse in more depth how policy actions within them interact internationally and identify those that are likely lead to unsatisfactory or unsustainable global outcomes. Ideally, the international community ought then to be in a position to prevent the adoption of such frameworks, though I recognise that translating this into concrete action is a difficult task. One of the key challenges is that policy makers need to recognise that acting collectively will be in their own national interest. But then the same could have been said about the difficulty of promoting free trade and preventing protectionism before the foundation of the GATT/WTO. In any case, unless we grasp this nettle, the world economy may continue to be prone to the build-up of financial imbalances and their subsequent disorderly unwind. The G20 has an important role in taking this forward, with all of the right countries present around the table. Let me now leave the global imbalances and policy externalities to one side and address a second issue: what role should monetary policy play in restraining an asset- price boom driven by excessive credit expansion? As I noted earlier, an abundance of liquidity was probably a contributory - though in my view not the primary - factor behind the decline in global real interest rates, the build-up of leverage in the financial system and the consequent asset-price boom. Yet this took place when central banks in the advanced economies were (fairly successfully) pursuing monetary policies in which price stability was a central objective, either as the primary objective as in the case of the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, or as part of a dual mandate in the case of the US Federal Reserve. Could we - and should we - have used monetary policy more actively to counter the build-up of credit and the associated increase in house and other asset prices? One view, long advanced by Bill White and his colleagues at the Bank for , is that an exclusive focus on the stability of the prices of goods and services is conducive to a build-up of financial imbalances and associated asset price boom-busts. In the past, excessive credit growth tended to generate a pickup in inflation, necessitating a subsequent tightening in monetary policy, which in turn dampened both credit growth and inflation. But the success of inflation targeting and similar monetary frameworks in anchoring inflation expectations have flattened the short-run Phillips curve trade-off and attenuated the inflationary impact of excessive credit growth, so lessening the pressure on the central bank to tighten policy. Moreover, in many of the advanced economies that experienced credit and housing booms, demand expansion was not unduly rapid: for instance, the average rate of growth of UK final domestic demand over the 2004-7 period was just 2 3/4 %. Now the unwinding of financial imbalances has often proved costly in the past in terms of lost output and increased unemployment. For instance, although there is a wide range of national experiences, Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff find that post- war financial crises in the advanced economies have, on average, been associated with a drop in real per capita growth of over two per cent and that it typically takes two years to return to trend; for the most catastrophic cases, the drop in growth was as much as five percentage points. Relatedly, the latest IMF contains analysis suggesting that downturns that are preceded by financial stress are on average associated with cumulative output losses about two percentage points higher than those that are not. Given the potential costs of a bust, it would therefore appear to be wise to use monetary policy to try to prevent the build-up of the imbalances in the first place. Note that this is not going so far as to advocate targeting asset prices. That would place the burden of adjustment to real shocks - such as an improvement in productivity which should raise real equity prices, or an increase in population which should raise real house prices - on to the less flexible prices of goods and services rather than the highly flexible asset price. That cannot make sense. But it does at least justify 'leaning against the wind' during the upswing phase of a credit/asset- price boom in order to moderate the boom and thus also the prospective fallout from any subsequent bust. Steve Cecchetti and others have advocated just such an approach. Previously, I have argued that a suitably flexible inflation targeting regime already provides the scope to take on board such concerns about the risks associated with excessive credit growth. For instance, the remit to the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee allows us to deviate from the inflation target in the near term, if by doing so it would enhance our chances of meeting it further out. A sharp contraction associated with the unwinding of a credit boom increases the likelihood of undershooting the target. So a near-term undershoot during the boom phase may, in principle, be warranted. Indeed, a central bank seeking to stabilize inflation over a sufficiently long time horizon should necessarily recognize the possible adverse long- term consequences of a credit-driven asset-price boom in its policy deliberations. While the argument that central banks should factor in the long-term implications for output, and thus also inflation, of credit/asset-price boom-busts is persuasive, there are practical difficulties in pursuing a 'leaning against the wind' policy. These include the need to decide whether an asset price increase is warranted or whether it is based on misplaced expectations and poses a threat to future macroeconomic stability and the possibility that a rate increase might trigger exactly the bust one is worried about. But then central banks are called on to make difficult judgements all the time. In my view, the most important qualification is simply that a modest increase in the official interest rate is unlikely to do much to restrain a credit/asset-price boom that is in full swing. It is simply not credible to believe that the UK house-price boom that is now unwinding would never have happened if only the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee had set official interest rates just a little bit higher. But an increase large enough to have had a material effect would have also depressed activity significantly. I doubt that people would be prepared to accept the clear short-term costs of such a strategy in return for the uncertain long-term benefits. Moreover, with low global real interest rates and abundant global liquidity, the effectiveness of monetary tightening by the Monetary Policy Committee alone in restraining credit growth would have been severely diluted. Co-ordinated action would have been necessary, which links back to my earlier theme. The problem here is that the central bank is trying to achieve two objectives - price stability and the avoidance of unsustainable financial imbalances - with just one instrument, the official policy rate. So ideally one wants to call on another instrument, preferably one targeted at the market failure driving the excessive credit boom. Now confidence in the banking system is a public good, but the management and shareholders of banks do not have the incentive to internalise this fully. And the risk and potential cost of a harmful collapse increases as debt and leverage build up. The obvious way to address this problem is by requiring banks to raise extra buffers of capital or to put aside additional reserves during the boom phase of the credit cycle, which can then be called upon if the credit cycle turns. The Spanish approach of dynamic provisioning represents a particular application of this general idea. There, banks are required to build up a general reserve equal to the difference between an estimate of long-term losses and specific provisions on currently impaired assets. But there are a variety of other ways one might go about setting up such a scheme. An alternative - or complementary - approach, due to Anil , is to get banks to purchase private capital insurance from a suitable 'deep pocket', such as a sovereign wealth fund, that pays out if aggregate financial conditions deteriorate sufficiently. In essence, the recent injection of additional capital into the banking systems of a number of countries, including in the United Kingdom, can be thought of as mimicking what would have happened with such a pro-cyclical capital requirement. Under such a regime, banks would have been required to raise extra capital during the boom phase, which would also have reduced the rate of credit expansion. Then during the bust phase, minimum capital requirements would be reduced, leaving the banks with a buffer of excess capital. That in turn would reduce the need for rapid de- leveraging and moderate any cut-back in lending. That is what the injection of extra capital is designed to achieve. There is much work still to do on the design of such macro-prudential regulation. In particular, there is a range of bank-specific and macroeconomic indicators that could be used as the key and the right balance between automaticity and discretion in application needs to be struck. But it has the virtue of addressing the market failure directly, rather than indirectly through monetary policy. Had such a regime been in force over the past decade, I believe that it could have significantly eased our present troubles. In conclusion, while lax global monetary policy probably played some part in the credit build-up that is now painfully unwinding, it was only one of many parents. And it is unrealistic to think that interest rates high enough to prevent that build-up would not also have had a major depressing effect on activity. I think the real lesson is that, alongside the many other regulatory improvements now under consideration, we need a regulatory regime that works against the natural cyclical excesses of the credit cycle. That would leave monetary policy free to be directed at where its comparative advantage lies, namely achieving overall price stability.","['crises', 'risk', 'banking', 'finance', 'crisis']","['financial crises', 'financial crisis', 'financial stability', 'loans risks', 'financial conditions']","['present financial crisis', 'financial crises advanced', 'market failures supervisory', 'war financial crises', 'issues strengthen financial']"
5393,r110523a_BOE,united kingdom,2011-05-23,Building resilient financial systems: macroprudential regimes and securities market regulation,tucker,0,"Thank you very much indeed for inviting me to join you today. I am especially grateful as it gives me an opportunity to air some thoughts about how the regulation of our securities markets fits into the development of macroprudential regimes for preserving stability in the future. In a debate often dominated by concerns about banks, the vital importance of resilient and effective capital markets is easily neglected. This is not at all to diminish the vital lessons from the crisis for banking supervisors around the world, many of whom had lost their traditional system-oriented perspective. But the rules of the game set by securities regulators provide a framework for the functioning of markets that is as important to the operation of the financial system as the regime for banks. This is especially important for the UK authorities because London hosts the most international capital markets and yet the City is not a hermetically sealed entrepot. It is bolted into our real economy. And it is especially important for the Bank of England as we establish the new Financial Policy Committee, the UK's new macroprudential committee. But my remarks today are a contribution to the international reform agenda rather than for the UK specifically. The importance of capital markets I am guided by my working definition of financial stability. That is that financial stability prevails where the financial system is sufficiently resilient that worries about bad states of the world do not undermine confidence in the ability of the system to deliver its core services to the rest of the economy . As the Bank has set out in its strategy for financial stability , the core services are the transfer of payments; the provision of credit and equity; and risk transfer or insurance. It is obvious that the resilience of firms matters hugely. But that cannot be all. Firms are linked by markets and infrastructure though a network of contracts covering derivatives; repos and securities lending; correspondent banking, clearing and prime brokerage services etc. Moreover, some markets bring end users together. A financial-stability policy regime that focused solely on the financial soundness of a few firms would, therefore, be myopic. But while nearly all markets are subject to regulation, relatively little thought has been given over the past decade to how different markets matter to stability and, hence, about the role of the authorities in this area.  Markets matter to stability in different ways As a provisional attempt at this, I think it might be helpful to distinguish between three types of market: infrastructural markets, intra-financial-system markets, and end-user markets. The first type is those markets that provide essential, quasi-infrastructural support to banking. The obvious example is the overnight wholesale money markets. They are effectively part of the payments system infrastructure. Banking, which is integral to the provision of all three core financial services, simply could not operate without these markets. They have long been, and will remain, of concern to central banks. I will not return to them today. The second category is intra-financial system markets (a slightly broader concept than inter-dealer markets). These markets determine the interlinkages amongst financial firms. They matter because banks, dealers and funds rely on them in order to provide services to the rest of the economy, and also because they can increase fragilities in the system. They are perhaps represented best by what have become known as the 'financing markets': repo, securities lending, certificates of deposit etc - the markets that financial firms use to access short-term wholesale funding. The authorities' engagement with them is, frankly, patchy. At one end of the spectrum, central bankers in particular have a good track record of ensuring the professionalism of core government-bond repo markets. That was not without good cause. When the US Treasury repo markets started in the mid-to-late 1970s, there was a string of scandals . When the UK authorities opened up the way to a gilt repo market in the early-90s, therefore, we worked with the industry on the supporting hard and soft infrastructure, including a Code drawn up by the Stock Lending and Repo Committee, to avoid a repetition in London of Wall Street's experience. It would be hard for the authorities to claim the same foresight concerning the wider securities lending or repo markets in recent years. The employment by securities lenders of cash collateral became a core but hugely opaque financing market in the run up to the latest crisis . The run on repo, documented by Gary Gorton , was how the US securities dealers unravelled. The authorities need to develop policies for monitoring and, where necessary, controlling these markets for providing leverage and maturity transformation. I believe that central banks can play a special role in this area. Important 'intra-financial system markets' are not restricted to banking. The reinsurance markets, and the mechanisms for sharing risks in Lloyd's of London, are other examples. As are the inter-dealer markets in derivatives, which have traditionally employed different protocols (notably collateralisation, under Credit-Support  Annexes) than get used in transactions with end users. Away from banks, these Over the Counter derivative markets have been the principal focus of policy. They are being rethought, under a mandate from the G20 . The third category of markets is those that matter directly in their own right to end users. Notably the primary markets in equity and debt. These markets and the associated secondary markets often rely on 'market makers' for liquidity, but they are not the marginal source of financing or risk management for banks and dealers. In the past, they have often been distant from the attention of the financial stability authorities, but their integrity has long been a focus for securities regulators. They are especially important in economies where a significant proportion of the intermediation of savings/investment occurs via capital markets rather than via bank balance sheets. If those core capital markets are not resilient to shocks and, crucially, if substitutes are not readily available, disruptions could materially impair the supply of credit and risk-capital to the economy, with macroeconomic and other welfare costs. Equity and high-grade corporate bond markets probably pass that test in a number of developed economies. In the USA at least, some securitisation markets were probably significant too. When the securitisation markets closed, they had become so big in the USA that it was not realistic for that part of the credit system to be reintermediated by the US banking system in short order. Even if the banks had been strong, they would have needed to raise a lot more capital to expand their balance sheets. It is, of course, natural that policy has focused on those markets - securitisation and some OTC derivatives - that featured prominently in the crisis. But we do need to develop a framework for identifying more generally which markets really matter to stability. That means being attentive to exchange-traded derivatives and to cash markets, whether on or off-exchange, and perhaps especially to the short-term financing markets. Where firms are concerned, we have learned to focus on maturity transformation and leverage. For markets, it is, perhaps, not quite so straightforward. In the case of intra-financial system markets, we are interested in whether they produce chains of cumulative maturity transformation and leverage, and how transparent that is. With end- user markets, we are also interested in whether they are driven by strongly procyclical forces; whether they are especially liable to generate assets whose risks are mispriced or obscure; whether demand is dominated by leveraged investors and traders. We are interested in whether they can crater - becoming illiquid or even closing - under stress. And in whether there are ready substitutes. If not, intermediation can become impeded and end-users deprived of valuable services. Across all of these concerns, the underlying factors may be either structural or cyclical. And they go wider than the traditional focus of securities regulators on the integrity of transactions in public 'end user' markets. In practice, the components of individual markets give us a list of things to focus on. A list that goes well beyond firms: products and their distribution in primary markets; the rules of the game and infrastructure for trading,  including the role of market makers; the infrastructure for post-trade clearing and settlement; and asset management practices. Especially for 'end-user markets', these are subjects typically associated with securities market regulation not with mainstream microprudential supervision. I want to bring out that they are, nevertheless, integral to financial stability authorities. Under each of those headings, I shall raise a few points that have not featured prominently in recent debates. To be clear, I shall not attempt to cover all important markets. And I shall not address important questions about the role of securities regulators in crisis management, circuit-breakers, or counter-cyclical policies such as varying minimum margin requirements as conditions change. Moreover, I must stress that I speak only for myself. The issuance and distribution of securities Toxic ABS and CDOs - cash as well as 'synthetic' or derivative versions - were at the centre of the crisis. They were not toxic for the financial system because they were risky or, indeed, because many underlying household and business borrowers became overindebted. Markets can price (and ration) risk they comprehend (if appropriate requiring yields that inhibit issuance). They were toxic because they were mispriced; and they were mispriced in part because they were misunderstood. Through the consequent enticements to leverage, that misunderstanding engulfed banks, asset managers, credit insurers and, eventually, the authorities. Both dealer-financing markets and end-user markets closed. Listing authorities and securities regulation And yet all of those securities were issued and/or distributed under the securities laws and policies of developed countries or financial centres with elaborate securities market regulation. Prospectuses or other documentation had to meet regulatory or listing requirements. Those requirements were meant to be exacting if the securities were issued onto the public markets. In Europe, it seems most issuers of ABS and CDOs chose to list them in Ireland or Luxembourg. In many jurisdictions, including the USA, the requirements were deliberately less exacting if the securities were distributed solely via the 'private markets' to wholesale or sophisticated investors. This prompts two thoughts. First, with hindsight, could Listing Authorities and securities regulators do more in the future to ensure that the disclosure around complex securities are comprehensible, coherent and, crucially, simple and short enough to be capable of being absorbed? And should Listing Authorities be more willing to step in and require changes to the structure of complex securities where they conclude that the disclosure is inadequate and just cannot realistically  be made adequate? Have 'risk factors' become so numerous, wordy and wide-ranging that they lose their impact? In their understandable desire to avoid validating products and securities, have securities regulators retreated too far towards simply checking that the required boxes have been ticked? Perhaps I am imagining it, but I recollect a period in which Listing Authorities were guardians of the integrity of primary markets. That over time came to rely upon disclosure. And that ended up meaning accepting documents that were comprehensive rather than comprehensible. Where something is incomprehensible, and has reached a scale where it could even jeopardise stability, the relevant authority should say so. Where it can be made comprehensible via a succinct piece of analysis in the introduction of a Prospectus, the Authority could require that. What I am suggesting would entail Listing Authorities and securities regulators more generally thinking about themselves somewhat differently and, if I may say so, being somewhat less bound by the traditions of public equity markets. This seems unavoidable given the growth in private offerings of complex securities and the involvement of banks in securities-market intermediation. It might require legislation in some jurisdictions to entitle securities regulators to take into account financial stability . Prior to the crisis, that had hardly been debated anywhere, but IOSCO's principles of securities regulation have recently been revised to identify reducing systemic risk as one of the three objectives of securities regulation. That innovation is big, but it needs to be incorporated into national regimes and practices. Second, is it always right to make a clear distinction between laws and rules governing 'public' issues and private placements? Viewed against the historical objectives of securities regulation - fairness, transparency, and investor protection - the public market v. private-transaction distinction does indeed seem valid. But we need to debate whether the separation is so neat when the public policy objective of financial stability is taken into account. That is because the creation and private placement of very large amounts of particular types of security can affect the amount of risk being borne by the system as a whole in ways that are opaque to everyone. For example, in the USA, as the SEC has commented, a lot of structured-finance products, including pretty well all CDOs and Asset-Backed CP, were issued privately and so were exempt from a panoply of disclosure requirements that apply to 'registered' offerings. Reducing that opacity, and ensuring the integrity of these market mechanisms, could well be in the interests of investors in private placements themselves. This issue is not easy. On the one hand, it is reasonable for the regulatory regime to make allowance for private transactions amongst 'consenting adults'. And the issuance of small amounts of any type of security cannot possibly jeopardise stability. On the other hand, it is reasonable for public policy regimes to address the externalities - in this case, the potential systemic effects - of thousands of large private transactions that take place away from public markets. My concern is not that sophisticated investors cannot fend for themselves. And I do not want to deny that private transactions can aid stability, as indeed has been the case with much recent private-market debt issuance by banks. But nobody can assess the risks they are incurring in some transactions  without much more information about the totality of risks out there and the network of exposures within the financial system. At the least, good aggregate information is needed about patterns of issuance in private markets. Product gatekeepers: securities regulators These questions of how securities regulators should respond to the possible effects of innovations on the stability of the system are not limited to their listing-authority function. The rules for collective-investment schemes matter too. A good example, highlighted recently by the G20 Financial Stability Board, is the development of the Exchange-Traded Fund markets to include synthetic structures, leveraged funds, less liquid underlyings, and all three combined. Remind you of how securitisations ended up in CDO2 and CPDOs? In the EU, ETFs are subject to the UCITs rules for what are in effect mutual funds available to retail investors. Securities regulators need to think about how to avoid mechanically applying a regime for vanilla investment schemes to the structuring and distribution of much more complex and sophisticated products. In the same spirit, recent ETFs innovations underline the need for securities regulators to work closely with bank supervisors and macroprudential authorities on shadow banking and what I earlier called 'financing markets'. For both physical and synthetic funds, the underlying collateral pools are being swapped to provide financing for dealers and banks. It is not clear whether bank supervisors have caught up with this, or whether the risk of the collateral swaps being called is treated appropriately in regulatory maturity-mismatch ladders. Who would have guessed that vanilla collective investment schemes, could be turned to this purpose? The truth is that any pool of assets can be. While the FSB has already called for authorities to act to keep the evolution of ETFs on a sustainable path, the broader lesson is that securities regulators need to be alive to the need to keep up with innovations and, like bank supervisors, they need to be ready to accept an occasional steer from macroprudential authorities. It would be hard to talk about the issue and distribution of securities without mentioning Credit Rating Agencies. It is important to reduce the significance of CRA ratings in our capital markets. Pervasive mechanistic reliance on  ratings is by no means mainly the fault of the Rating Agencies themselves or of financial firms, although many of the latter have acted - and probably continue to act - foolishly. The extent to which ratings have been bolted into regulatory regimes - by securities regulators and prudential supervisors - has plainly been a great mistake. And it is one of those mistakes whose effects have become so woven into the fabric of 'modern' finance that it is going to take an extraordinary act of will (and patience) to undo it. Yes, we do have asset managers (and banks) who might not be able to evaluate some securities on their own if they were not permitted, by official regimes, to rely on CRA ratings. But what on earth are we doing not only tolerating but effectively encouraging a financial system in which asset managers and banks can't always understand their portfolios? It is therefore vital that, together with the Basel Supervisors Committee, securities regulators around the world actively implement the FSB's Principles for reducing mechanistic reliance on CRA ratings. In the US, the SEC is embarked on that. But I worry that others, including prudential supervisors, might not grapple with this admittedly difficult exercise in a determined way. The enhanced (meaning better not longer) disclosure by issuers I discussed earlier could make the standard-setters' task somewhat less difficult. One of the wonderful things about capitalism is innovation. It helps to drive technical progress and higher-living standards. Open economies allow those innovations to spread across the world. Freely flowing capital is essential for this to work in my view. But innovations can take a nasty turn in financial markets when they outgrow their supporting infrastructure. This is an area where the authorities can do good, because there is often a collective action problem. For example, the recent crisis would have been much worse if the authorities, led by the New York Fed, had not 'asked' the dealer and fund community to clean up the problem of assignments in credit-default-swap markets in the early years of the last decade. But we need to remember to be ready to step in. The OTC derivative markets are an example where the authorities have had to chase after events. The cash ABS markets are another, with central banks now taking a lead by introducing standards for transparency and the structure of the securities we are prepared to take as collateral. Trading platforms and exchanges Currently, a key area of reform is the infrastructure for the main over-the-counter derivative markets. In the trading area, there is a debate about how far to unravel the predominantly bilateral mechanics of OTC derivatives markets and how far to move towards exchanges. Perhaps to different degrees in the US and the EU,  there is an unresolved issue about whether all standardized derivative products should be traded via Multi-Dealer Platforms, which are a bit like exchanges, or whether to allow Single-Dealer Platforms through which a broker-dealer sets up its own quasi-exchange. A preliminary study by IOSCO did not reach a clear conclusion given the dispersion of views. I want to inject one thought from a financial stability perspective into this debate. So far as we can see, the debate has been cast pretty much entirely in terms of market integrity (honesty and fairness), transparency and the efficiency of price discovery - the core concerns of a securities regulator. The missing word is 'liquidity'. And the question is whether or not liquidity would be more resilient under stress depending on whether an asset class was traded on MDPs or SDPs. The question of resilient liquidity matters enormously. As the crisis in 2007 reminded everyone, the liquidity of markets can evaporate, causing liquidity premia to soar, undermining the net worth of those intermediaries and investors who mark to market, feeding back into market dynamics in a vicious circle. As well as controlling leverage, prudential standard setters can help here by ensuring that bank and dealer intermediaries carry capital to cover the risk of swings in liquidity premia and against the pervasive basis risk warehoused by 'market makers' in illiquid or non-standard products. The Basel Supervisors Committee is working on that in its Fundamental But, surely, the design of the market microstructure also matters. In that sphere, might the choice between MDPs and SDPs also make a difference? It is hard to know. There is some evidence from the fx markets that, during the crisis, volumes shifted to single-dealer platforms. One possible explanation for that would be the incentive of individual firms to make clear to their customers that they provided a liquidity service during thick and thin, expecting to be rewarded with more business as normality returns. But I must stress that I do not have a position on this. Rather, my point is that this very important issue has been debated without the liquidity dimension being explicitly considered. Following discussion at FSB, that gap in the analysis is now being addressed by the IOSCO leadership. Post-trade infrastructure: CCPs as risk managers The other big area of reform is, of course, around central counterparties. Clearing more OTC products; being more resilient; revisiting criteria for access to CCPs, and so on. You don't need me to rehearse all of that for you. But I would note that this is not just about derivatives markets. LCH's move to clear repos in Spanish government bonds helped that market stay open during some dark days. And I do want to make one very important general point about the role of CCPs and their management.  CCPs simplify the complex web of counterparty exposures through multilateral netting - precisely what the US authorities contemplated trying to achieve ad hoc towards the end of a weekend when Lehman was unravelling. They act as a central market authority for valuing positions and setting minimum margin levels. Having centralised risk upon themselves, they redistribute it to their clearing members through a clear waterfall. They are, in effect, systemic risk managers. They absolutely must think of themselves as that. Their job is not just to deliver ever greater operational and capital efficiency for their clearing members. Too many senior executives at CCPs I have met over the past decade or so have seemed to fall into that trap - a trap encouraged by some being for-profit organisations. I fear that what I am saying will seem novel. In fact, this emphasis on their role as systemic risk managers was a clear lesson from the very few instances of clearing houses failing over past decades. ""When everything else is stripped away, the most pressing issue is the management of risk. The focus of this is ......increasingly, the central clearing houses - indeed [their] prudent operation is perhaps the single most important objective for the market authorities and regulators. What does this mean in practice? My personal view is that, amongst other things, it means that CCPs should not outsource their core risk management functions; they should monitor the robustness of their clearing members; and they should monitor risks from the business that their clearing members are bringing to them as an indication of incipient fragility. Amongst other things, that means collecting and analysing information from clearing members on large positions taken by their customers. In 1987, it was the long positions of a trader that bankrupted the Hong Kong clearing house. Some elements of the clearing house regime are clearly for the authorities to determine. One important one, which is implicitly being debated in some jurisdictions but not in a way noticed by anyone other than specialists, is whether clearing houses should adopt what is called Gross Margining rather than Net Margining. What this means is that a clearing member - ie a dealer - could not net off positions of their various customers and their own house position when the amount of margin they have to hold with the clearing house is determined. That would affect the incentives of clearing members to collect minimum margin amounts from their customers. And, more generally, it would probably reduce the amount of leverage in the system and simplify the chain of credit. Again, my point is not at all to advocate a position on this one way or another. It is to note that this is about more than investor protection through the segregation of client moneys, and so needs to be debated against the goal of preserving stability without impairing efficiency.  Post-trade infrastructures: trade repositories Moving on from CCPs, a quick appeal - in fact, two if I may - to the securities regulator community on Trade They are one of the most interesting innovations brought forth by the crisis. They are expected to house information, on a trade-by-trade basis, on the type of contract, notional value, currency, maturity, counterparties of derivative transactions. This needs somehow to extend to valuation(s) and collateral terms. My appeal to the US, EU and Asian authorities is twofold. First, should we not have a Trade Repository covering securities lending - a cash market - including the way collateral is employed? We surely need to do something to lift the veil on this vital financing market and, probably, on the collateral swap market more generally. Second, we need to think carefully about the purposes for which the information in TRs is collected, and thus how it is stored. As well as helping to identify market abuse, which of course is a core mission of securities regulators, we need to use the information to track more generally what is going on in markets to help us spot incipient, often slow-moving threats to stability. And even though individual Trade Repositories are being set up to handle specific markets (credit-default swaps, interest-rate swaps etc), it needs to be possible to see the pattern of risk and flows across markets and products. Recognising that, the FSB has called for the relevant authorities, liaising with the BIS Committee of the Global Financial System, to set requirements for reporting of transactions to trade repositories that meet the needs of financial stability analysis. This work needs a higher profile. Markets are places where end-users and intermediaries meet. Securities regulation affects financial firms - traders and asset managers - as both intermediaries and as users. It is important this gives proper weight to financial stability. Three broad thoughts on that. Regulated banks: provisions and disclosure Everybody in this room and outside knows, or should know, that for much of the past quarter of a century there was a stand off between bank supervisors and securities regulators over provisioning policy. On the one hand, until they gave up in exhaustion, many bank supervisors wanted banks to set aside (general) provisions against losses that were implicit in portfolios but not yet manifest in arrears or other concrete measures of impairment. Today we would call this forward-looking or expected-loss or dynamic provisioning. On the other hand, securities regulators typically opposed this because they feared, no doubt with some reason, that it could be used to smooth  profits in a misleading way. There were some famous stand offs. I do not doubt the sincerity of the securities regulators' concerns. And no-one could ignore the constraints that, as the years passed, were codified into accounting policy. But the stand off across the supervisor/market regulator divide was a problem. Progress is now being made by the IASB and FASB on developing more forward-looking impairment standards. The key to progress was the joint recognition by market regulators and supervisors that earlier identification of credit losses is consistent both with financial statement users' needs for transparency regarding changes in credit trends and with the prudential objective of safety and soundness. In the other direction, bank supervisors have typically insisted on the vital confidentiality of the information they receive, while securities regulators emphasise transparency. One could argue that, in many countries, the bank supervisors have done too well in this debate. That was brought home to me some years ago when, in a previous existence at the Bank of England, my then team realised that we could analyse large and complex firms most easily using disclosures made under SEC rules. As announced last week in the joint Bank of England/FSA document on how the future Prudential Regulation Authority will approach banking supervision, we plan in the future to publish prudential returns to the extent possible. Shadow banking and the prudential perimeter My second point about firms concerns shadow banking, defined to mean non-bank firms or structures that replicate the monetary and/or credit services of banks in some way, involving maturity transformation and/or leverage . In a world in which regulatory arbitrage is endemic, it is a fact of life that the re-regulation of banks will set up incentives to build banking-like functions in other forms. The import of this for my remarks today is that securities market regulators (and insurance regulators) need either to be relaxed about the supervision of shadow banks being transferred to banking supervisors or, alternatively, vigilant about maintaining regimes that do not permit systemic risk to accumulate beyond the perimeter of the banking system. In the UK's planned new regulatory framework, the Financial Policy Committee will be responsible for recommending to the Treasury when prudential supervision of a type of firm should shift from the securities regulator to the prudential regulator (and vice versa); and it will be able to advise the FCA on when it needs to revise its rulebook in the interests of stability. Different jurisdictions will come up with different arrangements to address this issue, but I would say that every jurisdiction is going to need its own solution. And, perhaps for the first time, that has highlighted the need for some international co-ordination of policies on shadow banks. The FSB is just starting to explore this virgin territory.  Asset managers and incentives The vast majority of the asset management world is not engaged in shadow banking and, more important, does not of itself jeopardise the stability of the system directly if it gets into trouble. The taking and absorption of risk by unlevered funds is a fundamentally healthy part of the system. But financial stability authorities cannot be indifferent to this industry. By investing in the debt and equity of banks, it is a vital part of market discipline. We do not want - and cannot have - a system where the first line of defence after the management of banks themselves is the cadre of official sector supervisors. For the system to be healthy, we need boards, auditors, equity investors and debt holders to play a big part, and for investment decisions to be subject to constructive incentives. Yet, there is relatively little debate about whether the incentives of asset managers made the system more prone to crisis. Although not a subject for today, an important part of this is the drive to develop resolution regimes that entail debt holders taking losses on their exposures to distressed banks and dealers.

5446,r120324a_BOE,united kingdom,2012-03-24,Panel discussion on 'Challenges for the Future',king,1,"The dinner last night we shall all remember for a long time. We were fortunate enough to hear three Fed Chairmen - each of them a giant in his own way - and a reply from Don Kohn that was not only insightful and thoughtful, but moving too. Tributes are one thing, but the Bank of England puts its money where its mouth is. Alan Greenspan originally loaned Don Kohn to the Bank, as we couldn't afford the transfer fee. But as soon as Don was out of contract we swooped to sign him for our new Financial Policy Committee (FPC). The respect and affection in which Don is held at the Bank of England is demonstrated by the presence here of three of us from the Bank. So what lessons have Don and we at the Bank drawn from the crisis? Let me relate these to the three topics of the conference - monetary policy, liquidity provision and macro-prudential policy, three of the core functions of central banks. The financial crisis has brought these core functions closer together, highlighting the complementarities as well as blurring the lines between them. The separation of monetary from financial stability policies no longer seems so clear cut, and this new world presents central banks with many challenges. The challenge for monetary policy can most easily be put as follows. Before the financial crisis output growth was around trend in the industrialised world, inflation was low and stable, and yet the balance sheet of the banking sector, and so broad money, expanded at a destabilising pace. In the UK growth averaged 2.9% in the five years to 2007, only marginally above the average growth rate from 1950 to 2002. Nor is there evidence of an output boom in other advanced economies. The IMF estimates of the output gap for the UK, Japan and the US were all small, and that for the euro area saw only a short-lived pick-up in 2006-7. Consistent with the steady growth of output, inflation was low and stable: indeed UK inflation did not stray more than one percentage point from target for nearly 15 years until Yet we saw persistent global imbalances and a build up of leverage that led to the financial crisis. In the UK, the largest banks' balance sheets grew by an average of nearly 25% a year from 2002 to 2007. UK banks tripled in size in that time. The pace of growth was only a little less frantic in the euro area, where the largest banks' assets grew by 18% a year. The largest US banks grew by less - but the shadow banking sector was a much more important part of the story there.  The question is, to what extent should monetary policy be set explicitly with a view not only to medium-term output and inflation, but also to mitigating slow-burn financial stability risks? That is a challenge to the intellectual foundations of monetary policy. One natural response is to look to macro-prudential policy to provide an extra instrument or set of instruments to tackle financial stability risks. I shall return to the challenges for macro-prudential policy later, after saying a few words about liquidity provision. Liquidity provision The provision of liquidity to banks remains at the heart of a central bank's role. Market operations have had to evolve during the crisis both to accommodate different types of monetary policy - such as asset purchases financed by central bank reserves - and to respond to the heightened liquidity needs of the banking sector in times of crisis. Indeed, emergency liquidity support was a crucial factor in averting a banking sector collapse, and the awful consequences that would have ensued. The evidence of these changes can be seen in the huge expansion in central bank balance sheets since the summer of 2007. As Jean-Claude Trichet mentioned earlier, the Bank of England, Fed and ECB all expanded their balance sheets in broadly the same way. The danger of emergency liquidity provision is that it risks creating the expectation that it will always be available. That sets bad incentives for banks, and encourages excessive maturity transformation. We need a regulatory framework that provides the right incentives. International efforts to design such a liquidity regime are underway: but liquidity regulation remains a hugely challenging area. A central difficulty is in defining what constitutes a liquid asset. We have seen in the financial crisis that what might seem a liquid asset at one point in time, may quickly cease to be so under different circumstances. That leads one to the position that the only truly liquid assets are central bank reserves, or assets that can reliably be converted into reserves. The financial crisis also reminded us that liquidity can at best provide only temporary relief - it cannot substitute for the painful restructuring that is necessary to tackle solvency problems. It is better to avoid such difficulties in the first place, and macro-prudential policy has a big part to play in meeting that aspiration. There are significant challenges to overcome if macro-prudential policy is to live up to its promise. In the UK we have begun to operationalise macro-prudential policy through the Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee. Let me briefly explain something about the FPC, who serves on the Committee, and what we have been doing. Set up last year, the Committee comprises eleven voting members: five from within the Bank, two from the micro-prudential regulator, and four external members. Among those external experts our very first signing  was the person we are celebrating today, Don Kohn. I hope this is the start of a true transfer market in central bankers. Our remit from the Government - which is yet to be enacted in legislation - charges us with taking action to remove or reduce risks which could threaten the resilience of the financial system. The FPC expects to gain statutory powers in early spring of next year. But we have been up and running since June last year, and have in the interim made policy recommendations aimed among other things at improving the resilience of the banking sector and improving disclosure of information to markets. Drawing on our experience so far, I would like to remark on three of the challenges we have faced in beginning to make macro-prudential policy a reality. first has been to work out what instruments the FPC is going to use to meet its objectives. In the new architecture, which will come into effect in 2013, it is envisaged that the FPC will have the power first to direct the prudential and financial conduct regulatory bodies to take actions; second to recommend that those bodies take actions on a comply-or-explain basis; and third to make recommendations to other bodies. One of our early tasks has been to set out to the Government our views on the instruments over which we would have statutory power to direct the prudential and financial conduct regulatory bodies. We have been busy thinking about this for the past few months, and yesterday we published our advice to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Committee settled on a narrow set, comprising - for now - three instruments. The first of these is a countercyclical capital buffer to be part of a bank's capital requirement. This has the advantage that it is embedded in the Basel III international regulatory programme. It provides a simple aggregate tool that could play a role in mitigating excessive credit growth during upswings, while increasing the capacity of the system to absorb losses in the downswing. It will at times be important that banks meet required increases in capital ratios by raising capital rather than through potentially damaging reductions in assets. Indeed, this is a live issue for the FPC, reinforcing the point that it is important not only to be able to alter capital requirements, but also to be able to influence how those capital requirements are met. The second is the power to vary financial institutions' capital requirements against exposures to specific sectors. In practice that means scaling up the amount of capital that must be held against certain types of exposures. That makes it possible to take a more targeted approach to dealing with pockets of risk, for example in commercial or residential property. But there is a risk of mistaking symptoms for causes. The third instrument is a leverage ratio - that is, a maximum ratio of total liabilities to capital. This has the overwhelming benefit of simplicity and transparency, and provides a (time-varying) backstop to capital ratios that rely on risk-weighted assets. I myself attach great importance to a leverage ratio because of the impossibility of constructing risk weights that can anticipate major swings in sentiment, as we have seen recently with sovereign debt.  Of course there are many other potential instruments, and in several cases, the FPC recognised the potential effectiveness of these, but had reservations about their immediate practicability. For example, a good case can be made for an instrument that would tackle the build-up of liquidity risk. But it makes sense to wait to see what international micro-prudential standards are agreed before proceeding. The same can be said of the ability to vary the terms of collateralised transactions by financial institutions. In some cases a margining requirement could be useful to target risks in shadow banking or financing markets as we discussed this morning. But again, it makes sense to wait for international agreement. Margining requirements will work better as part of an international regime. We also recognised the potential usefulness of being able to vary mortgage terms and conditions, for example via loan to income or loan to value ratios. But such actions go further than discouraging particular types of lending. They limit the amount that any individual or business can borrow. That might better be left to the lenders to decide within an overall policy of making such lending more costly. So we concluded that further public debate was needed before those instruments could be requested by the FPC. We will be expected to report on the use of our direction powers on a very regular basis. But there are other areas, such as market structures or disclosure requirements, where the FPC will wish to make important, but infrequent, interventions. So it is important not to forget that the FPC will be able to issue 'comply or explain' recommendations to regulators. This is not the final word. Risks to financial stability will change over time, in a way that we cannot hope to predict. We will learn from our own and others' experience about the effectiveness of different instruments; and we will have to be ready to react and adapt to financial innovation. An important principle is that the FPC will keep under review the regulatory perimeter, and the instruments in its toolkit. It is important that provision is made for new tools to be added quickly when required. second challenge facing the UK FPC is in determining how macro-prudential policy interacts with the other branches of regulation and policy - in particular the micro-prudential regulator and monetary policy. Macro-prudential and micro-prudential policies clearly share a common interest, but the dividing line is blurred, and at times the opinions of the two sets of policy-makers are bound to differ. So there is question about how this can be managed. Fortunately the institutional arrangements in the UK take care of that, to a large extent. In general macro-prudential policy is about laying down rules for how the micro-prudential regulator should go about its task. It can provide an important underpinning and help to ensure consistency across regulated institutions. I have already noted that a challenge for monetary policy is the extent to which it should seek to play a role in financial stability. That goes to the heart of the question of how monetary and macro-prudential policies should interact. There are clear overlaps between the two policies, since they work through some of the  same channels. But, for a central bank pursuing monetary and financial stability, the addition of macro-prudential instruments reduces the extent to which the two objectives must be traded off. The two policies may at times act in different directions - one tightening, one loosening - and some people worry that this is problematic. In fact though, this is an indication that the second instrument is performing a useful function. That raises a question about whether monetary policy and financial stability policy decisions should be taken by the same group of people. In the UK the significant cross-membership of the Monetary Policy and Financial Policy Committees means that this coordination issue is of secondary importance. The more fundamental points are (i) to recognise the need for macro-prudential policy instruments; and (ii) to recognise that having macro-prudential tools does not preclude monetary policy from playing a role in financial stability. There may be times when the comparative bluntness but broad scope of interest rates is a positive advantage. final challenge for macro-prudential policy is a longer term one, going beyond the immediate issues of setting up the apparatus. That is to maintain over long periods of time the independence and legitimacy that macro-prudential policy needs to do its job effectively. That means winning the battle of hearts and minds. The FPC is charged with taking decisions that are necessary, but which may be unpopular at times, especially with the financial sector. In the Bank of England we now have two powerful policymaking bodies: one to take away the punchbowl as the party is getting going, and the other to turn the music down! If we are to maintain the ability to act independently and take unpopular decisions, it will be crucial to explain what we are doing and why. Setting realistic expectations for what can be achieved is an important objective. And, since these new policy instruments are to be wielded by unelected officials, the accountability arrangements need careful thought. The financial crisis represents a great opportunity to make changes to the financial system and the way we regulate it. Capturing the lessons learned now, while they are fresh in our minds, is of vital importance. That is why we are so grateful to have the benefit of Don's wisdom and experience contributing to the FPC in the UK. Looking ahead, our best hope of making lasting changes to the financial system, and capturing the lessons learned from the crisis in an enduring way, is to build that knowledge into institutions in whose memory it remains long after the people involved have left the scene.","['banking', 'bankers', 'banks', 'bank', 'monetary']","['central bankers', 'central bank', 'central banks', 'regulator monetary', 'banks challenges']","['central banks challenges', 'central bankers remit', 'banks financial crisis', 'central banks financial', 'don held bank']"
5474,r120911a_BOE,united kingdom,2012-09-11,Winding and unwinding extraordinary monetary policy,miles,0,"All speeches are available online at If cities competed for the title of the birth place of economics then Edinburgh would be one of the favourites. Hume and Smith would be contenders for individual medals. But such is the low popular standing of economics I rather doubt that there is much enthusiasm for handing out medals right now. This is not hard to understand: we have been through a near total collapse of the financial system followed by one of the deepest and longest recessions in history. I use ""we"" to include most of the western, rich world. Very few economists predicted this - though some warned about excesses in parts of the financial system and imbalances that might cause problems. But I am not going to apologise for the supposed failings of economics. In fact I am honoured to be asked to deliver the Scottish Economic Society Annual Lecture. I am going to talk about monetary policy and how it has been operated in the extraordinary - and I mean extraordinary in a bad way - environment of the past 5 years. I will assess whether some alternative policies might be more effective. I will also consider how we might get back to a more normal setting for monetary policy and whether we need to rethink the aims and tools of policy. Before I get to that let me take one and a half minutes to say why I don't feel inclined to devote time to apologising for the failings of economics. One reason is that the value of economics should not be gauged by how well economists can forecast the future. It is unfortunate then that many people are encouraged to think that this is pretty much the only yardstick to use. I think if you judged modern medicine by the same criterion you would not think it very valuable. But of course we don't do that. We believe doctors are worth listening to if we have a broken leg or have a brain tumour even though they may not have been able to predict that you would be in that unfortunate position. A second and stronger reason not to spend time apologising for economics is that one of the main criticisms made of it is so spectacularly wrong-headed that it should not be taken seriously. This is the criticism that economists became convinced that the actions of rational economic agents in shaping market outcomes would inevitably lead to stable and efficient outcomes. According to this criticism, since we have plainly not had stable and efficient outcomes over the past 5 years, then it would seem to follow that the guiding principles of economics are deeply flawed. Those who think they are presenting a sophisticated version of this critique will specifically mention the rational expectations and efficient markets hypotheses. In fact all the efficient markets hypothesis really says is that financial outcomes are pretty much unpredictable - not that they are desirable or efficient in the everyday meaning of that term. And the rational expectations hypothesis is really a way of thinking that stresses the importance of people's anticipation of future events in driving their decisions; it in no way means that the collective implications of such decisions must be optimal. In fact any undergraduate economics textbook spends a lot of time showing why market outcomes can be - and often are - sub-optimal. Economic thinking at the frontier of the subject has - for at least thirty years - stressed that a combination of rational behaviour by All speeches are available online at individuals and interaction between people in markets where there are information problems creates the potential for outcomes that are not at all likely to be optimal. One indication of the dominance of this type of thinking - a type of thinking completely at odds with the caricature that economists claim that free market outcomes are stable and efficient - is the list of economists who have won Nobel prizes. The largest group of people on that list won their prizes for work which showed that market outcomes could often be inefficient and sometimes unstable I find economic thinking very helpful in trying to understand why we have got into such a mess and, more importantly, how we might get out of it. Tonight I want to describe the part that monetary policy is playing, consider whether alternative policies might be more effective and explore some of the longer-term consequences of what we are still going through. I start by describing how policy has evolved over the past 5 years. Then I will assess whether monetary policy has stopped being effective and if a more radical step - explicit monetisation of government spending - is required. Finally I consider what the lessons from this extraordinary period are for the design of policy and assess how, in due course, the transition back to a more normal monetary policy might be made. Monetary policy during the crisis Monetary policy has been trying to offset extraordinary recessionary forces that arose in the wake of a near collapse of the banking system of the western world. The measures that have been taken to counter the extraordinary forces at play have themselves been March 2009. Even with Bank Rate at 0.5%, it looked like demand would be so weak that the economy would descend further so that inflation might undershoot its target in the medium term. Reducing Bank Rate further would have had the advantage of using an established instrument to implement monetary policy. But lowering Bank Rate would also have had disadvantages. First, it is not clear whether it would have substantially eased the supply of credit at those longer maturities that matter for consumption and investment. And second, it may have adversely affected the stability of a number of banks and building societies, whose profit margins were already squeezed: their interest income had fallen much more than their funding costs because they had a considerable stock of mortgages with interest rates contractually linked to Bank Rate, not to their own funding costs. I think there were reasons to believe that the benefits of cutting All speeches are available online at Bank Rate further were, at best, likely to be small and that the effects could well be perverse. I see no obvious reason to think things are much different today, though this is something to keep monitoring. With Bank Rate at 0.5% monetary policy has been further loosened through two other routes. First, the MPC embarked on asset purchases, aiming to increase the availability, and cut the cost, of funding (via equity or bond issuance or by other borrowing) for the private sector. One means would have been to purchase directly large quantities of private sector assets. This is what the Federal Reserve System did when purchasing mortgage-backed securities (though in fact most of such assets had the backing of government agencies which made them closer to government bonds than private sector assets). The MPC has instead decided that its - now enormous - asset purchases should be overwhelmingly of government bonds . The people that sell those bonds to the Bank then have to decide which alternative assets to acquire - these could either be claims on UK private sector entities (eg claims on UK companies that have issued bonds or equities or deposit claims on banks) or claims on foreign entities (by acquiring foreign equities or bonds or other debt claims issued by overseas companies and governments). The MPC has taken the indirect route of buying gilts and then letting the sellers make the portfolio allocation decisions that All speeches are available online at mean that the funds they get from the Bank are channelled into other places. It seems highly likely to me that many of those funds have been channelled into the UK corporate bond and equity markets . Some of the money has certainly gone towards buying claims on overseas assets - in which case that is likely to have an exchange rate impact as well as having effects on the domestic economy as the sterling is recycled. Some of the money flows directly to banks and stays with them - potentially helping with bank funding and liquidity problems that have at many times over the past few years been acute. One can argue about how effective all this has been in offsetting the recessionary impact of the financial crisis. But let me note in passing that one thing one cannot do is to take as proof of its ineffectiveness the fact that reserves held by banks at the Bank of England have gone up enormously. It is a mistake to see that as proof that somehow the money created by QE has got ""trapped"" in the banking sector and is doing no good. Creating reserves (that is commercial bank deposits at the Bank of England) is how the Bank of England finances its asset purchases. So it is not surprising that banks' reserve balances increased by a lot (Figure 2) - it is simply a matter of arithmetic. : The Bank's liabilities and assets, including outstanding amounts of lending facilities All speeches are available online at The money is going to come to sit at the Bank as reserves even if by its creation it has triggered multiple other transactions that have helped finance spending in the economy. This point is not well understood so let me take one minute to illustrate it. Suppose the Bank of England buys an extra PS1 million of gilts; the seller effectively gets a cheque drawn on the central bank. That cheque is cashed and so the bank of the seller of the gilt credits the seller's account and the cheque is presented to the Bank of England who credits the account of the commercial bank. So bank deposits are higher as are reserves held by banks at the Bank of England. Suppose the seller of the gilt now buys a newly created corporate bond that will finance some new investment. The bank account of the company that issued that corporate bond goes up and that of the buyer of that bond goes down. Some money will flow between two commercial banks if the buyer and seller of the corporate bond have different banks - if that happens some reserves at the Bank of England will move from one bank to another. The total level of reserves held at the Bank of England will not change. Now suppose in the next stage the company that issued the corporate bonds spends the money on investment, which means more wages and profits get generated somewhere else and so the money flows into bank accounts somewhere else. Economic activity is likely to be higher. Reserves may move (many times) from one bank's account at the Bank of England to another. But aggregate reserves held at the Bank of England will not change at all. Just looking at what has happened to total reserves at the Bank of England tells you nothing about this. Nothing. If all that economics taught us is this it would have done some good. All speeches are available online at Figure 3: Stocks of gilt holdings by sector Figure 3 shows who was holding gilts before and during the Bank's purchases (the last observation is Q1). The government, net, has issued more gilts since 2009 than the Bank purchased. [In fact, among the sectors that Figure 3 distinguishes, only the gilt holdings of 'other financial institutions' declined - these include, for example, securities and derivative dealers, mutual funds, and mortgage lenders.] But the fact that net issuance was larger than the Bank's purchases does not mean that the effect of the Bank's purchases was diminished. The impact of a policy has to be judged against what would have happened in the absence of the policy action. And unless one believes that net issuance of gilts would have been significantly lower had the Bank not purchased gilts, the private sector would have had to absorb a much larger stock of government debt. All else equal that would have reduced the supply of credit to the private sector. The Bank's purchases worked to offset that. I am not going to describe in detail the empirical evidence on the impact of the Bank's gilt purchases on the economy; this has been done elsewhere . I believe the evidence is that it has had a significant positive effect. Colleagues of mine at the Bank of England estimated that purchasing PS200bn worth of gilts during 2009-10 may have increased GDP by 1.5-2%. The fact that GDP itself has been more or less stagnant for much of the past eighteen months is not clear evidence that QE has become ineffective; it is evidence that the forces holding back a recovery remain powerful. All speeches are available online at Instead of focusing on the impact of QE on growth, attention has tended to concentrate on the reduction in gilt yields, probably because the impact of gilt purchases was most visible here. But it was never the ultimate objective of gilt purchases to lower gilt yields, just as a reduction in Bank Rate never has as its ultimate objective to lower yields on Treasury bills. Lowering gilt yields is only the first - and not necessarily the most important - link in a longer transmission mechanism whose overall effect is to increase the availability of funding for the private sector, raising demand for goods and services. The impact that the Bank's asset purchases had on the spreads between gilt yields and yields on corporate bonds, and on different types of bank lending, has been at least as important for the economy as the impact on the yields on government bonds. The second means by which the Bank loosened monetary conditions was an expansion of its lending facilities. With some facilities this worked by increasing the extent to which the Bank insures solvent banks against liquidity outflows. Figure 4 is a stylised representation of the evolution of the Bank's lending facilities during the crisis. Movements in the North East direction in the figure represent a widening in collateral and an extension of the maturity of lending. In most cases such movements represented an easing in funding conditions for banks. Liquidity insurance will be used more the lower the interest rate charged, the wider the type of collateral accepted, and the greater the range of time horizons for which the central bank lends. In normal times, the interest rate is the most important feature of the Bank's lending facilities: when banks' liquidity and solvency are not in doubt, banks are able to offset liquidity outflows with funds raised in private markets. So they only borrow comparatively small amounts of funds from the central bank. But in the recent crisis, banks had on occasion substantial difficulties in raising funds in private markets because investors doubted both their liquidity and solvency. Had the Bank offered to lend only against the highest-quality collateral, and only at a very short maturity, banks' liquidity risk may not have fallen back significantly from crisis levels. The term and the collateral requirements of its lending operations became important determinants of monetary conditions. By expanding these facilities, monetary conditions eased because a more comprehensive insurance of banks' liquidity risks increased their willingness to grant longer-term loans to the private sector. All speeches are available online at Evolution of Bank of England's lending facilities during the crisis Is monetary policy no longer effective? Despite the extraordinary monetary policy measures taken, growth in the UK has been anaemic - output has stagnated for more than a year. Some people take that fact - the fact of weak output - as proof that monetary policy has stopped being effective and, more specifically, that purchases of government bonds (what you might call conventional QE) is no longer effective. I think this is not very convincing because it ignores the range of factors which have restrained demand and which might have caused output to fall significantly had not an increasingly expansionary monetary policy been pushing back in the opposite direction. It is not as if it is hard to identify such forces - one of which is the clear deterioration in the funding conditions for banks across Europe that began in the Autumn of last year and which was followed by falling confidence across most of Europe and stagnation in economic activity. I am unconvinced that the stagnation we have seen over the past eighteen months in the UK is proof of the ineffectiveness of monetary policy. But I do take seriously the suggestions that alternatives to what I have Collateral eligibility criteria 4 years 12 months 3 months 6 months 1 week 3 years 3 and 6 month 6 month 3 month 1 week All speeches are available online at called conventional QE might be more powerful in boosting demand. One suggestion is that the MPC should undertake money financed spending - sometimes called a helicopter drop of money. My view on this can be summarised quickly: Either money financing (or helicopter drops) is done in a way which pays no attention to the inflation consequences - in which case it is not a very attractive policy - or it is done in a way which is sensitive to the longer-term inflation consequences, in which case the differences with conventional QE largely evaporate. Let me explain. It is useful to start by asking what is money financed spending (or helicopter drops)? One could think of this as the Bank of England sending a cheque to every household in the country. Would a PS1,000 Christmas bonus for every family in the UK from the Bank be a good idea? Let me make several points about the economics of this. In doing so I will put to one side the important question about the legitimacy of the MPC embarking on what looks like fiscal decisions - I just want to focus on the economics of the thing and ask how this strategy differs from what I have called conventional QE. Let me start by saying that what I have described as the Bank giving all families a Christmas Bonus is equivalent to a lump sum temporary tax cut - a one-off reverse poll tax - financed by new issuance of government bonds (i.e. standard fiscal policy) followed by the central bank buying those bonds in the secondary market a few moments later and then channelling all the coupons and redemptions on those bonds straight back to the Treasury. How is monetary part of this like conventional QE and how does it differ? It is like QE in the sense that the coupons and redemptions from the gilts the Bank has already bought are flows of money from the government that are accumulated in a fund that is effectively owned by the government. It is also like QE in that the policy can be reversed later on: with QE, the gilts can be sold, and with money-financed spending, the government could later increase taxes temporarily to recoup what it had paid out to households. The bank reserves that are created as a by-product of the Bank's QE gilt purchases are not zero-interest bearing money (as in a Friedman style helicopter drop) - they pay Bank Rate. But they do so in an environment in which Bank Rate is close to zero. The QE gilt purchases by the Bank are not guaranteed to be permanent - they can be reversed. Whether and when they are reversed will depend on inflation conditions and on what level of reserves the banking system comes to want to hold. Bank Rate will also depend on inflation conditions. So the key difference between the helicopter drops of money (which is money financed fiscal policy) and conventional QE is that, with the latter, the terms on which the asset purchases by the central bank are made are flexible and sensitive to inflation pressures in the economy, while with money financing they might not be. If Bank Rate is kept close to zero, if coupon payments on gilts are channelled back to the government and if new bonds are bought as old ones mature, then conventional QE looks very much like money financing of government spending (helicopter drops of money). If Bank Rate is increased, or if the stock of government bonds held by the Bank are run down, it will come to be less like helicopter drops of money. How much like helicopter drops it is depends on subsequent monetary policy decisions made in the light of inflation pressures. Why All speeches are available online at would one not want that? Why would irreversible helicopter drops be superior, when they might ultimately generate inflation pressures that would be unwelcome ? Why not prefer a more flexible policy where asset purchases can be adapted if inflation pressures pick up and the demand stimulus they generate no longer brings forth more output but instead just creates higher prices? Surely one wants unconventional monetary policy to boost demand when that generates more economic activity but to have a declining impact once the extra demand is largely showing up in higher prices rather than in volumes. To my mind this is exactly what asset purchases - conventional QE - does. If helicopter drops of money are reversed when their impact shows up very largely in prices and not in activity, the economic difference with conventional QE largely evaporates. The Bank's asset purchases can be reversed and are financed by the creation of reserves that pay Bank Rate. Therefore they are not the equivalent to permanent money financing of government spending. Yet some have argued that the Bank is effectively monetising the government's debt and has lost the focus on its inflation target. I believe this criticism is misguided. Monetising the debt would involve the central bank buying up government bonds permanently, and financing the purchase by issuing non-interest bearing liabilities, independently of predicted inflation . That is the crucial distinction between QE and what I called helicopter drops of money done in a way that is not adjusted if it later generates inflation. The decision of the MPC to embark on asset purchases on an enormous scale was not done because it had abandoned the inflation target; it was done because of the inflation target. It was done because the outlook for demand has been so weak that unless monetary policy was set to offset this it was likely that inflation would ultimately be driven below the target level as output languished far below the productive potential of the economy. The fact that many asset purchases were made at a time when inflation was substantially above target meant that many people interpreted it as an abandonment of the target. But that would only be a natural interpretation if the current level of inflation was a good indicator of underlying inflation pressures - and that was clearly not the case for much of 2011 and into 2012. The fact that the Bank has bought PS350 billion of assets and that most private sector forecasts now show inflation will remain near the target level is a telling piece of evidence against the argument that asset purchases show that the MPC has given up on inflation targeting. (There is a different argument that the MPC should give up on inflation targeting that I will return to Observations from this extraordinary period Let me stand back a moment and review what has happened over the past 5 years. Where we have got to is extraordinary: Bank Rate is at its lowest in 300 years and has been there since early 2009; The Bank's balance sheet has increased almost fivefold ; some PS350 billon of government bonds have been purchased by the central bank - and those purchases are continuing. The range of assets that commercial banks can All speeches are available online at use to borrow against from the Bank of England has been widened; and - more recently - the Funding for Lending Scheme has been launched - a scheme that in some ways sits in the grey area between monetary and fiscal policy and one that I will return to in a moment. I make three observations on monetary policy in the light of these extraordinary events. First, it is sometimes alleged that a central bank becomes powerless when short-term interest rates are near zero. The rationale is that at near-zero interest rates, the private sector's opportunity costs from holding money are also near zero, so the private sector is willing to hold any amount of money that the central bank injects without requiring a further decline in interest rate. The central bank then cannot relax monetary conditions further: the economy is in a liquidity trap. This is not a good description of where we have been. It assumes that there is only one short term interest rate in the economy. In fact the rates that really matter to the private sector - for example rates charged on business loans, yields on corporate bonds and rates on mortgages - have been far above the policy rate set by the Bank of England. One of the central aims of QE has been to try to stop those spreads widening further and to ease the flow of credit to the private sector. Clearly the cost of bank funding in private markets has remained substantially above Bank Rate. Longer-term lending programmes such as the recently launched Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS) have been designed to increase credit supply by reducing banks' funding costs, particularly for new lending. The FLS is designed to ease monetary conditions by helping banks secure funding in private markets for a four-year period - a much longer term than that of other Bank lending operations. The scheme incentivises banks to expand lending because funding is cheaper the greater the rise (or smaller the fall) in lending. What makes the scheme attractive to banks is not only the small size of the fee that the Bank charges but, crucially, also the Bank's willingness to accept collateral that private market participants might refuse. None of this would be necessary if we were in a liquidity trap. My second observation is that the boundary between monetary and fiscal policy can become blurred in crisis times. I illustrated this above in my comparison of out and out money financed spending (helicopter drops of money) and what I call conventional QE. Gilt purchases might seem to fall into the grey area between monetary and fiscal policy because they lower gilt yields, and reduce the Treasury's refinancing costs. The blurring is also to some extent there with all liquidity support operations and with the Funding for Lending Scheme. Lending to banks against a wide range of collateral and for a longer term increases the central bank's credit risk, so ultimately puts taxpayers' money at risk. In the Funding for Lending Scheme the Bank accepts a wide range of collateral, including new loans that the banks make. Because the value of the collateral is not guaranteed, this introduces an element of credit risk even in the presence of over-collateralisation [that is the substantial haircuts that the Bank makes]. All speeches are available online at My final observation is about the link between the amount of central bank reserves and inflation. It is sometimes claimed that the huge expansion of reserves held at the central bank - which are the counterpart to QE - has to greatly increase inflation at some point in the future. This argument is based implicitly on some version of the quantity equation for money: the supply of money (M) multiplied by the velocity with which money circulates (V) is equal to the price level (P) multiplied by the number of transactions paid for This equation is simply a definition for the velocity of money. But some commentators interpret it as if there were a mechanical link between the growth of reserves (part of a narrow measure of M) and ultimate changes in the price level P. This really asks too much of an identity. Inflation arises when demand for goods and services exceeds the supply potential of the economy at a given price level. My own view is that demand depends on interest rates far more reliably than it does upon a measure of the amount of money. Crucially, as long as the central bank retains control over the short-term interest rate, it can operate monetary policy with a substantially higher amount of reserves. If the Bank did not remunerate reserves at the policy rate, short-term market interest rates might fall below it. By remunerating reserves at Bank Rate, short-term market interest rates are much less likely to fall below Bank Rate: because of arbitrage, investors with reserve accounts - which include all the UK's major banking groups - should not grant loans at an interest rate below Bank Rate. The quantity equation if used in a mechanical way omits the impact of interest rates and it tells one nothing about shifts in the demand for money that will make velocity vary. And in fact velocity is highly variable. Figure 5 plots an estimate of the velocity of narrow money, assuming that the total number of transactions is proportional to real GDP. This estimate of velocity had been around 30 between the early 1990s and 2006, reflecting the low level of central bank reserves, before the Bank started to pay interest on reserves in 2006. It fell further when the banking sector's reserve holdings increased during the Bank's asset purchases, falling to a level of about 7 by Q1 2012. All speeches are available online at Velocity of money, measured as annual nominal GDP / sum of reserves, notes and coin Empirical studies tend to use a broader monetary aggregate, such as M4 - rather than the sum of reserves, notes and coins (also referred to as M0) - when computing the velocity of money. Indeed, the ratio of nominal GDP to M4 is much steadier, having fallen from around 2 during the sixties and seventies to around 1 today (Figure 6). But this does not shed any light on the link between the amount of reserves and inflation, precisely because the relationship between M4 and M0 is as volatile as the relationship between nominal Claiming that asset purchases and the rise in reserves must lead to much higher inflation down the road is therefore wrong. The key factor is whether Bank Rate - and the stock of asset purchases - are appropriately set to meet the inflation target given the relative movements of demand and supply; and, more generally, whether the monetary policy stance is appropriate. Historically, growth in some monetary aggregate may well have been associated with consumer price inflation over the long run - but only if interest rates have moved in such a way as to make such a co-movement possible. All speeches are available online at : The money multiplier, measured as M4 divided by the sum of reserves, notes and coin All speeches are available online at The MPC loosened monetary conditions in order to meet the Bank's inflation target in the face of a downturn almost unprecedented in modern economic times. The MPC's forecasts suggested that without this loosening, which involved an increase in the amount of reserves, inflation would have undershot its target in the medium term. Measures of underlying inflation, which attempt to exclude the influences of one-off shocks on the price level from the headline inflation rate, were volatile but taken as a whole remained close to target during the past few years (Figure 8). When the MPC's inflation projections suggest that monetary conditions should be tightened, it will reverse some of the extraordinary stimulus that monetary policy has provided over the past few years. Measures of underlying inflation What should the post-crisis monetary policy framework look like? The way in which the Bank implements monetary policy has changed substantially since the start of the crisis . Some of the changes are temporary - I believe, for example, the main policy instrument will again be Bank Rate, not purchases and sales of gilts. But other changes will be more long lasting. For example although the FLS (and the SLS before it) are designed to be temporary schemes, the liquidity insurance All speeches are available online at facilities introduced since 2007-08 have become part of the Bank's permanent Sterling Market Framework. And the Bank will probably operate permanently with a substantially larger balance sheet: banks have learnt that they took excessive liquidity risks before the crisis, and are likely to want to hold substantially higher levels of liquid assets in future (Figure 9). Some of these assets are likely to be held in the form of central bank reserves. : Sterling liquid assets relative to total asset holdings of the UK banking sector I want to look at three specific questions about policy in the future. First, whether there is a compelling argument against continuing to remunerate reserves at Bank Rate and allowing banks to choose their reserve targets; second, whether the inflation target should be raised to reduce the likelihood that the monetary policy stance is too tight even with Bank Rate at (almost) zero; and third, whether the inflation targeting regime should be changed. In the pre-crisis system of implementing monetary policy banks chose, subject to some restrictions, the ","['economists', 'economics', 'medals', 'economy', 'economic']","['economics edinburgh', 'scottish economic', 'economists won', 'gauged economists', 'failings economics']","['economics edinburgh favourites', 'scottish economic society', 'place economics edinburgh', 'deliver scottish economic', 'economics gauged economists']"
5655,r150605a_BOE,united kingdom,2015-06-05,Reflections on the FPC: the road ahead,kohn,0,"It is a pleasure to be able to speak to the Society of Business Economists. Your Chairman suggested I reflect on my years on the Financial Policy Committee, and I will do that, but I will spend most of my time looking forward - giving my views on some broad priorities for the FPC in coming years. I have been a member of the Committee since its inception as the interim FPC in the spring of 2011. In that time I believe we have accomplished much to make the UK financial system safer and put in place the foundations for continuing that work in the future. We have worked with the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) to build the resilience of the UK banking system - especially to build its capital cushion against future shocks - so that it can continue to deliver financial services to the real economy in the face of adverse economic and financial developments, and without requiring further taxpayer support. To this end, we phased in the Basel 3 capital risk-weighted capital requirements as quickly as possible for UK banks and instituted a minimum leverage ratio; there is still some work to be done, but major UK banks are now comfortably ahead of the Basel 3 transition timetable. Greater capital supports growth not only by making crises less likely and less severe, but also because well-capitalized banks have been shown to be more willing to lend. Last year the FPC and the PRA initiated concurrent capital stress tests across large UK banks and are making these tests a regular part of the capital framework. This was a major innovation and strengthens our ability to be explicit about what we see as the important risks to financial stability in the UK and to test the banks' resilience to those risks. Last year we tested banks' resilience against the effects of a substantial rise in UK interest rates and a fall in property prices; this year our stress scenario originates in a major shortfall in growth in the rest of the world. The horizontal comparisons across banks from these tests can be particularly revealing about the relative capital positions, modelling characteristics, and risk management capabilities of each major UK bank. These tests also importantly increase transparency to the public about the FPC's view of risks to financial stability, the individual bank's ability to withstand those risks, and the actions the FPC and PRA are taking in response to the results. In that regard the stress tests are an important new element in the accountability of the FPC and the PRA. I expect the stress test to play a major role in our execution of macroprudential policy in the future and I expect us to continue to develop our ability to use the information we collect to identify threats to financial stability, such as procyclicality of bank risk models, interconnections among banks that may not be evident on the surface, and crowded and correlated positions that make the system vulnerable to particular asset price movements. The FPC has also identified various risks to financial stability beyond those posed by potential bank credit losses and made recommendations to deal with them. For example, we highlighted the dangers of cyber attack, and the potential for rising house prices to cause borrowers to become so indebted for the purchase of houses such that they would need to cut back sharply on spending should interest rates spike  unexpectedly or income be temporarily depressed. In both cases we made recommendations that were implemented to counter the perceived risks. And we worked with the banks to enhance their disclosures and thereby strengthen the ability of their private sector counterparties to monitor and price the riskiness of banks through greater bank transparency - especially around capital risk calculations. Finally we have put in place much of the basic framework required to operate macroprudential policy on an ongoing basis. We worked with HM Treasury and Parliament to get authority for the tools we need - including powers of direction over capital, leverage and key terms of lending against residential real estate. And we issued policy statements outlining how we might use these powers of direction to sustain financial stability. As a Committee, we have established good working relationships with the PRA, the Financial Conduct through the PRA and FCA and they and we need to have a good understanding of what each authority is trying to accomplish and how our actions affect the objectives of the others. The chief executives of the PRA and FCA are both members of the FPC and have provided guidance on how to shape our recommendations to accomplish our objectives. Both macroprudential and monetary policy seek to accomplish their separate objectives by affecting aspects of financial conditions, so it is critical that each committee understand what and how the other intends to operate and can weigh the implications for meeting its objectives. The FPC has been asked to provide an independent voice on financial stability - by the MPC and by Treasury (in help-to-buy) to assess the financial stability implications of their policies. We are not completely finished with establishing the macroprudential framework: we need to complete the capital framework; we have requested powers of direction for buy-to-let lending; and the FPC will always need to be alert to the possibility that preserving financial stability in an evolving financial landscape could require new tools in new areas. But I believe the basic structure is largely in place. Going forward we will be placing more emphasis on how we use the structure; it is a time of transition for the FPC. Having just begun a new three-year term with the FPC, I would like to use this occasion to look forward, to reflect now on what I hope we can accomplish in the next three years, building on the approach already in place. I will concentrate on two broad challenges: first, how the FPC can continue to build a systematic and disciplined approach to macroprudential policy - to identifying risks and using our powers of direction and recommendation to address them; and second, how the FPC can contribute to fostering safe and resilient market alternatives to bank finance in the UK. Systematic and disciplined approach to macroprudential policy A good deal of uncertainty about macroprudential policy is inevitable: policy will need to respond to threats from unexpected developments - possibly from abroad in globally linked markets - interacting in unexpected  ways with complex and only imperfectly understood financial systems. But within that inherently uncertain environment, the FPC can work to make macroprudential policy more systematic and predictable. This will help market participants to plan and to anticipate our policy actions, and those anticipatory actions should help stabilize the system under many circumstances. Systematic and transparent policy-making also facilitates public accountability: for how we intend to identify risks that embody externalities with macroeconomic and financial stability implications; for how we will determine appropriate responses that are targeted and proportionate to the risks and consistent across time and circumstances; and for how we weigh our secondary objective for growth and employment alongside our primary objective for financial stability. We do need to recognize that there are likely to be some limitations on systematic, predictable, macroprudential policy - say, as compared to monetary policy. Most obviously, we have no ready continuing measure of how we are doing relative to our financial stability objective that is comparable to inflation readings for monetary policy. Financial instability is mostly obvious after it has occurred. Moreover there are multiple kinds and degrees of instability with varying implications for the financial sector and the real economy; for example asset price overshooting with limited leverage like dot-com equities, versus housing price overshooting in the presence of highly leveraged lenders and borrowers. Both can have adverse effects on the economy, but the disruptions to the financial sector in the second case proved a much more potent downward force on employment and economic activity. As I will discuss below, we have developed a set of indicators for financial stability, but refining and testing those indicators is an ongoing challenge. In addition, we have little experience with using macroprudential tools in a countercyclical way in a highly developed, globally integrated economy like that of UK. These types of tools were more common in the UK and US several decades ago, when markets were less developed and arbitrage opportunities more limited, and they have been more widely used in emerging market economies in recent times. But for the UK today, we have limited information to use to draw inferences in order to gauge calibration and effectiveness. Nonetheless, I believe we can and should be able to make further progress toward systematic and disciplined macroprudential policy. I see two broad areas for such progress. First, we can continue to develop a more systematic approach to identifying risks and deciding which tools to use to address them. This should be aided as much as possible through monitoring a set of indicators we and you can have confidence in. Identification of risks and indicators of risks is challenging. We are looking for systemic risks, which generally involve market failures that are not embodied in market prices or captured by institution-by-institution microprudential oversight. Examples would include asset mispricing owing to widespread complacency or over confidence; complex and opaque interconnections among key financial market institutions; crowded trades that might reverse with widespread consequences; broad increases in lender leverage or maturity mismatches that look relatively benign on an individual institution basis; substantial increases in borrower leverage; or a buildup of macroeconomic or macrofinancial imbalances that might hold the potential for sharp changes in asset prices or credit availability when they correct.  In addition, systemic risks often involve the tails of distributions - vulnerabilities to unexpected developments. Financial institutions, investors, households, businesses, do not plan on being unable to meet their obligations, or to have difficulty trading out of a position, or to take a loss that impairs their ability to spend or hire. But they could be vulnerable to unexpected shocks that subject them to extreme events against which they are not adequately prepared. Our job is to identify tail events to which they are vulnerable and that could pose an unacceptable risk to financial stability. Of course we already look at indicators of the sorts of imbalances and distortions that have preceded past crises. These include the build-up of leverage and maturity mismatch in banks and other intermediaries; the rapid growth of credit to households and businesses relative to income; current account imbalances that might imply a build-up of indebtedness and greater vulnerability to developments elsewhere; and asset pricing, for example for houses or risky bonds, that looks extreme relative to standard metrics. But the threats next time might well come from a different direction, and problems could be amplified by newer characteristics of financial markets. Among other things, activity and risks are likely to migrate to different parts of the financial system and the consequences of tail events change shape as market participants adapt to the shifting regulatory landscape after the global financial crisis. Identifying indicators for newer types of vulnerabilities - the next problem - is even harder than for the issues we have experience with, but is absolutely necessary. The FPC has a set of indicators we publish and use as a first step toward deeper analysis of possible emerging threats to stability. I expect us to refine these over coming years. The reactions and inputs of business economists and others knowledgeable about financial markets would be most helpful in this regard. Do you find the FPC indicators helpful? What indicators do you use? What new information would you like to have as you assess vulnerabilities in the financial landscape? The Bank consults regularly with a wide array of business and financial market participants and I reach out regularly myself to help identify risks and assess the effect of our actions. The analysis of risk in turn should point toward the most appropriate tool to address the risk. Where is the market failure that threatens financial stability? What is the most efficient and effective way to reduce that A broad increase in credit through the banking sector might be addressed by an increase in the countercyclical capital buffer for banks which would better assure their resilience to a reversal of the cycle to a turn in asset prices whose upward movement had been fueled by credit or an increase in debt servicing problems among borrowers should interest rates rise and growth slacken. An increase in capital requirements, which, if binding, would raise the effective cost of funding loans a little, might help to damp the buildup in credit itself, though I suspect that effect will be quite limited in the face of optimistic expectations fueling strong demand and ample supply of credit; but a rise in capital will unambiguously bolster resilience.  Imbalances and risks that appeared to emanate from particular sectors might call for tools focused on that sector, that could be aimed at reducing exposure/leverage from either the lender or borrower side - or some combination. Higher sectoral capital requirements, for example for bank real estate lending, would make that lending a little less profitable and by potentially increasing bank capital would make banks extending such loans less vulnerable to risk from that lending - help them weather a turn in the market and pick up in defaults. If the market failure arose from households becoming too exposed to certain types of mortgage loans that left them particularly vulnerable to changing economic circumstances, the most effective restrictions might be ones that place limits on the terms of the lending - for example the interest rate stress test and LTI restrictions the FPC recommended for residential real estate lending last June. Experience in other jurisdictions implies that these sorts of product restrictions can be effective at damping credit and price cycles, perhaps more so than actions on bank capital. Second, we should be able to improve and make more systematic the calibration of our tools by making progress on analysis of the impact - that is the costs and benefits - from changing regulations. As noted, we have limited experience to analyse this in the UK, but the FPC is required to act proportionately and to do a cost-benefit analysis where possible. To some extent, costs may be more obvious, immediate, and easier to quantify than benefits - in terms of raising the price or restricting the availability of credit and imposing compliance costs on institutions. The benefits of reducing the odds on future instability are longer-term and harder to specify. Still, those benefits are considerable, as we have learned so painfully over the past few years. Refining impact analysis can help us with: policy design and calibration - selecting the tool or combination of tools best suited to address the problem, and the calibration most likely to produce a positive balance of benefits over costs; communication and public accountability - explaining our choice, the reasons for it, and the outcome we anticipate from its use; and evaluating those outcomes relative to expectations. None of this will come easily and quantification of costs and especially benefits will be subject to considerable uncertainty. But it is important that the FPC's framework and approach to policy weigh what we can determine about the costs and benefits of our recommendations and directions. We will gain experience over time, and will continue to refine our models and techniques. By establishing a systematic and disciplined policy making approach, the FPC will be better able to achieve its statutory objectives of protecting financial stability and supporting growth. But it is important to be clear and have common expectations of what macroprudential policy and the FPC can achieve. Asset prices will fluctuate and overshoot long-term sustainable levels from time to time. Financial intermediaries will make poor decisions or be hit with unexpected developments, some of which will be serious enough to undermine viability and cause failure. But if the FPC and other authorities do their jobs right, neither of these will threaten financial stability. The system will continue to intermediate between savers and borrowers, offer risk  management services, and deliver payments without interruption and at prices that allow the UK economy to live up to its full potential. Fostering safe, resilient, efficient market alternatives to bank finance in the UK The second broad area I expect to make progress on in the next three years is fostering resilient and efficient market alternatives to bank finance in the UK. Developing these alternatives is important for a number of reasons. Intermediation is already shifting to some extent outside banks into securities markets, as evidenced by a large volume of corporate bond issuance in recent years, and we need to identify and address any financial stability concerns resulting from that shift. This shift is partly in response to record low long-term rates resulting from weak economies and the efforts of central banks to stimulate growth and hit inflation targets using unconventional monetary policies. It also reflects some restraint on business lending by banks--as they rebuild balance sheets after the crisis and as their costs reflect tighter regulation and higher capital and liquidity requirements imposed to prevent a repeat of the global financial crisis. So incentives to channel a smaller proportion of intermediation through banks than before the crisis are likely to persist. At the same time, financial market structures are evolving, partly in response to the increase in the demand from borrowers for market finance, but also reacting to regulatory changes after the global financial crisis and to new technologies, which are changing the nature of risks. Savings have been redirected from banks to funds run by asset managers operating in securities markets. Regulation is moving more derivative transactions onto exchanges and through central counterparties, which increase transparency and clarify interconnections, but also tend to concentrate risk. The spread of ""big data"" and algorithmic trading may create or at least intensify some feedback loops in asset pricing and have unpredictable effects on market liquidity. Increased flows through capital markets have the potential to create material benefits for financial stability and for savers and borrowers. Businesses and households (through securitization) will have access to a greater diversity of funding sources. Having financing available through both banks and markets has been characterized as a ""spare tyre"" approach to intermediation - if one aspect of intermediation is impaired, the other could be available to take up the slack. This possibility helped the US weather a number of financial shocks - until the crisis when both ""tyres"" were flat, in part because complex and obscure interconnections had developed between them. And a variety of intermediation channels facilitates innovation and competition, reducing costs to household and business borrowers and enhancing returns to lenders. But there are potential risks to financial stability when market finance is not done right, and the most telling example of that is the US subprime mortgage market in the years leading up to the crisis. In that market, substantial, unwarranted, credit easing was supported by innovations in market-based securitization that entailed a marked increase in leverage and maturity mismatch in securitizations held outside of banks,  though often with bank exposure through implicit or explicit back-up facilities - think SIVs and asset-backed commercial paper conduits. Moreover, the instruments created in the securitization and tranching process were opaque and complex, behaving in unanticipated ways under stress and creating uncertainty about the incidence of losses as real estate prices fell and borrowers defaulted, leading to panics and fire sales when confidence eroded. Other, new types of risks may develop as more funds flow through markets where smooth functioning is dependent on market liquidity and market plumbing being in good order. Doing it right - fostering safe and resilient market-based finance is a medium term priority for the FPC. The FPC is far from the only player involved promoting this objective - for example the steps to create a capital markets union in the EU will be important. But the FPC has a key role to play in the UK. We need to make sure that markets develop in ways that protect overall financial stability. Identifying risks, market failures, and externalities in the securities and securitization markets and devising approaches to deal with them have their own special set of challenges, however. These new threats to financial stability are likely to occur in structures and institutions outside, or only indirectly related to, the more heavily and directly regulated sectors. This potential highlights the importance of reviewing the regulatory perimeter (the nature and extent of regulation on different sectors and markets) on a regular basis, trying to identify gaps that regulators and, on occasion Parliament, might need to fill. And we will need to continue to work closely with the FCA and PRA to gather information about how the system and risks are evolving and consider responses. The risks we should be looking for could be quite different from the leverage or maturity mismatch or poor underwriting standards issues that we are used to dealing with in banks. And the materialization of these risks could disrupt intermediation and damage the real economy. For example our current analyses of risks from securities markets have examined the effects on pricing of the ""search for yield""; possible increases in herding behaviour as more funds are administered through asset managers; the effects of perceptions of first-mover advantage by investors in these funds if they fear overshooting of asset prices; and the apparent decline in market liquidity, which could exacerbate the resulting asset price volatility. Moreover, securities and securitization markets are global in character. That facilitates savings flowing to the most productive capital projects. But it also implies an exposure to risks originating around the world when UK action, by itself, may not be sufficient to assure safe and efficient markets, especially with London a key node in the global financial system. The UK will benefit from a global approach to global markets, and, fortunately, the Financial Stability Board has been formulating such an approach. A critical element in safe and efficient markets is the ""plumbing"" of those markets - how securities are traded and financed. As noted, central counterparties and data warehouses will make interconnections and risks more transparent - but they also concentrate risk so we need to get oversight right globally. Securities  financing transactions proved to be a source of instability in the global financial crisis, and the FSB is leading an effort to take a close look at these and address risks through minimum haircuts and other measures. The FPC's approach to its concerns about market liquidity illustrate the kinds of steps we will need to take to analyse the potential financial stability implications of the shift to market finance and then to determine whether a policy response is required. We set out in a box in the December 2014 FSR our thinking on the causes of market illiquidity in order to delineate and deepen the analysis of this issue. Then in March this year, we asked the Bank and the FCA to encourage and contribute to international work to build an understanding of vulnerabilities. We asked them to explore the channels through which UK financial stability could be affected by a decline in market liquidity. We asked to them to gather information from UK asset managers about how they planned to deal with a potential stressed market liquidity situation. And we asked them to assess how and why liquidity in relevant markets might have become more fragile. In sum, we have initiated work to deepen analysis and understanding of the risks, in particular to the UK; we have encouraged work in international fora; and we are gathering information what market participants are doing about any developing risks from market illiquidity. Once we get this information - now scheduled for Q3 this year - we will decide whether there is anything we should do to address whatever market failures and vulnerabilities are identified - be that acting in the UK alone or by the Bank advocating positions within the global context. The FPC has accomplished much, but much remains to be done in building a structure to protect financial stability in the UK. Let me be clear: I don't mean to imply that FPC has not been following a systematic and disciplined approach to fulfilling its mandate; we have, but macroprudential regulation is new and we are climbing a learning curve. The UK has a well-designed system for macroprudential regulation and its interaction with microprudential and monetary policies, and I am honored to be a part of it. We need to continue to develop how it is used. I have outlined an ambitious agenda for the future, but much work is already underway. Interactions - two-way communication - with informed observers like yourselves will be important to our success. We need to work on enhancing public understanding of what we are trying to do. And we need your perspective on how we are doing and what we could do to meet our objectives. I am grateful for the opportunity to talk to you today. You can invite me back in three years to hold me to account for how well the FPC has met the ambitious agenda I have laid out tonight.","['banking', 'banks', 'bank', 'finance', 'financial']","['uk banking', 'finance uk', 'uk financial', 'uk banks', 'financial uk']","['uk financial stability', 'uk financial safer', 'financial stability uk', 'bank finance uk', 'uk bank advocating']"
5769,r161123a_BOE,united kingdom,2016-11-23,Uncertainty about Uncertainty,forbes,0,"Uncertainty is the modern equivalent of a ""whipping boy"" for economics. A whipping boy was an official court position in the Tudor and Stuart monarchies. The boy was punished when the crown prince misbehaved, even if the boy played no role in the prince's transgression. Similarly today, ""uncertainty"" is often blamed for any expected weakness in company earnings or broader economic growth - especially uncertainty around the UK's relationship with the European Union. For example, about one-third of profit warnings by UK companies in Q3 mentioned uncertainty around Brexit and sterling. about the demand outlook and future trade arrangements as the biggest drag on investment intentions in their November update. Even the MPC minutes have recently set a record of averaging 15 mentions of uncertainty each meeting, up sharply from averaging less than 6 times per meeting since the Committee was created. Despite this heightened discussion about uncertainty, UK economic performance has been solid. Quarterly economic growth has picked up from 0.4% in Q1, to an average of 0.6% for Q2 and Q3. This is well above the consensus expectation by economic forecasters, as well as the MPC forecast. In fact, average GDP growth over the quarters of heightened uncertainty directly before and after the UK referendum on EU membership has been stronger than for all of 2015. It has even been above what is generally believed to be the UK's potential growth rate. This raises obvious questions. Are we overestimating the negative economic effects of uncertainty? Is the ease of blaming the ""whipping boy"" of uncertainty causing us to miss important underlying dynamics in the UK economy? Just as the whipping boy of the 15 and 16 centuries was not always irrelevant to his punishment, however, UK earnings and the broader economy are not unaffected by the uncertainty at hand. The whipping boy was not a poor, innocent, unrelated street urchin. He was a well-born and titled friend of the crown prince. His close relationship with the prince meant that the royal would (hopefully) be less likely to misbehave so that his friend was not whipped. As a confidant of the prince, the whipping boy could also play a role in encouraging proper behaviour. Similarly, uncertainty around the UK's future relationship with the European Union has undoubtedly had some impact on companies' investment plans and the aggregate economy - and will continue to do so in the future. But the key question is: how much? Figure 1 captures this challenge. The black shaded bars show the MPC's best collective forecasts for economic growth in Q2 and Q3 of 2016 from the half-way through the relevant quarter. More specifically, the bar for 2016 Q2 shows the growth forecast for Q2 as made in May, and the bar for 2016 Q3 shows the forecast made in August. The green lines show the actual rate of GDP growth (based on the most  Next, the red line in each column shows an estimate of growth if the mechanical drag from uncertainty (as estimated using a separate SVAR model similar to that in Haddow et al., 2013) was removed from that quarter's forecast. In each case, growth would have been expected to be higher and closer to actual GDP growth, especially after the referendum, albeit not fully explaining the gap. Although a series of well- respected academic papers provide evidence that uncertainty can drag on growth through numerous channels, this exercise suggests that mechanically removing the drag from uncertainty from our forecast would have substantially reduced our forecast errors. Of course, there are many other factors that could have spurred stronger growth than expected over this period, but overestimating the impact of uncertainty should be in the line-up of suspects. counterfactuals and outcomes with higher consumption As further evidence of how overestimating the negative impact of uncertainty could significantly bias economic forecasts, Figure 2 shows an alternate scenario for annual UK GDP growth in 2016 and 2017 that I discussed at our August MPC meeting (in red), along with the collective MPC forecast (in black). This alternate scenario was one of the reasons why I did not support as aggressive a monetary easing at that time and voted against quantitative easing. My alternate scenario made just one change to our baseline  forecast: that consumption growth was stronger and remained at the same rate as the average over the previous year. Uncertainty was still assumed to have a substantial impact on investment, and monetary policy assumed to follow the market curve, both according to the standard treatment in our forecasts. Under this alternate scenario, growth was still expected to slow, but only to a trough of 1 1/2 % yoy, instead of to about 0.5% as in the consensus MPC August forecast. The green squares show the MPC's most recent estimate of growth in Q3 and its published November forecast for the next three quarters. My alternate scenario with stronger consumption growth still underestimated recent growth, but by a lesser degree than in the collective forecast, and better captured the shallower slowdown that is now widely expected. This comparison highlights the sensitivity of economic forecasts to assumptions about the effects of uncertainty on consumption - even without adjusting for any reduced effect of uncertainty on investment - which is believed to be even more important. The tradition of the whipping boy in Tudor and Stuart England came about due to belief in the Divine Right of Kings, which made it inappropriate to whip a crown prince. Economic forecasters, however, are not subject to the same protection today, including the MPC. Therefore, my goal in these comments is to question, analyse, and challenge the treatment of uncertainty in our economic forecasts. There is no doubt that uncertainty matters - but how important is it? Are we accurately capturing its effects? In an attempt to better understand these issues, my comments will address three questions. First, how should we measure uncertainty? Second, do different measures of uncertainty affect different sectors of the economy? Finally, how will heightened uncertainty in the UK today affect the economy in the future? The answers to these questions could have first-order importance for our forecast, and therefore the appropriate path of monetary policy. The shaded black bar on the right side of Figure 1 shows the MPC's The red line shows the impact of removing the mechanical drag from uncertainty from this forecast - with growth increasing to 0.6% (and assuming no other adjustments are made). If growth remains around this higher level, then unemployment is unlikely to increase significantly and there would be no meaningful slack in the economy. In this case, monetary policy may need to be tightened sooner than expected. Moreover, if there is no meaningful output gap, I would find it more difficult to look through the expected inflation overshoot to above the 2% target in three years, even if it largely resulted from sterling's recent depreciation. But are we overestimating the impact of uncertainty? Before answering that question, it is necessary to take a step back and think about how to measure uncertainty and how it can affect the economy.  Uncertainty is a concept that is easy to talk about, but hard to measure. Some types of uncertainty might affect businesses, while other types might affect consumers. Uncertainty about sterling might affect large exporters, but not smaller, domestically-focused firms. Uncertainty about mortgage costs might have a greater effect on homebuilders and young adults than the older generation. Carney (2016) highlights that uncertainty can come in many forms - such as economic uncertainty, geopolitical uncertainty, and policy uncertainty. Economists try to differentiate between model uncertainty (when an agent is uncertain about the correct model of the economy), Knightian uncertainty (when the distribution of outcomes for a variable is uncertain), and Bayesian uncertainty (when the shape of the parameter distribution is uncertain). Critically important is differentiating between a deterioration in the expected outcome and a greater range of expected outcomes. The first is not uncertainty, just bad news. The second is uncertainty, but often hard to differentiate from the first, especially as people often become more pessimistic in the face of greater uncertainty. In the context of the recent vote on UK membership in the European Union, a ""Remain"" voter might believe that leaving the European Union means a lower path for economic growth. This lower forecast for growth would be a deterioration in the first moment and not necessarily an increase in uncertainty. An increase in uncertainty would be a greater range of possible outcomes for growth - the second moment - and correspond to a widening in the fan chart around the mean growth path. Although the distinction sounds obvious, it is very difficult to measure, especially in surveys where individuals have trouble distinguishing between these two concepts. Also critically important when measuring uncertainty is capturing the various ways in which uncertainty can manifest itself. This is made more difficult as the types of uncertainty that are a concern can change over time. For example, Figure 3 shows word clouds from the MPC's Minutes during four periods when mentions of ""uncertainty"" increased sharply. Words near the centre are mentioned more often, and the size of each word is scaled by its frequency. In 2002, mentions of uncertainty occurred at the same time as traditional concerns for monetary policy about higher inflation - with frequent links to words such as: price level, higher, increase, inflation, and expectations. In 2008, mentions of uncertainty occurred frequently with words such as: credit conditions, tighten, banks, and lending - highlighting concerns about the tightening of credit conditions that occurred at that time. In 2010, concerns shifted to uncertainty about the euro area and fiscal policy, with frequent use of words such as: euro area, market, government, fiscal, debt, and bond. In 2016, a new set of words stands out in the cloud linked to uncertainty: United Kingdom, leave, European Union, vote, and trade. The specific concerns during periods of heightened uncertainty have clearly changed over time.  Figure 3. Word clouds in Minutes during periods of increased mentions of uncertainty These various aspects and manifestations of uncertainty are impossible to capture in a single data series. Therefore, the Bank of England has focused on a measure of uncertainty that is a principal component drawn from eight different measures of uncertainty. This measure is described in detail in Haddow et al. (2013). It draws from financial market data, survey data, and media citations, and is therefore able to capture several different types of uncertainty. First is uncertainty in households, measured in the GfK unemployment expectations balance and GfK financial situation expectations balance. Second is uncertainty in firms, measured in the CBI survey and IBES dispersion of company earnings' forecasts. Third is uncertainty in the whole economy, measured by FTSE option-implied volatility, sterling option-implied volatility, the dispersion of consensus forecasts for annual GDP growth, and the number of press articles citing uncertainty.  Figure 4a graphs this uncertainty indicator at a monthly basis since 1991. The principal component is the solid line, and the grey swathe captures the range of the underlying measures. Uncertainty recently spiked upwards - from one standard deviation below its historic average in the middle of 2015 to two standard deviations above its historic average immediately after the referendum on EU membership. There are only 3 other times when uncertainty reached as high a level as after the referendum: during the 2008-9 financial crisis, during the period of heightened concern about the euro area at the end of 2011, and after the UK left the ERM and sterling was devalued in 1992. This uncertainty measure has recently declined somewhat in August and September, but increased again in October to still remain above its historic average. a. Principal component indicator b. Individual uncertainty indicators What is driving these recent movements in uncertainty? The shaded swathe in Figure 4a shows that at least one measure of uncertainty used to form the principal component has reached a record high since the start of the series. Could changes in certain types of uncertainty have different effects on the economy than others? To better understand these dynamics, Figure 4b begins by graphing the 6 monthly measures of uncertainty used to construct the principal component. It shows that some measures of uncertainty have been relatively stable and are below their historic averages, including the measures focused on household uncertainty (based on the GfK expectations balances). Other measures, however, have increased sharply and remain well above their historic averages, especially those measuring broader economic uncertainty (media citations of uncertainty, sterling volatility, and the dispersion of GDP growth forecasts). This graph  highlights, yet again, the challenge of capturing such a multifaceted concept as uncertainty in any individual data series; different measures of uncertainty can move in starkly different directions at the same time. Figure 5 confirms this point by showing the correlation between different quarterly measures of uncertainty. It includes the BoE principal component measure, its underlying 8 data series, and three additional popular U.S. stock market volatility). Each cell is coded by colour, with blue indicating a positive correlation, red indicating a negative correlation, and darker cells indicating stronger correlations (with either sign). The correlations across many of these measures are very low - averaging 0.36 for the full matrix. The measure of geopolitical risk stands out as having particularly low correlations with the other measures (even moving in opposite directions in some cases). Figure 5. Correlation of selected uncertainty measures The BoE principal component has some of the strongest correlations - which is not surprising as it is constructed based on most of these measures. The BoE principal component is most correlated with: sterling volatility, the GFK measure of unemployment uncertainty, the dispersion of IBES earnings forecasts, and the CBI measure of business uncertainty. This suggests that the principal component may have an advantage over other measures by better capturing various dimensions of uncertainty - including differential effects for households, companies, financial markets and the broader economy. This measure would be more likely to capture the very different forms of uncertainty captured in the word clouds in Figure 3.  Even more important than assessing how the different forms of uncertainty move together is understanding how they move with the broader economy. For example, even if geopolitical uncertainty has little relationship with other measures of uncertainty, does it correspond more tightly to major changes in GDP growth? Are some forms of uncertainty more malignant while others benign? And do some measures of uncertainty primarily affect certain segments of the economy (such as businesses), but not others (such as households)? Figure 6: Channels by which uncertainty can affect the economy Reduces investment and productive capacity; larger effects for more irreversible investment; larger effects on investment in housing and export sector and savings Consumers reduce consumption and increase their buffer stock of savings; larger effects on spending for more durable and big-ticket items - especially housing; could also shift to less risky assets and therefore reduce pool of funds available for companies growth Reduces efficient allocation of resources across economy through a number of channels: (1) less expansion by productive firms as well as less contraction in less productive firms; (2) postponing entry and exit, especially into new markets and for startups; (3) shortening of supply chains as firms attempt to guarantee inputs and shift away from foreign suppliers market Firms reduce hiring, training, and wage growth; firms may shift to more temporary and less permanent workers; workers less likely to shift jobs and less job-to-job churn; could result in lower wages and worker productivity markets and credit conditions Greater volatility raises risk premia and cost of credit to businesses and households; banks have less incentive to provide loans to households and companies; credit conditions tighten most for startups and those without established relationships Before examining if different measures of uncertainty are more or less correlated with different measures of economic activity, however, it is useful to take a step back and think about how uncertainty might be expected to affect various segments of the economy. There is a voluminous literature on the various channels and relationships - a literature which I will not even attempt to survey. an overview of the key channels, as well as a selection of papers providing evidence. To simplify the discussion, I've focused on five channels through which uncertainty could affect the economy and that have received at least some empirical support: on investment, consumption and savings, productivity growth, labour markets, and financial markets (including credit conditions). Although the impact of uncertainty on  investment has received the most attention, and is believed to be the most important channel by which uncertainty influences the business cycle and broader economy, the figure highlights that uncertainty could have multifaceted effects on an economy through diverse channels. To assess the importance of these channels for uncertainty in the UK, as well as to better assess if different measures of uncertainty primarily affect different segments of the economy, Figure 7 looks at how uncertainty measures comove with different segments of the economy. More specifically, it reports the correlations between the 12 uncertainty measures (discussed in the last section) with different measures of economic activity, roughly categorized according to the various channels in Figure 6, but grouping the housing and labour market indicators together. The cells are colour coded using the same format as in Figure 5, with red indicating a negative correlation, blue indicating a positive correlation, and darker colours indicating stronger relationships (positive or negative). Figure 7 is a sea of different colours and shading, confirming that different measures of uncertainty seem to have different relationships with different measures of economic activity. Many of the different patterns are intuitive and support our understanding of the channels by which uncertainty works. There are, however, several points worth highlighting. First, the correlations between most measures of uncertainty and the different economic outcomes are generally negative (red) - confirming that higher uncertainty corresponds to weaker growth, investment, consumption, productivity, housing and commercial real estate markets, labour markets, and financial markets. The few positive (blue) correlations are also intuitive - such as higher uncertainty corresponding to higher savings and higher credit spreads. Most noteworthy are the consistently positive (and often strong) correlations between uncertainty and inflation. This suggests that some of the channels by which uncertainty affects the economy could work through reducing supply, as well as reducing demand. More specifically, higher uncertainty could reduce potential growth by reducing productivity growth (directly and through lower investment) and reducing employment and labour market churn (and therefore reducing the size of the labour force through hysteresis effects and the efficient allocation of labour). If uncertainty only reduced demand, but not supply, then it would be expected to generate spare capacity and be associated with a fall - instead of an increase - in inflation. If uncertainty is associated with a weakening of the supply-side of the economy, this could complicate the case for monetary policy to provide support to demand during periods of heightened uncertainty.  Figure 7. Correlations between measures of uncertainty and economic activity  Second, in terms of evaluating which measures of uncertainty are more tightly linked to movements in the economy, the Bank of England's principal component measure (which is the main measure of uncertainty used in MPC forecasts) does quite well. It has the strongest correlation with GDP and relatively darker cells for most economic measures and across different segments of the economy. The three individual uncertainty measures most correlated with GDP (other than the principal component) capture very different types of uncertainty: sterling volatility, unemployment uncertainty, and the dispersion of company earnings' forecasts. This confirms the point highlighted in the previous section; in order to capture the effects of uncertainty on the economy, it is important to directly measure different types of uncertainty - including in financial markets, on consumers, and on businesses. The BoE's principal component measure should accomplish this. Third, and in contrast, other uncertainty measures show a weaker relationship with key economic variables. For example, two popular measures of uncertainty used in academic research, the Economic Policy Caldara and Iacoviello, 2016), have weaker correlations with key economic variables, including GDP. In terms of the individual uncertainty measures used to construct the Bank of England's principal component, the uncertainty measures based on media citations, GDP growth forecast dispersions, and FTSE volatility have the lowest correlations with the economic variables, including with GDP. This agrees with results in et al. (2016), which finds that measures of uncertainty based on real economic data (such as dispersions in forecast errors) generate significant declines in real economic activity, while uncertainty measures based on stock market data or economic policy news, have no significant effect. This could also be important in assessing the recent impact of heightened uncertainty in the UK. Two of the main factors behind the sharp upward spike in the BoE uncertainty index has been the increase in media citations referring to uncertainty and the dispersion in GDP growth forecasts. If these measures have less impact on economic activity (as suggested in Figure 7), one might expect less drag on GDP from the recent increase in uncertainty than has traditionally occurred and when uncertainty increases due to other components. A final noteworthy pattern is the relative strength of the correlations between the different uncertainty measures and the different segments of the economy. Uncertainty measures seem to have some of the strongest links with the labour market (especially with hiring, quits, and job-to-job flows) and with the housing market (especially with prices for housing and CRE). The fact that many uncertainty measures have a weaker correlation with investment than many of the other variables is noteworthy, especially as the academic literature has focused on the negative effects of uncertainty on investment. Although the other channels have received some attention, they are generally not believed to be as large in magnitude or as important in explaining fluctuations in GDP. Yet, in the UK, uncertainty generally moves more closely with consumption (with a median correlation of -38% across all the measures) than with investment (with a median correlation of -19%). One possible explanation is that the effect of uncertainty on investment is more lagged, but the same analysis with uncertainty lagged by 1 or 2 quarters yields even lower correlations with investment. Another challenge is that these correlations do not capture causation, so that high correlations may not just capture how uncertainty affects that variable, but also how that variable affects uncertainty, or  how they both are simultaneously affected by a third variable. While all of these considerations could be important, the correlations still suggest that the effects of uncertainty on the economy may be more broadly based than generally believed, and occur through other important channels than investment. To further explore the dynamics of the effects of uncertainty on investment and consumption, as well as to evaluate the possibility of longer lags, I perform a simulation for the UK. I estimate the effects of uncertainty using a VAR model similar to that described in Haddow et al. (2013), and incorporate the estimated effects into COMPASS - the standard forecasting model used by the Bank of England. principal component measuring uncertainty increases by one standard deviation (about one-third of the increase that occurred from its recent trough to its post-referendum peak). I also assume that the exchange rate and monetary policy are unchanged. Figure 8a shows the resulting estimated effects on consumption and investment. The peak impact on both consumption and investment is lagged by several quarters, with the largest effect occurring a little over a year after the increase in uncertainty. The impact on consumption growth is estimated to be a small fraction of the impact on investment growth; two years after uncertainty increased, the fall in consumption is around 10% of the fall in investment. Next, Figure 8b uses the same simulation to estimate the impact on aggregate expenditure growth (the black line), broken into the three components on which it has the largest effect (consumption, investment, and Expenditure growth slows gradually, with a maximum drag of 0.5% qoq after 4 quarters. Weaker imports dampen some of the negative impact on output, while consumption and investment both drag significantly on growth. Most interesting, however, are the relative contributions of investment and consumption to slower expenditure growth. Even though uncertainty has a significantly greater effect on investment than consumption (as shown in Figure 8a), since consumption is a significantly greater share of aggregate expenditure than investment, the overall contribution of weaker consumption to the slowing in growth is very important and not far off that from investment. The drag on expenditure from consumption peaks at -0.25 pp, while that from investment peaks at -0.4 pp. To summarize, this closer look at how uncertainty is related to various segments of the economy has highlighted several key points. First, the effects of uncertainty are manifest in many ways and hard to capture in a single statistic that only focuses on one sector of the economy; there are advantages to using some type of index or principal component that captures these different aspects of uncertainty. Second, some indicators of uncertainty that have recently increased sharply (such as media references and the dispersion of GDP growth forecasts) tend to be less correlated with important economic indicators. Third, uncertainty can have meaningful effects on the economy through channels other than just investment - including significant effects through consumption. Finally, uncertainty not only reduces demand in an economy through numerous  channels, but can also reduce the supply potential of the economy. This implies that heightened uncertainty could lead to lower or higher inflation, therefore making the appropriate monetary response less clear-cut. Figure 8. The effect of an increase in uncertainty a. Consumption and Investment b. Contributions to GDP It is now time to move to the most important question related to uncertainty today - at least for someone tasked to set monetary policy in the UK - how will the recent increase in uncertainty around the UK's relationship with the European Union affect output and inflation? In order to answer this question, it is helpful to build on several insights from above. First, uncertainty should be measured using some type of broad index or principal component that captures its various manifestations - including uncertainty relevant to consumers and businesses. For this, the Bank of England's principal component measure seems better than any individual measures or any popular measures used in other research papers. Second, uncertainty can affect the economy through various related channels, and clearly in more ways than just reducing investment (including through consumption, productivity growth, the labour market and housing market). As a result, focusing on the aggregate effects on the economy, instead of trying to estimate each of these specific channels and then aggregating these individual estimates, seems a logical approach. Those were the easy decisions. Now the really hard work starts. In order to estimate the effect of heightened uncertainty on the broader economy, it is necessary to make three additional and critically important assumptions. First - how will uncertainty evolve in the future? For example, will uncertainty increase or decrease from its current elevated level - especially after Article 50 is  invoked? Second, should we adjust our measure of uncertainty to put more weight on indicators that have stronger relationships with key economic variables? For example, should we put less weight on some of the measures of uncertainty included in our principal component that have recently spiked (such as media references to uncertainty and the dispersion in GDP growth forecasts) but have weak relationships with GDP? Finally, saving the hardest for last, how does one identify the impact of uncertainty? For example, if past increases in uncertainty correspond to tighter credit conditions, is it possible to isolate the impact of heightened uncertainty when it does not correspond to tighter credit conditions? This section will take each of these questions in turn. It will show that each of these assumptions is critically important for the economic forecast and monetary policy. The answers to the last two questions may also explain why heightened uncertainty around the time of the referendum on EU membership has had less impact on the broader economy, to date, than expected given past relationships. To begin, Figure 9 shows the MPC forecasts for GDP growth (panel a) and CPI inflation (panel b) from the This forecast incorporates the impact of uncertainty as measured by the BoE principal component. Uncertainty is assumed to remain elevated through the forecast period, weighing on both supply and demand. Annual GDP growth is expected to slow to a trough of 1.2% by the end of next year, and CPI inflation pick up to a peak of 2.8% in mid-2018. What would happen if uncertainty followed a different path? To see how this one change might affect the forecast, I consider scenarios with higher and lower uncertainty paths (as compared to the path assumed in the November forecast), as well as a scenario with a delayed increase in uncertainty. In the higher uncertainty scenario (in blue), uncertainty picks up much more sharply than currently expected and then falls back slowly to end the forecast period one standard deviation higher than in the baseline scenario. In the lower uncertainty scenario (in green), uncertainty falls gradually over the rest of this year to its historic average of 0, and ends the forecast one standard deviation lower than in the baseline scenario. In the delayed uncertainty scenario (in purple), uncertainty remains at its current level through May 2017, then increases gradually for about a year, before falling back towards 1 standard deviation by the end of the forecast horizon (and ending exactly in the middle of the higher and lower uncertainty scenarios). The resulting paths for output under these three scenarios are shown next to the baseline forecast in Figure 9a. Annual growth falls by significantly more in the high uncertainty scenario - troughing at almost 0.6% instead of 1.2%. Growth falls more moderately in the low uncertainty scenario, never reaching as low as 1.5%. In the delayed uncertainty scenario, growth falls more gradually, but is still only 1.3% after 2 years, which is below the higher uncertainty scenario. These scenarios show that assumptions about the path for  uncertainty could have first-order effects on the path for growth, and therefore for unemployment and the size of any output gap. Figure 9.

5778,r161221a_BOE,united kingdom,2016-12-21,Increasing the relevance of Internal Audit,brown,0,"Good morning everyone. Firstly, may I say how grateful I am to the IMF and Hawkamah for inviting me to this conference. Before I joined the central bank community in 2005 I was lucky enough to have travelled a little as an internal auditor for American investment banks. Yet somehow I never before made it to the Middle East. So it really is a special honour for me to be here with you today in Dubai. I'd like to talk about the relevance of Internal Audit under five headings: 1. the state of Internal Audit in commercial banks during the financial crisis; 2. subsequent changes to the relevant supervisory and professional landscape; 3. whether those changes have made any difference to the standards of internal auditing; 4. whether central banks and supervisors - and their own internal auditors - might be able to drive further improvement; and 5. as part of answering the last question, the independence of Internal Audit. To the extent that this talk is biased towards banking in the UK it is because quite a lot has been going on in that space which I think may be of interest to you. I fully appreciate and applaud the fact that much has been done in other industries and jurisdictions. 1. The state of Internal Audit in commercial banks as the financial crisis developed Many people agree that the financial crisis started on 9 August 2007 when asset backed markets suddenly seized up. I can remember the day quite well. I was on holiday and spent two hours in the middle of a field trying to get a phone signal as I attempted to find out what on earth was going on. Opinion as to when the financial crisis ended is more mixed. The Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee judged on 1 December 2015 that ""the financial system has moved out of the post crisis period"". Others have cited the US Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates later in the same month as clear evidence that the crisis was over. Using these dates I've managed to work out that the exact middle of the financial crisis was 9 2011. You may suspect that I am trying to contrive something - you are absolutely right!  Well, it so happens, that October 2011 was also when I had the opportunity to look at a draft paper called ""The internal audit function in banks."" It had been prepared by the Audit Sub-Group, of the Accounting Task assess the effectiveness of the internal audit functions in banks. During a conference call with the Chair and Secretary of the sub-group, I pointed out that the draft paper made no reference to the financial crisis. I thought that was strange given that a number of banks around the world had gone bust and that many others had been (or remained) on some form of life support. The response from the secretary of the group, Xavier-Yves Zanota, ""...that's true Stephen but what has the failure of these banks got to do with their internal auditors?"" So here, in the middle of the financial crisis, was a representative of the world's most senior supervisory group telling me that, in his opinion, the failure of many of the world's commercial banks had nothing to do with their internal auditors. In other words the internal auditors were irrelevant! Now you might expect that the internal auditors within commercial banks would have been angered at this suggestion. But on the contrary, whenever I discussed the matter with them, they took it quite well! I must confess that, at the time, I found this rather irritating. But as I've reflected on it over the years I've realised that the reaction of the internal auditors was entirely logical. They said to themselves: ""My bank is bust; or would be bust without state support. In this litigious society, shall I: a) put my head above the parapet and declare that perhaps I could have done better; or b) go along with what seems to be the predominant view that it's nothing to do with me?"" The internal auditors thought long and hard about that question for at least a couple of seconds before going for option b). The truth is that the internal auditors in commercial banks were (quite understandably) hiding. And I suspect that all of us in this room would have done exactly the same thing if we had been in their shoes. ""Where were they hiding?"" you may ask. I think it was at least partly behind the Institute of Internal Auditor's  Let me remind you of what it was and still is ""Internal auditing is an independent, objective assurance and consulting activity designed to add value and improve an organization's operations. It helps an organization accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk management, control, and governance processes."" Over the many years that I've been an internal auditor, I've attempted to use this definition to explain to my children what it is that I do all day . And since this is the definition of internal auditing still used all over the world perhaps we should spend a little time on it. Presumably the first sentence is the most important so let's focus on that. Boiling it down, we get: Internal audit is an and function ""designed to add value"" and ""improve an organization's operations"". And analysing that we have: assurance A positive declaration intended to give confidence Well, I suppose that's OK if everything in the company is going just fine. But if that's the case, then I'm not sure we need internal auditors. And the truth is that my children never really liked the word consulting "". The dictionary defines this as: Experts making recommendations Well the good news is that the children can understand that. But then they would ask me tough questions like - ""well Daddy if you are such an expert at investment banking, why aren't you doing  investment banking and making lots of money!"" To be honest, I'm not at all sure that internal auditors are experts in the areas they are auditing. And then my children would ask ""what happens if people disagree with your recommendations"". The problem with the word ""recommendation"" is that it implies that whoever is in receipt of the auditor's idea for improving things can ignore it. I'm not sure that's right either (a point that I will return to later). designed to add value "" didn't really help me to distinguish the internal auditors from anyone else - ""Daddy, is there anyone in your company whose job is not to add value?"" my children would ask sarcastically. And finally, internal auditors are meant to "" improve an organization's operations "". OK, now we're getting somewhere. That's got to be worth having and it's certainly something the children can understand. But the trouble with this as a purpose for Internal Audit is that it is entirely possible to go around making marginal improvements whilst an organisation teeters on (and in the case of some banks during the crisis, fall over) the edge of a cliff! The truth is that the definition of internal auditing is rather ambiguous to say the very least. Quite good for hiding behind. Having carefully analysed the definition of internal auditing, I found myself reluctantly agreeing with Xavier. Incredible though it may seem, the dire situation that banks found themselves in during the financial crisis really was nothing to do with their internal auditors! Whether this was a satisfactory state of affairs is another question entirely. 2. Changes to the supervisory, legislative and professional regimes since then In October 2011, it was difficult to see how Internal Audit's lack of relevance was going to change for the better. The internal auditors were hiding, bank chief executives weren't exactly clamouring for greater internal challenge and audit committee chairs were defending the internal audit functions which they had been overseeing. The Institute of Internal Auditors seemed quite attached to its definition of internal auditing and the authorities had bigger things to worry about than the internal auditors. Other stakeholders - shareholders, depositors and taxpayers seemed generally unaware that internal auditors even existed!  Well, I'm pleased to say that as the financial system stabilised and the crisis ground into its second half, supervisors and legislators started to find the time to call out that the irrelevance of Internal Audit was not acceptable. For me, the turning point was 11 October 2011 when Andrew Bailey - at the time the Director of UK Banking Supervision - said in a speech: ""...internal audit functions of firms must be active and able to push their case strongly. To be frank, I think one of the relatively untold stories of the financial crisis concerns how little attention these functions have attracted. Boards and senior management [...] must be supported by robust [...] audit functions (internal and external). Unfortunately, when I look across the landscape, I don't believe that we are in the right place today in terms of the role and influence of these [...] functions."" Subsequently, the Basel Committee's Audit Sub-Group decided that it was important that their guidance ""incorporates lessons drawn from the recent financial crisis"" and they added a crucial word to their first principle for effective internal audit published in June 2012: ""Principle 1: An effective internal audit function [...] help[s] the board and senior management protect [my emphasis] their organisation and its reputation."" And the Institute of Internal Auditors - to their credit - responded to the prodding from supervisors. set up an independent committee which, in July 2013, issued a comprehensive ""Code"" for internal auditors in financial services. The Code raised expectations significantly. Its first paragraph says: ""1. The primary role of Internal Audit should be to help the Board and Executive Management to protect [my emphasis again] the assets, reputation and sustainability of the organisation."" The new Code, and particularly its emphasis on protecting the assets and reputation of the organisation, was warmly welcomed by the regulators.  And then, in July of 2015, the Global IIA adopted a brand new mission statement articulating what internal audit hopes to accomplish. The new mission is: protect [my emphasis yet again] organizational value by providing risk-based and objective assurance, advice, and insight."" This new mission applies globally and therefore, I assume, to all of the internal auditors present here today. In the quotations above, I have been emphasising the word "" protect "". I think it is a very important word for two reasons. Firstly, if we get to the point where internal audit functions start getting good at protecting their banks then that sounds like a useful thing for supervisors and other financial authorities like central banks. And secondly, I think it helps to resolve the ""irrelevance"" point. If the mission of an internal auditor is to ""protect"" the bank they work in then it seems to me that if the bank goes bust, at least someone will ask the question ""where on earth was the internal auditor"". That is absolutely not to assume that the internal auditor is responsible for the bank's failure. But the fact that the internal auditor now knows that the question will be asked, surely incentivises them to invest heavily in helping to prevent their bank from going bust in the first place. Standards published a 571 page report with the aim of restoring trust in UK banking. As you can imagine the scope of the report was very wide ranging and it covered internal audit in some depth. The ""internal audit have lacked the status to challenge front-line staff effectively"" Key among the many changes proposed by the Commission's report, and then adopted into legislation, was  ""ensure that the key responsibilities within banks are assigned to specific individuals, who are made fully and unambiguously aware of those responsibilities and made to understand that they will be held to account for how they carry them out."" The relevant legislation was enacted in 2013, and the new regime came into effect in March 2016. The Heads of Internal Audit at UK banks are now designated as one of a number of ""Senior Managers"" who must be approved by both financial regulators before taking up their position. The Head of Internal Audit has explicit responsibility for: ""management of the internal audit function of a firm and for reporting directly to the governing body of the firm on the internal audit function."" Perhaps you are thinking that that sounds a bit too easy? Well, on top of a host of other regulatory requirements, being a Senior Manager in the UK carries with it a number of special conduct obligations. These include making sure that the area you are responsible for is controlled effectively and complies with regulatory standards. You can only delegate your responsibilities to an 'appropriate person' and you must oversee that delegation effectively. And you must disclose appropriately any information of which the regulators would reasonably expect notice. To top it off, there is a new criminal offence of taking or agreeing to a decision (or failing to take reasonable steps to prevent a decision) that causes the failure of a UK bank. So, if the IIA's new mission - to protect organisational value - doesn't focus the mind of bank internal auditors then, in the UK at least, the prospect of seven years in prison (which is the maximum penalty for failing to take reasonable steps to prevent a decision that results in the failure of a Bank) surely will! 3. Have these changes made any difference to the standards of internal auditing in the UK? Well, there have not been any bank failures in the UK since the above reforms. Despite being a strong advocate for the Internal Audit profession I'm not sure the internal auditors can claim the credit for that! But there is no doubt that the new guidance and its emphasis on ""protecting"" the organisation has, along with supervisory pressure and the new Senior Managers Regime, prompted some real improvement within the internal audit functions of the UK's commercial banks. According to my supervisory colleagues:  access to key information and attendance at key governance forums is much improved; Internal Audit's reporting lines have been adjusted to better preserve their independence - it is now much less likely that Internal Audit reports to Finance or Risk; and resourcing (in terms of overall headcount) appears to have increased generally across the industry. This is good news. But, it is equally clear that there is further to go. In particular: Internal Audit needs to stand its ground more; it needs to invest in developing talented internal auditors who can go ""toe-to-toe"" with senior management on key issues; internal audit reports should be more concise and more readable and focus on the key risks to the business; internal auditors should be more forward looking and focus more on ""emerging risks""; and internal audit departments need to invest more in quality assurance and in challenging themselves. And it is these opportunities which bring me to the real point of this talk. 4. How can central banks and supervisors - and their own internal auditors - drive further As a supervisory body we, at the Bank of England, think it is in our interests for banks to have effective internal audit functions that help to protect the assets and reputations of the organisations they work for. And we think that the internal audit profession in the UK is making real progress towards this. But we also know that Internal Audit has further to go and that we are operating in an international marketplace with interconnected global companies. And, just as importantly, Internal Auditing itself is very much a global profession. With respect to improving professional standards, there are limits to what any of the 39 central banks represented here today can achieve by themselves.  So I am hoping that each of you, the central banks here today, will consider demanding more of the internal auditors within your own financial services industries. I have no doubt that central banks are influential enough to be able to do this irrespective of whether or not they are directly responsible for supervision. I know that some of you are already doing this and that some of you may be further along this path than we are in the UK. But I think it is also likely that the internal audit functions in your financial services sector, just like ours, still have some distance to travel. I trust, therefore, that it is not controversial to suggest that your central banks should push to raise Internal Audit standards within your financial services sector. But may I also suggest that the internal auditors within your central banks and supervisory authorities could help with this. Over a third of us here today are central bank internal auditors, so perhaps I could expand on this a little and explain why it might be a more controversial suggestion. I think that in the field of Internal Auditing, the subject matter experts in your central banks are likely to be your very own internal auditors. If that is the case then surely it should be possible to leverage that expertise for the greater good. And yet, in my experience, it is not common for the internal auditors in central banks to proactively and forcefully engage with the internal audit profession in their countries to demand higher standards. Why is this? I hear two reasons from central bank internal auditors; both of which I understand but both of which I disagree with: The first reason goes along the lines of: ""I am an active member of my local IIA but I avoid speaking about internal audit standards in financial services in case I encroach on the territory of the supervisors and possibly even contradict them"". I think that this potential problem can be easily solved. All that is needed is extensive communication and collaboration with the supervisors (and any other policy makers) to avoid such contradictions. If only it were as easy as that! The truth is that this then often prompts the second reason: ""I cannot collaborate with the supervisors in the way that you suggest because I am meant to be auditing them - I am meant to be completely independent of them."" Now this is much harder to deal with. And independence is such an important topic for internal auditors that I hope you can forgive me for saying a few words about it.  Let me be clear that I think that the need for internal auditors to maintain their objectivity - their impartiality - is of paramount importance. If the readers of internal audit reports, or the recipients of their ""recommendations"", start to question the internal auditor's motives, then all is lost. Internal auditors must be independent of executive management. But, they are certainly not independent of the organisations that they work for. They are very much a part of the organisation and, I hope, striving to protect it. Internal auditors, unlike consultants, external auditors or supervisors, are - as the name suggests - ""internal"" to the organisation. I think that it is from this unique combination of being part of the organisation and yet independent of executive management, that internal auditors derive their ability to help protect the organisation. This combination is, in fact, Internal Audit's unique selling point or USP. Being independent of executive management means that the internal auditors don't report to executive management. It means resisting being unduly influenced by them. It means asking them challenging but constructive questions. It doesn't mean that the internal auditor cannot work with or collaborate with executive management. Perhaps I can give you two examples which illustrate how the concept of Internal Audit independence can sometimes be misconstrued or even misused. Wherever I have worked as an internal auditor, I've always attended and spoken at the meetings of the boards overseeing the organisation's most risky projects. I've sometimes encountered executives who have suggested that it would be far better if I did not attend so that I can ""maintain my independence"" from the project. I advise them that it is far better that I am inside the room so that I can leverage my independence . Sometimes they say ""but who will conduct the investigation if the project goes disastrously wrong?"" The answer is ""certainly not me - I've been too close to the project. But, since my job is to help protect the organisation, I will try to help you and the organisation avoid that disastrous outcome!""  Example 2: Negotiating management actions in response to audit recommendations Another area in which the independence of internal auditors is sometimes misunderstood is when negotiating management actions in response to internal audit ""recommendations"". I suggested earlier that the word ""recommendation"" feels rather too optional to me. I admit though that in the absence of a better word in the English language I still use ""recommendation"". However, rejecting an internal audit ""recommendation"" should be anything but a free option for executive management. Internal auditors need to be able, as my supervisory colleague said, to stand toe to toe with management and negotiate cost effective action plans to address the issues that have been identified. If agreement cannot be reached the matter should be escalated, ultimately to the Audit Committee of the Board, and it should be clear that management and the internal auditor disagree about the correct course of action. If there has been a robust and respectful negotiation, then such an escalation should be very rare. This may sound obvious. But there are some internal auditors who avoid these tough negotiations, citing independence. They say ""it's my job to point out the weaknesses; it's management's job to come up with the solutions. I will compromise my independence if I start to discuss the solutions with management. But I'll come back in two years and check that the issues have been addressed."" I'm afraid that such an approach makes it far too easy for the internal auditors to be ignored. And from there it is a short step to irrelevance. So, to summarise, I think that whilst independence from management is of paramount importance to internal auditors, maintaining independence does not preclude working with management. Indeed, to be effective, internal auditors must work with management. I do realise that there are shades of grey here and that internal auditors have to balance staying informed with the need to keep a healthy distance from running the company. Doing this, whilst ruthlessly maintaining independence, is part of the internal auditor's art. All of which brings me back to the discussion about whether or not the internal auditors in your central banks are able to collaborate with supervisors and exert influence over the IIA and other internal audit practitioners in your country in the interests of raising standards in Internal Auditing. I hope that I have convinced you that they can. And that therefore they should.  available at available at available at available at available at available at , 'The internal audit function in banks' available at available at available at available at , 'Changing banking for good' available at , 'A review of corporate governance in UK banks and other financial industry entities - Final Recommendations' available at available at available 'Internal Audit and supervisory expectations - building on progress'.

5828,r171006b_BOE,united kingdom,2017-10-06,Keeping up with fast markets,salmon,0,"Good morning and welcome to the second day of our conference. Yesterday we heard from Richard Payne's session on the subject of algorithmic trading - a key development in market structure, enabled by the greater prevalence of electronic trading. This morning I want to step back a little further and look at the broader implications of the moves toward more electronic and automated trading. One phenomenon this has given rise to - and perhaps the element which has most captured the public imagination - is the series of 'flash' events which have occurred over recent years (Chart 1). The 2010 flash crash in US equities was the first such episode to generate headlines outside the industry. Four years later, in 2014, we saw something similar in the US treasury market, the most liquid bond market in the world. Closer to home, shortly after midnight in London on 7 October last year, the bid for sterling momentarily evaporated, with the currency falling nearly 10% against the US dollar before quickly reversing (Chart 2). This was a rare example of a flash event involving such a major, liquid, currency pair, and occurred during a G20 meeting in Washington DC, prompting our Governors to swiftly make contact with the Bank's London dealing desk for an explanation. They say markets never sleep; neither did our staff on that particular night! In these episodes, prices moved sharply, before largely reversing - all within a matter of minutes, and to a degree that far exceeded changes in market participants' perceptions of economic fundamentals. Of course, sharp movements in asset prices are nothing new in themselves. Just look at the tulip mania ending in 1637, and the equity crashes of 1929, 1987, and the bursting of the dot-com bubble in 2000. What is new is the speed, and the typical near-total reversal. And the Bank's responsibilities for monetary and financial stability make it incumbent on us to keep up. What is clear is that flash crashes are likely just one symptom of material changes in the structure of certain markets and the nature of their participants. Although these changes are ongoing, we need to understand them and their drivers, if we are to succeed in correctly identifying any implications for financial stability. One should be wary of over-generalisation, particularly with an audience such as this, given the substantial diversity in markets across both product types and geography. I would nonetheless characterise the broad trends of the past few decades as follows: Firstly, there has been an increase in electronic trading across most markets. This is particularly the case in markets for inherently liquid instruments - i.e. those which are simple and homogenous, such as equities  Second, at least initially, the migration from voice to electronic trading has allowed for far greater transparency around the prices at which market participants are both willing, and able, to transact. This in turn has given rise to a plethora of new data, which combined with advances in technology, has led to the growth of algorithmic trading, including that at high frequency (Chart 4). And, for the purposes of this speech, by 'fast markets' I mean those markets where these trends have gone furthest: most obviously major equity, foreign exchange (FX) and futures markets. In these markets, there is less need for intermediaries to warehouse risk, due to the inherent liquidity characteristics that attract a wide range of participants, making it easier to find a near-instant match between buyers and sellers. This has allowed the emergence of new technology-focused, smaller, non-bank, market participants that specialise in using algorithms to execute and route orders at high speed. Chief amongst these are principal trading firms (PTFs), who trade on a proprietary basis, using sophisticated technology (Chart 5). Importantly, some PTF firms have been able to make markets at lower marginal cost than other participants, including by closing positions or offsetting risk in correlated instruments in shorter time frames. These competitive pressures have been one factor prompting many banks to warehouse less risk in fast markets, changing their business model to act as agents who sit between end-users and PTFs and the remaining, typically large, bank market-makers. To differing degrees across markets, regulation has also played a role in encouraging such activity. In US equity markets, for example, Regulation National Markets System (2005) required brokers to execute client orders at the best price offered electronically on any venue, leading to fleeting arbitrage opportunities for the fastest moving market participants. In Europe in 2007, MiFID laid the groundwork for more competition, leading to different types of trading venues and more market fragmentation, also contributing to the growth of high-frequency trading. And this regulatory influence will continue, with MiFID II set to introduce a whole host of new rules which bear on fast markets. As Governor Carney has often stressed, central banks care deeply about the operation of financial markets. For the purposes of this speech, I will examine the implications of these developments through two prisms: market efficiency and market resilience.  Fast markets and market efficiency There is much evidence that these developments have improved the day-to-day liquidity and efficiency of these markets ; that is, the degree to which participants are able to transact in reasonable size in a timely manner, at or close to prevailing prices - giving rise to prices that accurately reflect market participants' aggregate view of asset values. Empirical research has found that, on average, the presence of high-frequency traders has been associated with improved headline measures of liquidity, at least for trading in small size. There are two reasons why this might be the case. First, as mentioned above, because automated traders are able to achieve low operating costs per transaction, they are able to charge a narrower bid-ask spread as compensation for providing market making services (Chart 6). Second, their speed allows them to update or cancel their (limit) orders quickly as news arrives, meaning their quotes are less likely to be stale when they are executed There is also evidence to suggest the presence of high frequency trading can improve market efficiency. These are potentially important benefits. The ability to undertake transactions at - or close to - prices that reflect economic fundamentals facilitates the proper allocation of capital, as well as the management and transfer of risk. It also gives borrowers the confidence to plan, and savers to finance, productive investment. Efficient markets also allow for the transmission of monetary policy by allowing changes in policy interest rates to be reflected quickly across financial markets and assets. The rise in automated high-frequency trading has, however, also increased the incentive for market participants to protect information that could signal their trading intentions. This is to reduce the risk of being disadvantaged by trading with other - faster-moving - market participants, and thus receiving a worse price (a phenomenon sometimes referred to as 'slippage'). This strategic interaction has manifested itself in two observable trends. First, there has been a partial reversal in the trend toward greater price transparency I highlighted earlier. Market participants have embraced other forms of trading, which differ to traditional exchanges either by offering less price transparency and/or a narrower range of counterparties.  In equity markets, for example, there has been a shift away from trading on 'lit' exchanges market has moved more towards 'off-book' trading, where participants transact bilaterally, seeking not to reveal information on their trading intentions, and to dark venues , such as broker-crossing networks and some multi-lateral trading facilities. Meanwhile, FX markets have seen a move away from 'exchange-like' platforms toward trading methods offering a more restricted range of counterparties and/or offering visibility to participants on who they are trading with (Chart 9). The aim is to disclose less information to the broader market, while counterparty awareness allows monitoring of metrics such as fill ratios and market impact over time. Second, market participants' desire to avoid revealing information on their trading intentions and seek the best price has led them to split up large orders, including via the use of algorithms. This can be seen in a reduction in trade sizes (Chart 10), as well as an increase in the rate at which orders in some markets are updated or cancelled. Here at the Bank we want end-users to both benefit from and be confident in the effectiveness of financial markets. So whilst these behaviours are presumably rational - and cost-effective - for individual market participants, we are mindful that an aggregate reduction in transparency has the potential to hamper efficient price discovery. Moreover, the steps some participants are taking to conceal information raises questions about how the aggregate efficiency benefits from faster markets are shared. Finally, the occurrence of flash crashes indicates that, even if fast market prices are more efficient in general, they are not always so. Collectively, these observations suggest we should at least temper the headline conclusion that fast markets are more efficient: as is often the case, the story here is somewhat nuanced. Fast markets and market resilience I want to look now at the implications for resilience , both of individual firms and of markets - that is, whether they can function effectively in bad times as well as good. Again, fast markets may bring some important benefits. For example, because they place less reliance on risk warehousing by intermediaries, they were generally resilient during the 2008-09 financial crisis. Stresses were concentrated in those markets that had relied on dealer balance sheets: in our case the Bank of England introduced a 'market maker of last resort' scheme for corporate bond markets in 2009 to offset  the dysfunction in that market; the question of a similar intervention in equity or FX markets simply never arose. But fast markets, and associated changes in market structure, affect the nature and distribution of risks in ways we are only beginning to understand. Let me explore three examples: first, the implications of flash crashes; second, the changing distribution of risks across firms; and third the potential vulnerability of critical 'nodes' in fast markets. Implications of flash crashes Though flash crashes are headline grabbing, and occasionally sleep-denying, they have so far had limited systemic impact. These episodes have been short-lived, and prices have stabilised quickly. In some sense this is quite natural: a sharp movement in market prices exceeding that justified by fundamentals should present a highly profitable investment opportunity for the timely investor. While it is reasonable to draw comfort from the resilience of fast markets and the lack of spill-overs so far, it is important we recognise the limits of our understanding. Having been heavily involved in the analysis of sterling flash episode I am confident that we are able to study, which the Bank of England helped to author, demonstrates that ; as does the Joint Staff Report on the 2014 US Treasury flash rally. But I doubt we can fully understand what conditions may trigger similar future events or completely anticipate how they might unfold. Specifically, in my view, we are not yet in a position to rule out that future flash episodes might interact with aspects of financial market infrastructure in a way that gives rise to longer-lasting disruption. Suppose, for example, that a future flash episode happened to coincide with benchmark fixings in foreign exchange markets, or a margin call related to equity or derivative markets. The resulting impact on the recorded values of a range of assets might risk mechanically prompting further sales and price falls. The changing distribution of risks for individual firms Moving on to my second example, even in the absence of systemic spill-overs from flash episodes, fast markets alter the pattern of risks that individual market participants are exposed to. And there good grounds for concluding that more needs to be done to ensure market participants take account of this consistently.  Use of algorithms does not change the fundamental risks associated with trading in financial markets (e.g. market, counterparty and operational risks). But use of high-frequency trading algorithms does change their relative intensity and can materially increase the potential to build up significant intraday positions. This latter point is most obviously true for those bank and non-bank intermediaries that specialise in high- frequency trading. And though these firms should be expert in managing such risks, history shows this is not a given. Most famously, in August 2012, Knight Capital - a firm engaged in market making and at the time the largest trader in US equities - lost $460 million as a result of an undetected manual error in its algorithmic trading software. And in 2013, an error in a trading algorithm at HanMag Securities - a Korean brokerage firm - led it to place erroneous equity option trades, generating losses in excess of its capital. As I noted above, end-users - corporates and asset managers - are increasingly splitting up larger trades into smaller pieces and trading them over a longer period. Doing so exposes them to more execution risk; that is, the risk that prices move against them before they have finished transacting - which traditionally was more the preserve of intermediaries. Some end-users are also now automating this trading process through the use of algorithms. Indeed, a recent Greenwich Associates survey found 21% of institutional asset managers and 10% of corporates do so in foreign exchange markets. In so doing they swap one set of risks for another, and the examples of losses by specialist firms in periods of fast market turbulence cautions against assuming that all end-users will effectively manage the new risks associated with the use of algorithms. These risks can exist through indirect as well as direct exposure to developments in fast markets. Many intrinsically linked with less liquid underlying (slower market) instruments. ETFs clearly bring many business- as-usual benefits which market participants value - for example, the convenience of being able to transfer risk at high-frequency via standardised, exchange-traded securities in fast markets. There is a question, however, of how these interlinkages work in stress. During the turbulence of August 2015, for example, equity investors flocked to trade in exchange-traded funds, causing ETFs to appear to be priced at large discounts to the value of their - sometimes less liquid - underlying security (Chart 11). On this occasion, once again, the dislocation was short-lived. But if a future stress in fast markets - such as those for ETFs - were to persist for a longer period, it might spill over to cause stress in other linked markets, including for less liquid underlying instruments, including government or corporate bonds as well as equities, leading to wider implications for financial stability.  There is therefore a need to ensure that market participants' risk management frameworks keep pace with the speed at which these markets are capable of moving, taking into account the speed of possible shocks and the potential for propagation, including to slower markets. The potential vulnerability of critical nodes in fast markets Finally, it is unclear whether we yet fully understand how the migration towards fast markets has changed the nature or location of critical nodes within the system, and the risks to which they are exposed. Any intermediation model relies upon a particular infrastructure and has critical nodes. Traditional over-the- counter (OTC) markets, for example, are critically dependent on the willingness of dealers to warehouse risk in return for the informational advantage that seeing the flow provides. Such frictions have started to take new forms in fast markets. In particular at the same time as high- frequency trading activity has increased, a number of banks have stepped back from acting as market makers and have assumed a more infrastructural role. But new market participants still rely on banks to provide market access and extend them credit when engaging in algorithmic trading, through banks' prime brokerage and clearing businesses. Providing a competitive service to such technologically advanced clients - particularly those trading at very high frequency - requires substantial investment in technology and infrastructure, including that to facilitate the real-time monitoring of exposures and risk management. The costs associated with this are high, and serve as an effective barrier to entry. As few banks provide these services, this leads to a concentration of nodes of market access for short-term liquidity providers. The changing role of banks/dealers in fast markets prompts the question whether the nature of potentially disruptive risks is also changing. One obvious concern would be if a prime broker or clearing bank was paralysed, including for reasons unconnected to its activity in fast markets - say because of a cyber attack. I think it is fair to say that our understanding of how market functioning would respond in such a scenario - i.e. one in which a number of, in particular high-frequency, liquidity providers were denied market access - remains relatively limited. If there is a common theme across all three of my examples, it is the limits of our understanding. None of the points I have raised with regard to market resilience are wholly new. We at the Bank are following developments in the structure of these markets and their implications for financial stability closely, And as regulator both of many participants in electronic markets and some of those markets themselves, the Financial Conduct  Authority (FCA) too has remained deeply engaged and responsive to those developments which fall under its purview. Likewise, in none of these cases have I argued that there is a risk flashing red that requires an immediate response. Rather in the best traditions of central banking, my conclusion is that the authorities as a whole need to remain vigilant and deepen our understanding, so that we can take appropriate action in the future if required - be that from a macro-prudential or supervisory perspective. Looking to the future Financial markets are ever in a state of flux. In particular, the trend toward greater automation of trading - my focus today - looks certain to continue, both in already fast markets as well as those currently more reliant on traditional intermediation methods. Market participants have a clear interest here in understanding how risks to their businesses are evolving and in managing them prudently. For the authorities, we need to dig deep to understand what this means for the financial system as a whole: both to appreciate the benefits and to remain vigilant as to the risks. This remains very much in focus for the Bank and the FCA. It is important for us to ensure that regulation - both of individual participants, market infrastructure and the financial system as a whole - keeps pace with the changes in the type and distribution of risk. Only then can it provide an adequate guard against risks to prudentially regulated institutions and their counterparties. Regulation is most effective when informed by a rich and diverse set of research - and here we need help from the academic community. There is enormous potential for varied and interesting research in the area of fast markets. I have covered just some of the questions which seem to us to be particularly relevant at present - and as markets evolve no doubt new topics and questions will present themselves. I encourage those of you with an interest in this area to keep running with it -your input is of great value to us. Keeping up with fast markets isn't easy. But with your help I'm sure we can rise to the challenge of ensuring that fast markets are there to serve the real economy, both in good times and bad. Thank you.

5879,r180824a_BOE,united kingdom,2018-08-24,Market power and monetary policy,haldane,0,"The views expressed here are not necessarily those of the Bank of England or the Monetary Policy Silvana Tenreyro, Jan Vlieghe and Robert Zymek for their comments and contributions. This work contains statistical data from ONS which is Crown Copyright. The use of the ONS statistical data in this work does not imply the endorsement of the ONS in relation to the interpretation or analysis of the statistical data. This work uses research datasets which may not exactly reproduce   The topic for this panel is the link between developments in product markets and monetary policy. It is a great one. A lot of attention has been paid by central bankers over recent years to the relationship between labour markets and monetary policy (for example, Yellen (2014) and Constancio (2017)). And rightly so. The relationship between monetary policy and product markets has, by comparison, been the road less travelled. Labour markets have been subject to big structural shifts over recent years, including the secular fall in the degree of worker unionisation in a number of industries (for example, Schnabel (2013)), the emergence of the so-called ""gig economy"" (for example, Taylor (2017) and Katz and Krueger (2017)) and secular rise in the degree of globalisation and automation in the workplace (for example, Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2014) and Acemoglu and Restrepo (2018)). Each of these shifts has led to a change in employment patterns and tenures and in workers' bargaining power. These structural shifts have been used to help explain the secular fall in labour's share of national income and the recent weakness of wage growth across a number of advanced economies (for example, Dao et al They have also been used to justify potential shifts in the position and/or the slope of the Phillips curve (for example, Blanchard (2016) and Kuttner and Robinson (2010)). Each of these potentially has a bearing on the setting of monetary policy. Yet, over the same period, structural shifts in the product market have been no less profound. They include the emergence of highly-integrated global supply chains, increasing the degree of specialisation of product markets (Baldwin (2016)); the blossoming of companies benefitting from global network economies of scale et al (2017)); and the rapid emergence of e-commerce and The associated shifts in market power, too, might plausibly have altered some of the key macro-economic relationships in the economy (De Loecker and Eeckhout (2017)). They may have influenced the pricing and provision of goods and services in the economy and hence the Phillips curve. And they may have influenced the amount of investment and innovation undertaken by firms and hence the aggregate demand curve et al (2005)). They, too, might thus have a bearing on the setting of monetary policy. These structural shifts in product and labour markets may, in some cases, have had common cause. For example, network economies of scale and scope could potentially have increased some companies' market power both over their labour inputs (through monopsony effects) and product outputs (through monopoly effects). This could show up in both a falling labour and a rising profit share, with potential macro-economic implications for activity, costs and prices (Autor et al  To explore these issues, we start by discussing briefly recent empirical evidence on market power and its potential macro-economic explanations and implications. We then explore its effects on monetary policy, using counter-factual policy simulations and adaptations of a simple New Keynesian model. Taken together, this evidence suggests that an increase in market power and mark-ups could have potentially important consequences for the economy and policy. These are summarised, in stylised terms, in Figure 1. To the extent a secular rise in mark-ups reflects a set of trade-off inducing shocks, that would shift outwards causing the policy possibility frontier to rotate clockwise (B to C). And it may also potentially alter the optimal weights placed on output and inflation stabilisation by the policymaker, shifting the point of tangency between the policy possibility frontier and policymakers' loss function (C to D). Taken together, the net effect of increased market power could be a potentially significant rise in inflation (but less so output) variability, relative to the counterfactual case of stable and static mark-ups (A to D). As for monetary policy, the fact that these are trade-off inducing shock places limits on its stabilisation capacity. The (level and variability) of the optimal interest rate path is, as a result, less affected by increased market power, despite significant shifts in policy possibility frontiers and policymaker preferences. There are two ways in which the path of monetary policy might potentially be affected to a greater degree by increases in market power. When companies have a significant degree of market power, the level of output produced is likely to be below the social optimum, creating an incentive for monetary policy to try to offset that by running the economy hotter (""inflation bias""). And if market power lowered companies' investment rates, this could reduce the economy's neutral rate of interest. Neither, however, at present has a strong empirical basis. To the extent these channels do operate, they reinforce the institutional case for independent central banks charged with pursuing well-defined inflation targets. At the same time, actual inflation across advanced economies has of course been relatively low and stable over recent decades. So while the micro-economic evidence - a secular increase in mark-ups - is striking, it is not easily reconciled with the macro-economic evidence on measured inflation, including on the impact of mark-ups on inflation (for example, Smets and Wouters (2007)). Reconciliation of the two strands of evidence - micro and macro - means that some combination of the following would have to be true. First, the micro-economic firm-level evidence may not accurately describe how economy-wide mark-ups have evolved since the 1980s. Second, other macro-economic factors may have more than offset the impact of rising mark-ups on the behaviour of inflation. Third, the theoretical macro-economic framework we use here - a New Keynesian model with monopolistic competition - may not be appropriate to analyse firm-level changes in mark-ups. The apparent puzzle between the micro-economic and macro-economic evidence deserves further research, given its potential impact on inflation dynamics and monetary policy.  There is a rich micro-economic literature that assesses the impact of market power on pricing and other firm decisions (for example, Tirole (1988)). There has been rather less evidence linking the industrial organisation of firms to developments in the wider macro-economy. That has changed recently, with a number of papers exploring the empirical evolution of (firm, sectoral and national) measures of market power and their implications for the macro-economy (for example, De Loecker and Eeckhout (2017, 2018) and Diez et al Perhaps the simplest way of capturing market power is through measures of market concentration, such as accrues to the largest firms within an economy or sector). Evidence suggests that market concentration, measured either through HHIs or concentration ratios, may have increased in the US over recent decades, across a broad range of sectors (for example, Autor et al (2017)). This pattern is not uniform, however, with concentration among European companies showing no such trend (Gutierrez and Philippon (2018)). The evidence on industry concentration in the UK suggests it occupies a mid-Atlantic position. Chart 1 plots the turnover share of the largest 100 UK businesses since 1998 (i.e. concentration ratio). This ticks up in the lead-up to the financial crisis, although this pick-up is more modest than in the US, from 20% to around Concentration has flattened-off in the period since the crisis, however, in line with other European countries. Turning to measures of concentration within the financial services industry, the international pattern is somewhat more uniform. Chart 2 plots the largest five banks' share of total banking assets in the US, euro area and the UK. Levels of banking concentration started fairly high, averaging around 30%. They drifted further upwards in the run-up to the crisis, although this drift was again fairly modest. Since the crisis, however, measures of banking concentration have flat-lined and, in the UK, have fallen slightly. Concentration indices have their limitations, though, and need not always be associated with market power. Some firms may be able to exercise market power in setting prices even without having a large share of a market if, for example, there is brand loyalty. And in a world of differentiated products, concentration measures such as HHIs or concentration ratios no longer correlate closely with market power (Bresnahan (1989)). With non-homogenous goods and non-Cournot competition, a better measure of market power is often provided by firms' mark-ups - the ratio of their price to their marginal cost (De Loecker and Eeckhout (2018)). The larger the mark-up, the greater the degree of market power, whether at the firm, sector or national level. Mark-ups also have the benefit of being the relevant measure of market power in the workhorse models of the macro-economy used by policymakers.  In that spirit, a number of recent papers have estimated measures of mark-ups based on individual company accounts data. These cover a wide range of companies, sectors, countries and time periods (for example, et al (2018)). The findings from these studies are, in macro-economic terms, both quite striking and quite strikingly uniform in the broad trends they reveal. For example, De Loecker and Eeckhout (2018) have recently calculated mark-ups for around 70,000 firms across 134 countries over almost four decades. Since 1980, they estimate that the sales-weighted mark-up for the average firm across countries has risen by a remarkable 50 percentage points. Table 1 shows their mark-up measures for the G7 economies over the period. Though there is cross-country variation, average mark-ups have risen significantly in every G7 country, by between 30 and 150 percentage points. Taken at face value, the macro-economic implications of these shifts in mark-ups could be very large. The most direct and immediate impact would be on measured inflation rates. According to Table 1, mark-ups will have been adding, on average, over one percentage point each year to measured inflation rates across the G7 countries between 1980 and 2016, other things equal. As context, over the same period average G7 inflation rates have fallen by over 10 percentage points. A second potential macro-economic impact of higher mark-ups is on sales. Higher mark-ups will, other things equal, have pushed down on aggregate demand and generated a deadweight loss of consumer surplus (""Harberger triangle""). Baquee and Farhi (2018) estimate the size of this effect and find that eliminating mark-ups entirely would raise aggregate US total factor productivity (TFP) by as much as 35%. To better understand some of the drivers of higher mark-ups, it is useful to look at more granular data. Using a similar approach to De Loecker and Eeckhout (2017, 2018), we draw on data for around 3,500 unique UK-listed companies from the late-1980s to construct around 33,500 firm-year mark-up estimates. that methodology, Chart 3 plots a sales-weighted measure of mean mark-ups for UK-listed companies since 1987. It shows a striking rise, from 1.2 to around 1.6, over the period. This broadly mirrors international trends. Although they capture subtly different dimensions of market power, there is a weakly positive relationship between measures of mark-up and market concentration at the sector level (Chart 4), which is statistically  significant at the firm level. The same has been found among companies in other countries (Diez et al (2018)). This gives some degree of reassurance that the rise in measured market power has been a genuine one. If we slice the mark-up data for non-financial companies on a sectoral basis, this suggests this rise has been reasonably broad-based (Chart 5). All but two of the ten sectors have seen mark-ups rise since 1987, although some are volatile. Six of the ten have seen them rise by more than 30 percentage points. Among the largest rises have been in manufacturing (70 percentage points), professional, scientific and technical (62 percentage points) and transport and storage (57 percentage points). This broadly mirrors the international evidence. One apparent exception is the banking sector. Chart 6 plots a measure of banks' net interest margins (NIMs), as a proxy for mark-ups, in the UK, US and euro area since 1996. NIMs appear to have been broadly flat in these countries over recent decades. If anything, they may have fallen over the past decade. The latter is potentially the result of the low levels of official interest rates, constraining the ability of banks to lower their deposit rates in order to protect margins (for example, Claessens, Coleman and Donnelly (2017)). Another way of slicing the data is to ask how much of the rise in mark-ups is due to a compositional shift over time towards sectors whose mark-ups are already high and how much reflects a generalised rise in mark-ups within each sector. Chart 7 shows this decomposition for UK-listed firms. Compositional effects do not explain any of the rise in mark-ups in the UK; and even if we do the same exercise at the firm level, compositional shifts towards firms with high mark-ups cannot explain the rise. Rather, the rise in mark-ups appears to be reasonably generalised across sectors. Although relatively broadly-based across sectors, the rise in mark-ups need not necessarily be broadly based within sectors. One way of showing that is by looking at the evolution of the distribution of mark-ups over time (Chart 8). This suggests the increase in mark-ups is heavily concentrated in the upper tail of the distribution - companies whose mark-ups are in, say, the top quartile. Mark-ups among firms in this upper quartile of the distribution have, on average, increased by a remarkable 50 percentage points since 1987. By contrast, mark-ups among firms in the bottom three quartiles of the mark-up distribution have scarcely risen over the period. This distributional effect can also be seen from the large and widening gap between mean and median mark-ups (Chart 9). In 1987, this gap was 7 percentage points. By 2016, it had reached 44 percentage points. This strongly suggests that the rise in aggregate mark-ups over the past 30 years can largely be accounted for by a subset of high mark-up firms raising their mark-ups and/or market share.  This fattening of the upper tail of the mark-up distribution is not uniform across sectors. Chart 10 plots a measure of the skew of the mark-up distribution across different sectors over time. The fattening of the upper tail of the distribution is most pronounced in the ICT, transport and storage and manufacturing sectors, each of which is associated with higher average levels of mark-up. In understanding the characteristics of these firms, one revealing cut comes from taking into the account the extent to which UK-based firms' sales are domestic or foreign-focussed (Chart 11). While both categories have seen their mark-ups rise somewhat, this has been far larger among firms selling predominantly into foreign markets (almost 60 percentage points) than domestic markets (around 15 percentage points). Within that, this rise in mark-ups among foreign relative to domestic sales-focussed firms is largest in the manufacturing and ICT sectors. Taken together, this evidence is consistent with a story of rising mark-ups being concentrated among internationally-operating firms, who perhaps benefit disproportionately from global network economies of scale and scope. These firms tend to occupy the fat and fattening upper tail of the mark-up distribution. These are firms that might legitimately be termed ""superstars"" (Autor et al Given this diagnosis, what impact might the rise in mark-ups have had on the macro-economy? One aspect is what impact increased market power may have had on firms' incentives to invest and innovate and hence on firms' productivity. With investment and productivity each having under-performed over recent years, the relationship with market power has been subject to increased academic scrutiny recently (for example, The relationship between mark-ups and productivity is vital in understanding their macro-economic effects (Van Reenen (2018)). On the one hand, if highly productive 'superstar' firms, benefitting from network economies of scale and scope, have become more dominant, then higher mark-ups could be the side-effect of a positive supply shock in the economy. On the other hand, if mark-ups are the counterpart to increased market power and reduced competitive pressures, that would suggest a negative supply shock. These effects are not mutually exclusive. For example, Aghion et al (2005) develop a model which generates a concave relationship between competition and investment. Within some range, increased market power raises rents and acts as a spur to investment, innovation and productivity. But beyond a point, those forces go into reverse. Market power is associated with a fall in innovation and investment incentives, with knock-on negative effects for productivity. There is some empirical support for such a relationship. Jones and Philippon (2016) and Gutierrez and Philippon (2017) suggest increased market power may have reduced investment among US companies.  De Loecker and Eeckhout (2017) document a negative relationship between mark-ups and the capital share among global companies. And Diez et al (2018) identify empirically a concave relationship between mark-ups and investment, in line with Aghion et al We can re-run the Diez et al (2018) investment equations using the panel of UK-listed firms. This also finds a concave relationship with mark-ups (Table 2, column 1). The same relationship holds between mark-ups firms with mark-ups above around two tend to be associated with lower investment rates, in line with Diez et al . With estimated firm-level mark-ups having risen secularly in a number of countries, this is potentially a cause for concern. It is important, however, not to overstate the likely impact of this rise in mark-ups on aggregate investment, innovation and productivity. The rise in mean mark-ups in the UK over the past 30 years would still leave them below the levels at which investment rates start falling. The same is true among global firms. Indeed, among our panel of UK-listed companies, the shift in average UK mark-ups since the late-1980s would, using the estimated investment equation, be expected to have raised average investment rates by around 1 percentage point. Finally, there is the question of whether any potential negative effects of increased market power on investment and R&D translate into a negative effect on productivity. Evidence suggests there could be an effect. De Loecker and Eeckhout (2017) argue that, once account is taken of the rise in mark-ups, it is possible to account for the slowdown in US productivity growth after 1980. And Diez et al (2018) find that the greater the distance to the technological frontier, the lower a firm's investment - a ""reverse catch-up"" effect. If we look at the relationship between productivity and mark-ups across UK-listed firms, there is evidence of a positive relationship with TFP but no significant relationship with labour productivity (Table 2, columns 3 and 4). If anything the relationship with TFP may be convex, with higher mark-up firms being associated with proportionately higher levels of total factor productivity. There is some evidence of ""reverse catch-up"" effects, but only at high levels of mark-ups. Overall, then, while the theoretical and empirical evidence suggests it is possible higher market power and mark-ups may have come at some cost in lower investment and innovation, the evidence is not overwhelming and certainly would not imply that the aggregate effect is large. A second relationship explored recently is between market power and the labour share. et al find a negative empirical relationship using measures of market concentration among US companies. And et al (2018) and De Loecker and Eeckhout (2018) identify a weakly negative relationship between  mark-ups and the labour share. If we run regressions similar to those in Diez et al for UK-listed companies (Table 3), we also find a negative relationship between mark-ups and the labour share. The analysis presented here, and much of the recent literature, is based around estimates that suggest a secular rise in firm-level mark-ups. Some caution is advisable when drawing conclusions from these results. First, some macro-economic evidence points to falling , rather than rising, company mark-ups/margins (for example, Chen, Imbs and Scott (2009, 2004)). Second, some mismeasurement may be at play in the estimation of mark-ups (for example, Traina (2018)). These uncertainties in the measurement of mark-ups should be borne in mind in interpreting what follows. Having assessed some evidence on the evolution, and macro-economic implications, of increased mark-ups and market power, the next question is what implications these may have for the setting of monetary policy. This does not appear to have been an extensively examined area of research, whether among academics or policymakers. What follows is an initial exploration of some of the potential channels. One simple way of beginning to gauge how a rise in mark-ups might affect the economy and monetary policy is to simulate their impact using a macro-economic model. For this purpose, we model the economy using the Bank of England's in-house DSGE model, COMPASS. Monetary policy is assumed to follow a simple Taylor rule, with interest rate smoothing. The simulations are shown for a variety of different values of the relative weight policymakers place on output and inflation deviations from target in the Taylor rule. Chart 13 considers the impact on inflation, the output gap and monetary policy of a temporary mark-up shock that delivers a one percentage point increase in annual inflation. The dynamics of the economy are largely as we would expect following an adverse supply shock. The inflation rate rises, and real GDP usually contracts, in both cases temporarily. Although temporary, these disturbances are often material and always persistent, despite monetary policy acting to damp these fluctuations. The reason monetary policy struggles to damp these fluctuations is because a mark-up shock is trade-off inducing. Monetary policy is caught between loosening to return output to potential and tightening to return inflation to target. Which wins out depends, crucially, on the relative weight placed on these twin objectives in the policy rule. When inflation deviations are given greatest weight, monetary policy tightens materially. When output deviations are given greatest weight, monetary policy scarcely tightens at all.  With monetary policy facing this trade-off, it follows that an increased prevalence of mark-up shocks would leave policymakers somewhat constrained in their ability to smooth the economy. Put differently, a sequence of trade-off inducing mark-up shocks would tend to worsen the trade-off between output and inflation variability, for a given monetary policy rule. The ""Taylor curve"" frontier of policy possibilities would be expected to shift outwards. To illustrate that, we can conduct a counterfactual simulation of the effects of mark-up shocks on the course of output, inflation and interest rate variability. Chart 14 shows the variability of inflation and the output gap (the black dot) generated by the model. It also shows the variability of output and inflation when the economy is re-simulated having ""switched-off"" the shocks to firm mark-ups identified by the model (the red symbols). Policy is again assumed to follow a Taylor rule, with varying weights on output and inflation. Mark-up shocks have a material impact on output and especially inflation variability, even with monetary policy cushioning their effects. The variance of inflation is reduced by around a quarter, and variance of the output gap by around 10%, when mark-ups shocks are switched-off. The policy possibility frontier of output/inflation variabilities is shifted outwards materially by the presence of mark-up shocks. The scope for monetary policy to cushion these shocks is relatively limited. Chart 15 plots the variability of interest rates alongside output variability, for the same set of policy rules. Mark-ups shocks affect interest rate variability relatively modestly. And the variance of interest rates is reduced by only around 5% when mark-up shocks are switched-off. This tells us that trade-off inducing shocks to mark-ups leave the (path and variability) of interest rates less affected than inflation. Clearly, this simulation places an upper bound on this shift as it effectively removes shocks to mark-ups. In practice, the evidence on how the variability of mark-ups may have evolved is mixed. On the one hand, macro evidence suggests a fall in the variability of both output and inflation in many countries recently, a finding that has been attributed by some to a lower incidence of mark-up shocks (for example, Smets and et al (2017)). On the other, direct micro-level evidence on mark-up behaviour over recent years suggests a potential pick-up in their trend and variability. To the extent that the historical evidence is consistent with a sequence of larger mark-up shocks, it would be expected to have made the task of monetary policymakers somewhat harder. Both output and inflation will have deviated more significantly and persistently from their long-run values. And although interest rates will have been adjusted somewhat more often in response, the trade-off inducing nature of these shocks places constraints on the degree of stabilisation monetary policy can achieve.  The limitations of this simulation approach need also to be borne in mind. First, the simulations consider only the effects of temporary mark-up shocks, whereas in practice shocks may have been repeated and persistent, as well as large. Second, more fundamentally, these simulations take the underlying model of the economy as given - a strong, and probably unrealistic, assumption. The competitive structure of the product market is one of the ""deep parameters"" in most standard macro-economic models. So we would not expect the relationships embedded in those models necessarily to be invariant to a rise in market power and mark-ups. Nor do these models typically take into account any of the potentially macro-economic side-effects of a shift in market power - for example, on productivity. To explore those questions, we draw on the textbook New Keynesian model of the macro-economy, the type of which is often used to justify and assess the effects of flexible inflation targeting (Clarida et al Woodford (2003)). Specifically, we use the well-known textbook New Keynesian model in Gali (2008) to consider how changes in market power might affect the setting of monetary policy. We analyse the case where higher mark-ups are effectively the result of reduced competitive pressures, rather than the rise of highly productive 'superstar' firms. The model takes the following generic form: where is inflation, is the output gap, is the policy rate, while is a cost-push shock. The first equation is a New Keynesian Phillips curve, the second a forward-looking IS curve. This two-equation system contains three key structural parameters: the slope of the Phillips curve, ; the interest elasticity of demand, ; and the long-run neutral rate of interest, . We discuss in turn how each might potentially be affected by the degree of market power in product markets and higher mark-ups. Phillips curve In the New Keynesian model, firms operate in imperfectly competitive product markets defined by described by Chamberlin (1933), and formalised by Dixit and Stiglitz (1977), monopolistic competition is an environment in which a large number of firms each face a downward-sloping demand curve for their respective differentiated product. This typically takes the functional form:  is the demand for good , whose price is . and are the overall price level and aggregate demand at time , respectively, while is the elasticity of substitution between the monopolistically competitive products. Individual firms are assumed to be small enough that a price change by one firm has a negligible effect on the demand faced by other firms. By implication, there is no strategic interaction between firms. Firms can set prices above marginal costs because of a finite elasticity of substitution between individual goods in consumer preferences, regardless of the fact that their share of the total market is small. There are clear limitations of this product market formulation when addressing issues of market power. Market power, in this setting, is captured by the capacity of firms to charge prices in excess of marginal costs, rather than by their capacity to build-up ever-larger market shares. Market power means higher mark-ups, but not higher degrees of market concentration. Different competitive settings might generate quite different pricing behaviour and Phillips curves (for example, Rotemberg (1982)). In this setting, the monopolistically competitive firm maximises profits by setting its price ( ) as a mark-up over nominal marginal costs ( where is the mark-up defined in terms of the elasticity of substitution. This tells us a firm increases its mark-up as the demand for its good becomes more inelastic. That might arise for a variety of reasons. Customer loyalty or brand might be one reason. Network economies of scale and scope might be another. In either case, the implication is that prices are being set above (and sales below) their socially optimal value - that is to say, their value under perfect competition when price equals marginal cost ( tends towards infinity). When prices are sticky, firms set prices in a forward-looking manner to get as close as possible to the desired mark-up over time. The forward-looking Phillips curve in (1) summarises that price-setting behaviour in the economy at large. The slope of the Phillips-curve, , is a composite of deep structural parameters in the model. In the baseline specification in Gali (2008), the slope is:  is the degree of price stickiness, is the discount factor in household preferences, is the degree of decreasing returns to labour in production, is the inverse of the elasticity of labour supply with respect to real wages (holding marginal utility of consumption constant), and is the inverse of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution in consumption. Significantly, the elasticity of demand, , and hence the mark-up, , affect the slope of the Phillips curve. The higher the degree of market power and higher the mark-ups firms charge, the steeper the slope of the Phillips curve (or, equivalently, the smaller the sacrifice ratio). We can roughly gauge the scale of this effect by calibrating the model. Chart 16 looks at the relationship between the slope of the Phillips curve, and mark-ups, , for a given parameterisation of the model. The relationship is, as we expect, a positive one. As a thought experiment, consider the scale of increase in mark-ups seen by the average firm globally since 1980, from around 1.1 to around 1.6. Other things equal, this would be expected on this calibration to have steepened the slope of the Phillips curve from just under 0.1 to around 0.2. This is a significant change in the parameterisation of a key macro-economic relationship for the setting of monetary policy. One way of explaining the intuition behind this steepening of the Phillips Curve is that market power reduces the degree of strategic complementarity in price-setting. In a product market closer to perfect competition, firms will be reluctant to raise prices fearful that, with other prices in the economy sticky, demand would fall-away sharply. By reducing the elasticity of demand, market power reduces this risk and thus gives rise to greater flexibility in prices - and hence a lower sacrifice ratio (for example, Ball and Romer (1990)).

Thank you very much to Women in Banking and Finance (WIBF) for their invitation to speak today. I've had the pleasure of working alongside a number of WIBF colleagues recently in support of their anniversary celebrations this year. That has really brought home to me the great work that WIBF do under Vivienne's leadership, and, critically, the way that WIBF has successfully stayed at the forefront of the changing nature of the gender diversity debate over the past four decades. It is that changing nature of the debate about women in the workplace - and gender diversity more broadly - that I wanted to make the theme of my remarks today. I hope you'll indulge me if I start with a bit of history. The Bank of England, which celebrated its 325 anniversary last year, has a rich history and heritage. And that provides a fascinating take on the evolution of gender diversity in the workplace through the years. In 1694, when the Bank was founded, one of the very first decisions taken by the Bank's Court of Directors (its governing board) was to make a woman - Britannia - the new institution's corporate seal . The Bank of England was among the first institutions in the City to employ women, although it took a further 200 years for that to happen. In 1894, the Bank appointed Janet Hogarth - who had a first-class degree from Oxbridge - to set up a small women's unit charged with the menial role of note-sorting that was normally reserved for boys in their late teens. A small number of other female appointments followed Ms Hogarth's, albeit under strictly prescribed rules such as compulsory resignations upon marriage . How did it feel to be the first woman employed by the Bank - indeed one of the first women employed in the 'When I first went to went to the Bank of England in 1894, . . . . women in ordinary Banks were unheard of, and their introduction to the Bank of England, of all places, caused a mild sensation, not to mention a series of tiresome jokes about 'old' and 'young' ladies of Threadneedle Street . How tired one got of trying to smile at them!' Janet Hogarth might have been the first woman in history to wince inwardly at workplace banter in the City. She wasn't by any means the last.  Fast forward, and women in the Bank, and indeed in the City, became much less of a sensation. But gender stereotypes of course persisted. Those stereotypes were clearly in evidence in this archive shot of the Bank in 1955 (see Annex). The female typists. The male bosses checking in on their work. And, as was also the case with the City more broadly at that time, a resounding absence of ethnic diversity. The intersectionality between gender and race is something I will come back to in a moment. Time ticked on. In the 1990s we had the first female Chief Cashier signing our bank notes - we've had two more since - and the first female member of the Bank's Court. In the Noughties, we had our first female Deputy Governor in Rachel Lomax. And while we've not yet had a female Governor , when I look at the great female talent we're nurturing in the Bank - and indeed the great female talent that is being nurtured right across banking and finance - I'm confident that the day will not be too long in coming. For those of us within the Bank, the pace of change on gender diversity accelerated notably from 2013 with the appointment of Mark Carney as Governor. The Governor made diversity a central pillar of our strategy at the Bank, and led from the front with a very clear commitment to making progress. We were proud hosts, for example, of the launch of the Women in Finance Charter at the Bank's Threadneedle Street headquarters, a hugely important HM Treasury initiative which has put gender diversity firmly on the boardroom agenda. At the Bank, our focus on gender diversity does not only apply to our own people. Take the example of the steps we are taking to improve the diversity of our external engagement with market participants . And for our frontline responsibilities for the prudential supervision of banks, building societies, credit unions, and insurers, we have made it abundantly clear that we expect our regulated firms to consider diversity when recruiting board members. As Anna Sweeney, one of our most senior Bank of England supervisors, has put it: ""The lack of intellectual diversity, including the lack of gender, race and other diversity, we believe contributed to the severity of the financial crisis through confirmation bias"". The need to do more on gender diversity is not all about the numbers, but the numbers undoubtedly matter. And this snapshot from our last Annual Report (see Annex) illustrates how we are getting on. Since 2013, the proportion of women in senior management roles has almost doubled from 17% to a little above 30% . On our executive committee, which sits just below Deputy Governor level and is responsible for day to day management of the organisation, we are split pretty much 50/50 men and women. We've also seen our gender pay gap begin to narrow as progression of women into more senior ranks improves - our mean gender pay gap dropped by a percentage point to 20.2% last year.  Several factors have contributed to the progress we've made to date. Those include but are not limited to: a consistently supportive tone from the top; a pooled approach to appointments at senior level ; a sponsorship programme; and a strong commitment to flexible working. The latter is something that I have benefited from personally: I have worked part-time throughout my Bank career, and am currently one half of the Bank's first ever jobshare at Executive Director level. None of that is to suggest, of course, that we are under any illusions at the Bank about how much more work we have to do. There is no shortage of challenges ahead. But for all of us across the UK who are working hard to make further progress on gender diversity, it is sometimes worth a brief pause to consider how far, collectively, we have come. So what of the future? I want to finish by highlighting the importance of the two big 'Is' - intersectionality, and inclusion. I believe it's important that we don't allow the debate on gender diversity to become a narrow discussion about the promotion of white, middle-class women. Progress risks stalling unless we continue work to address the unique challenges that different groups of women face. To ignore those would be to ignore the important impact of intersectionality - for example, between gender and race, between gender and sexual orientation or between gender and neurodiversity. At the Bank, our fantastic employee networks - including our highly effective gender network (known as 'Women in the Bank') - work with senior management on a wide range of issues. And that includes on intersectionality. For example: Our work at the Bank has shown that our ethnic minority colleagues do not always find the Bank as inclusive an organisation as we would like. Aims of initiatives such as our sponsorship programme include tackling some of the barriers that colleagues face. And to help us make further progress on ethnic minority diversity and inclusion (male and female), we have recently established a BAME Task Force, supported at the very highest levels of the Bank. The Task Force is led by Deputy , its members include the three chairs of our ethnic minority network, and it reports regularly into our governing board (the Bank's Court of Directors).  Our thriving LGBT+ network is helping us - among other things - to understand more about the challenges that our female LGBT+ colleagues may experience in the workplace, as well as about how best to support colleagues who are transitioning gender or who identify as non-binary. Our recent 'Out and Proud' charter , our public commitment to fostering LGBT+ inclusion, is a signal of the importance of these issues to us as an organisation. We know that in society at large, autism and other aspects of neurodiversity are almost certainly underdiagnosed in women and girls, and frequently misunderstood . Understanding more about the challenges facing neurodiverse colleagues at work is among the areas where our disAbility network - and specialist workplace mentors - are helping us make progress. The Bank has for some time had a number of initiatives that speak to social mobility, such as our long-standing community work programme. But we want to do more here, and our signing of the is one illustration of our commitment. In the coming year, we want to invest in a more consistent approach to measuring socio-economic background, as well as to participate in an external research programme to understand better the interaction between social mobility and characteristics such as gender and race. How as leaders should we think about tackling the complex landscape that intersectionality brings? A large part of the solution lies in that that second 'I', inclusion. Ensuring diversity in the workplace is never, on its own, going to be enough. Our diverse and talented employees can only ever reach their full potential if our culture is inclusive. As the Governor has said: ""Inclusiveness unlocks the true value of an organisation's diversity"" . We all need to feel comfortable being ourselves in the workplace, and being valued and listened to for what we bring, rather than for our background or upbringing. In terms of how to build an inclusive culture, that is a whole summit in itself. But a personal reflection is that inclusion begins at home. We all have a responsibility, particularly as we progress in our careers, to think about how our own day to day actions and behaviours make others feel. And to broaden our minds by actively seeking out and listening to those with backgrounds and world views very different to our own. To conclude, for me a great example of how the gender diversity debate is changing - and how we are building a more inclusive approach across banking and finance - is the active participation of men in the gender diversity debate. Not only in encouraging and supporting female colleagues to join WIBF and attend  conferences like these. But, at least as importantly, taking an active role themselves, and it is great to see that in the programme here today.

5988,r200310a_BOE,united kingdom,2020-03-10,The ideal post-EU regulatory framework,saporta,0,"Banks are much more resilient. The PRA has authorised 18 new banks in the past five years, with further banks in the pipeline to be authorised. The role of non-banks and market-based finance has been growing. And digitalisation is transforming a number of financial services. In spite of these changes, the fundamental market failures that justify the need for prudential regulation remain. This is because financial firms can take actions that create ""negative externalities"" - jargon for someone making bets that hurt innocent bystanders when they go wrong. And in the case of ""systemic"" negative externalities they hurt the economy at large, as the Great Financial Crisis reminded us. Equally, these market failures need to be dealt with in a manner that does not introduce frictions that hurt innovation and long-term productivity and economic growth. Prudential regulation that deals effectively with these market failures has to be underpinned by an appropriate institutional structure: a set of clear responsibilities enshrined in law on who sets the objective for prudential regulation and how, who regulates, and where the details of prudential regulation should sit. But what is the ideal institutional structure that would allow us to update, change and simplify these This is a timely question. Less than a month and a half ago, the UK exited the EU. The implementation period is due to last until the end of this year. While we are in the implementation period, the Government and the regulators will continue to onshore any new financial regulations and standards coming from the EU that take effect this year. And at the end of the implementation period, the UK will be left with the same complex set of EU law and regulations onshored in a way that replicates the rather unique way the EU - as a supranational institution - the area of financial services. The technical detail of the prudential requirements will sit in a dispersed variety of places: primary legislation, a range of statutory instruments, on-shored binding technical standards, and PRA rules and guidance. This 'patchwork' naturally makes the framework difficult for firms to navigate - particularly smaller firms with more limited resources to devote to compliance. It is partly for that reason that the previous Chancellor Philip Hammond announced in the 2019 Spring Statement that HM Treasury will be reviewing the post-exit regulatory framework. This review will include 'the need to ensure financial stability is delivered through an effective regulatory framework, with the responsiveness necessary for a dynamic and open financial services sector and an appropriate level of democratic accountability'. The first stage of that review, focused on regulatory coordination, was launched in July 2019. Ultimately, the design of the post-EU regulatory framework will be for Parliament to decide in due course. Last year Sam Woods set out a set of principles to which any future UK regulatory framework should adhere. This speech builds on these principles to propose an ideal framework from the perspective of achieving the Bank of England's objectives. It then looks at whether the existing empirical evidence, including some new research carried out recently by colleagues in the Bank, supports the framework. Ideal features of the institutional structure of prudential regulation Sam Woods' six principles of regulation are shown in Figure 1. In building the framework, I start by mapping these principles to three ideal features of regulation also depicted in the Figure. The first feature is that the structure needs to have dynamism . By this, I mean adjustments made to regulation over time to incorporate updated international standards in a timely manner, including to adjust for any unintended consequences of regulation. For example if the international standards are not designed with certain business models in mind, to reflect the advance of new technologies and to reflect new risks and opportunities. I have spoken at length elsewhere about the benefits of dynamism, so will not dwell on this more here. The second feature the institutional structure should have is time consistency . Time consistency is perhaps best understood by describing its opposite, time inconsistency. Public policy suffers from time inconsistency when there is a conflict between a policymaker's short- term incentives and their long-term incentives. In the context of prudential regulation, over the long run, a policymaker wants to avoid financial crises. Robust prudential standards are the means of achieving this. In the short term, however, there may be benefits from weakening prudential standards. For instance, a government might benefit electorally from the resulting short-term boost to credit supply. There is empirical evidence for this happening in practice. But the long-term consequence of always acting on those short-term incentives is an unstable financial system. The benefits of time consistency have been long recognised in monetary policy. Finally, the structure will need to have legitimacy . To achieve this, the regulatory authority needs to be given a mandate. A mandate provides a regulator with legitimacy in two ways. First, it ensures there is democratic control over the shape of the regulatory regime; e.g., the objective or objectives of the prudential regulation, the types of firm in scope, the issues the regulator must have regard to in making policy. Second, it makes possible to hold the regulator into account. Figure 1: Links between the principles of 'stylish' regulation and ideal features of the institutional structure of prudential regulation Alternative models for the institutional structure There are broadly four alternative models for the institutional structure for prudential regulation. The first model is that prudential regulation is specified in primary legislation . The approach to prudential regulation that the EU takes is an example of this model since for example regulatory requirements are mostly specified in the Capital Requirements Regulation and Capital Requirements This means that many of the technical details that make up prudential regulation are included in legislation. This would include, for instance, the mathematical formulae used to calculate risk weights. This model provides legitimacy because the legislation in which the prudential regulation is set out has been passed by a parliament. It is also time consistent, because a deviation from regulatory standards would require a change to legislation. But it is unlikely to be very dynamic because the only way prudential regulation could be adjusted in response to an unintended consequence or new risk that has arisen is a change to the primary legislation, which takes time to happen. It typically takes nine months to issue a new PRA rule - with that time including policy development, cost benefit analysis, process for public consultation, and approval by the Prudential Regulation Committee. In contrast, the process for making changes to primary legislation in the UK - which includes debates in committees and both houses of Parliament - requires finding Parliamentary time for legislation, and then after Parliamentary time has been secured, takes longer than a year to complete. Finding Parliamentary time is not an easy task, especially if the purpose of legislation is carrying out technical amendments to financial services rules. Public officials need to compete for attention with all the other important public-policy issues that Parliament and government must deal with and if they do not find a Parliamentary slot or Parliament is dissolved for elections, the legislation gets delayed for the next Queen's speech. For example, over the past six months, such events have delayed the passage of a Bill that is necessary to implement the final elements of Basel 3 (so-called Basel 3.1). By contrast, the financial regulator's task is solely focussed on delivering and maintaining rules that are fit for purpose for their regulated sector only - there is no competition for other initiatives and the process and timetable provides certainty to industry. In a second model, prudential regulatory-setting powers could lie with government ministers . This model would be dynamic because the government would be able to adjust prudential regulation. It would be legitimate since the government is directly accountable to the parliament and ultimately the electorate. But it may not be time consistent because it creates the possibility that prudential regulation will be influenced unduly by the electoral cycle, as was deemed to have happened to monetary policy prior to central bank independence. Alternatively and in a third model, these powers could be given to an independent regulatory body . This model is likely to ensure that prudential regulation is both dynamic and time-consistent. An expert regulator would be able to identify and implement necessary dynamic adjustments, and, for reputation reasons, it would have an incentive to maintain prudential standards provided that it avoided industry capture. But, absent further accountability mechanisms to enhance it, it would lack legitimacy. In summary, each of these models lacks one of the ideal features for the institutional structure of prudential regulation. The fourth model is an independent regulatory body with a clear mandate set out in primary legislation and a clear set of accountability mechanisms to Parliament. This model combines the benefits of an expert regulator that can adjust prudential regulation dynamically, with an objective that incentivises it to maintain prudential standards, while using the mandate and the accountability mechanisms to ensure legitimacy. Table 1 summarises the degree to which these four models possess the three ideal features of an institutional structure of prudential regulation. In theory at least, this fourth model is preferable because, unlike the other models, it possesses all three of the ideal features. Table 1: Comparison of alternative models of the institutional structure of prudential regulation Primary legislation x Regulator + clear mandate mechanisms to Parliament There are plenty of precedents for this institutional structure of prudential regulation, including in the The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, better known as FSMA, established a regulator in the form of the FSA and specified the regulator's objectives and responsibilities. The detailed regulatory rules, however, were set out by the FSA in its handbook, not written into the Act. Following the financial crisis, the model for prudential regulation in the UK has been further developed (PRA). The mandates for both the FPC and PRA are set out in primary legislation: the FPC is responsible for protecting and enhancing the overall stability of the UK financial system; and the PRA's primary objectives are to promote the safety and soundness of regulated firms and to contribute to the securing of an appropriate degree of protection for policyholders. But importantly, the mandates for the FPC and PRA ensure that other factors such as long-term productivity and economic growth are taken into account when setting policy. The FPC must pursue its financial stability objective without causing serious harm to the wider economy in the medium or long term. In other words, the FPC must avoid the 'stability of the graveyard'. And, the FPC also has a secondary objective, subject to its pursuit of its primary objective: that of supporting the economic policy of the government. The PRA also has an important secondary objective to facilitate effective competition, and must have regard to a set of regulatory principles, including the desirability of sustainable economic growth. Furthermore, the Chancellor writes regular letters to both the FPC and the Prudential Regulation Committee, setting out the Government's economic policy and making recommendations on how they should discharge their functions. Importantly, the PRA takes into account the FPC's views on financial stability when setting microprudential policy. To give an example of how this works in practice - in 2015 the FPC set out the optimal overall level of UK capital requirements, balancing financial stability against economic growth. The PRC then took into account this judgement when setting individual bank capital requirements. And at the end of last year, the Financial Policy Committee (FPC) raised the structural level of the UK countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) rate - that is the rate it expects to set in a standard risk environment - from in the region of 1% to in the region of 2%. Then, last month, the PRA consulted on proposals to reduce variable microprudential minimum requirements (so-called variable Pillar 2A capital requirements) to take account of the additional resilience associated with higher macroprudential buffers in a standard risk environment. In addition to setting out a clear mandate in primary legislation, there are also a number of accountability mechanisms in place for Parliament to scrutinise the work of the FPC and PRA against that mandate. For example, PRA senior representatives are expected to appear before the Treasury Report is laid before Parliament. Outside the UK, the model of independent regulators with mandates making rules is common practice in most other jurisdictions. The need for operational independence is reflected in the Basel Core Principles for banking supervision. All jurisdictions represented in the Basel Committee implemented the Basel 3 reforms through regulators' rules or guidelines rather than primary legislation, with the exceptions of the EU, with its very specific supranational structure, and Switzerland, with its unique federal structure. Regulatory independence and financial stability in practice Does the evidence support the theory that an independent regulatory body with a clear mandate and strong accountability produces better outcomes? At the Bank, Fraccaroli, Sowerbutts and Whitworth (2019) have been researching whether the institutional structure for prudential regulation affects financial stability in practice. They have done this by analysing whether there is a statistically significant association between the independence of the prudential regulator and/or supervisor and financial stability outcomes. The authors have constructed for different countries and over time an index of regulatory-supervisory independence. The index combines three aspects of independence: institutional; regulatory; and budgetary. The definitions of these aspects can be found in Table 2. Independence index Aspect of independence This captures the involvement of political bodies in the appointment and dismissal of the head of the regulatory agency, as well as length of their term. The more independent are the actors in charge of the appointment and removal process, the more independent the regulatory agency will be. Moreover, the longer the head's term, the more protected the agency is from the electoral cycle. This captures whether the agency needs government approval to issue binding legislation. Higher regulatory independence allows the regulator to adapt prudential rules quickly and flexibly and to better identify with the rule-implementation and enforcement. This is based on whether needs government approval on its budget, which could affect the regulator's ability to act independently. Data on these aspects are drawn from the responses given by supervisors to a World Bank survey (Barth et al (2013)) and the statutes of the regulatory agencies and amendments to those statutes. The authors then aggregated these aspects into a single index of , covering 43 countries and the period 1999 to 2019. Chart 1 shows the average regulatory-supervisory index and the global average an index of central bank independence with respect to monetary policy. Both have increased over time, but central bank independence started growing earlier and initially as a faster pace. (a) The data on central bank independence is drawn from Bodea and Hicks (2015) and Garriga (2016). Weighted versions of the indices are used to aid comparison. The weighting is based on Cukierman et al (1992). The second step in the analysis was to examine whether there is an association between the Regulatory-Supervisory Independence index and financial stability. Defining an ex ante quantitative indicator of the success or otherwise of prudential regulation is hard, unlike with monetary policy where such measures are easier to arrive at. But fortunately, this is less of a problem for this analysis because we have ex post observations of distress in the banking system. The authors used rates of non-performing loans at banks as a measure of financial They analyse whether reforms that increased regulatory-supervisory independence were associated with subsequent a reduction in the rates of non-performing loans. Panel data regression show a negative and statistically significant association between independence-increasing reforms and rates of non-performing loans - see Table 3. Table 3: Results for regressions of non-performing loans as % of total loans on the lagged by one year This association is there even as the set of control variables in the regression is varied. The association is also persistent: the coefficient on the reforms lagged by one year is similar in magnitude and statistical significance. The association is also economically significant. A reform that increases the index in a given year is associated with a 1.3 percentage point reduction in the rate non-performing loans and a 0.97 percentage point reduction in the subsequent year, all else equal. These results are consistent with what other papers have found. Dincer and Eichengreen (2012) find that lower non-performing loans relative to GDP in countries in which the supervisor is independent of the government. Klomp and de Haan (2009) find a negative association between a measure of financial instability and the degree of central bank independence. There is also evidence that supervisors that are probably more independent of the banks they supervise tend to be more robust. For instance, Agarwal et al (2014) finds in the United States federal regulators are twice as likely to downgrade banks' supervisory ratings as state regulators. et al (2018) analyse the impact of supervisory responsibility for large banks moving from national regulators to the ECB's Single Supervisory Mechanism or SSM. They find banks for whom the SSM became their supervisor sought to manipulate their balance sheets to fall below the thresholds for being in scope of the SSM, suggesting banks anticipated that the SSM would be a tougher supervisor. The results in Table 3 mean that when countries implemented reforms that increased the independence of their prudential regulator and/or supervisor, non-performing loans as a proportion of total lending decreased. Greater regulatory independence increased financial stability. But did greater regulatory independence come at a price of less efficient banks or slower credit growth, a version of what is sometime referred to ""as the stability of the graveyard""? It seems that it did not - see Table 4. First, the authors replaced the non-performing loans with a measure of bank efficiency: the ratio between a bank's expenses and its income. The results show that the independence index does not have a statistically significant effect on bank efficiency contemporaneously or lagged by one year. Second, they used the loan growth rate as a dependent variable. The result is similar: the index does not have a statistically similar effect on loan growth. These results differ somewhat from others have found. Dincer and Eichengreen (2013) find when the supervisor is independent some measures of bank credit are lower. In contrast, Barth et al (2013b) find supervisory independence is associated with higher bank efficiency. Table 4: Results for regressions of a bank efficiency ratio or loan growth on the Regulatory- Dependent variable Bank efficiency ratio Loan growth rate Index lagged by one year In this speech, I have set out a framework for thinking about ideal post-EU institutional structure. The ideal model involves independent regulators with mandates.

6017,r201016a_BOE,united kingdom,2020-10-16,From hot air to cold hard facts: how financial markets are finally getting a grip on how to price climate risk and return,hauser,0,"I am grateful to Benjamin Bowry for his help in writing this speech, and to Andrew Bailey, Imane their comments and guidance.  and  and 2020 is not the likeliest of years for the green revolution to have started paying off in financial markets. With a global pandemic raging, and economic uncertainty at historic highs, issuers, investors and intermediaries might have been forgiven for having their minds elsewhere. But, in fact, after many years of rhetoric from market practitioners, the temperature has changed noticeably. Hot air is turning into cold hard fact: - Climate oriented equity indices have outperformed the broader market by 2-5% in 2020, as economic activity has shifted away from travel and other fossil fuel-intensive sectors, and towards - Green bonds also outperformed their conventional counterparts over that same period (Chart 2), and made up a fifth of total European investment grade issuance in September alone. And companies such as VW and Daimler secured material reductions in financing costs (or 'greeniums') when issuing their first green bonds, linked to the development of low-emission technologies; - Governments have been increasingly persuaded of the powerful direct and indirect effects of issuing their own 'sovereign green bonds' too, with a raft of countries coming to market for the first time this year: Germany's innovative dual-bond issuance was five times oversubscribed and commanded a clear greenium; and the European Commission announced that it will fund 30% of its EUR750bn 'Next Generation' budget in the same way; - More and more investment money is massing on the sidelines. Funds with above-average sustainability ratings have seen big inflows this year, and now hold $4.6 trillion in assets globally. In response, fund managers are overhauling their investment strategies to put sustainability centre stage. To take just one example, more than 500 global investors, accounting for over $47 trillion of assets, have committed to support the Climate Action 100+ initiative, aimed at ensuring the world's largest corporate greenhouse gas emitters take action on climate change. For the many organisations, including the Bank of England, that have pushed so hard for climate economics to be taken seriously, these are welcome developments, especially in the runup to next year's UN Climate Change Conference, 'COP26'. But, on a moment's reflection, the fact that this is happening now is less surprising. Covid-19 reminds us all that we cannot ignore the daunting forces of the natural world. And it is accelerating economic trends that had previously been slow to reveal themselves. Those trends bring many challenges - but they also bring opportunity, amongst them the chance to advance the pace of climate transition.  and growing investor demand. And third, asset allocation strategies allowing those investors to construct portfolios aligned with, and facilitating, the transition to a carbon neutral economy. For much of the past decade, those three building blocks have been slow to develop, or vulnerable to charges of 'greenwashing' (projects, vehicles or investment strategies that are 'green' in name only). I want first to review why that historical performance has been so sluggish, before turning to look at how things are changing, and fast, under the influences of shifting public policy and consumer behaviour, and the physical realities of a changing planet. I will focus mainly on developments in private financial markets, but will also touch on some of the ways that we in the UK public sector can contribute, as market participants in our own right. Why markets have struggled to price climate risk: externalities, horizons and opacity Given the sheer scale of the climate challenge, it is at first glance surprising that financial markets have struggled to reflect it in asset pricing. The reasons for that failure are threefold. First, it is in the nature of climate change that many of the costs of failing to address it, and the opportunities for positive change, fall to society as a whole, rather than specific individuals or companies. The freedom to emit unlimited amounts of carbon is one example. Markets are notoriously poor at pricing such 'externalities'. Not all climate risks are externalities, of course. Investor activism can bring consequences to bear on firms viewed to be responsible for climate harm. And climate-related natural disasters - already three times more frequent than 40 years ago - fall on real individuals and real companies. Financial markets and institutions can help provide insurance against those risks, but great care is needed to ensure such cover is provided appropriately: too little, and households, companies and lenders will go under-covered; too much, and insurers may be unable to follow through on their commitments. But the most important force for internalising these externalities will be public policy - on climate regulation, carbon pricing and taxing, and legal liability. Such policy 'privatises' the social cost on specific companies and sectors of the economy, and creates powerful opportunities for those first to innovate climate-positive technologies. I will not have more to say on the priorities for future policy in this area today, but it is safe to say that these steps will only intensify as governments follow through on the sort of mid-century net-zero commitments legislated in law by the UK last year, and recently by China. The second factor impeding financial market pricing of climate risk has been the long horizon over which that risk has historically been thought likely to crystallise. Financial markets do not have a great track record pricing such longer-term phenomena, particularly when their scale and incidence is also uncertain - a failing  and that Mark Carney has called the 'tragedy of the horizon'. But here, too, things are changing. Climate risk doesn't seem so hypothetical or far off to those gazing at red skies over San Francisco, fleeing their burning homes in the Australian outback, baling out flooded villages in the UK, or contemplating big writedowns in the value of their businesses (as the boards of Ford, VW, BP and Shell, to name but a few, have done). Here, a combination of consumer action, government policy, and financial market pricing are bringing the future into the present. The final issue is the most prosaic, but perhaps also the most important from a financial markets perspective - and that is the historic absence of robust measurement. Measurement of how much pollution specific companies, their supply chains and consumer markets, produce. And measurement of the extent, and efficacy, of remedial action. While financial performance and risk is measured, and audited, to the nth degree, climate risk has historically been a void. What isn't measured can't be priced, traded or risk managed. This is perhaps where change has been most profound, as I will discuss shortly. The consequences of the historic failure of financial markets to price climate risk have been two fold. Much of the focus has been on the under-pricing of downside risk - to polluters, or polluted - and the potential for a 'climate Minsky moment': a sudden sharp downwards adjustment when that risk crystallises. But opportunities to improve climate outcomes have been under-priced too: making it harder to get the finance needed to drive positive change. Both sides of this equation need to change - and they are. The building blocks of change In what follows I want to cover those three key building blocks for an effective capital markets infrastructure that I mentioned at the start: climate disclosure ; climate-linked capital instruments ; and climate-focused asset allocation strategies . But before doing so I will note an irony - which is that the very need to have climate-specific tools reveals the immaturity of financial markets' relationship with climate risk. In a world where climate risks were fully internalised, measured, priced and traded, there would be little need for dedicated climate financial infrastructure: climate risk would be factored into each and every risk and reward decision. Green bonds would just be bonds. And 'impact investors' could focus their efforts on other challenges, as market pricing would align the private and societal costs associated with greenhouse gas emissions. That 'integrated approach' is a worthy goal: the Holy Grail of market maturity. But we are some way from that today. The field of climate disclosure is as good an example of that gap as any. No-one needs to convince public companies of the merits of regular disclosure of their financial risks and returns: their economic health depends on it; and, just in case that's not enough, it's compulsory.  and The incentives to disclose climate risks and returns may seem somewhat less hard-edged. Much of the early discourse on disclosure has certainly been aimed at encouraging firms to adopt such disclosures voluntarily. But that is changing rapidly. Companies at the sharp end have increasingly strong business incentives to disclose, some of which I've tried to summarise in Table 1. Robust climate metrics not only help with managing your own investment programme, they also signal clearly to your retail and business customers, and your employees, that you 'get it' and have coherent plans to address the risks over time. Doing so buys customer commitment and brand image, and helps your supply chain; failing to do so risks customer boycotts, lost contracts and poor investment planning. Something similar is afoot in capital markets too. Disclosing your plans can improve your credit rating, broaden your investor base, reduce your cost of finance, and economise on the fixed costs of meeting increasingly vocal investor requests for information. A recent large-scale study of some 6,000 corporate disclosures found that firms that published data on their Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance received cheaper debt funding, with environmental disclosures having the largest effect. increasingly that message is getting across: three-quarters of UK board members believe structured disclosure along the lines of that recommended by the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) will increase brand value, nearly half expect improved alignment with shareholder priorities, and a third already see tangible financial benefits. Table 1: Potential economic benefits of disclosing climate metrics (and costs of not) Potential issuer benefits from disclosing Potential issuer costs from not disclosing terms and asset valuations Credit rating Improved rating Worse rating Lower uncertainty risk premium Higher asset valuations Lower asset valuations Size of investor base Access to more investors Shrinking investor base Financing rate Cheaper finance More expensive finance as raters/investors apply a risk premium Fixed cost of investor engagement Lower cost of engaging with investors Confusion drives increasing costs of investor engagement  and management Management of own risks Improved understanding and ability to manage risks Weaker awareness internally and externally Retail consumer expectations / demand Improved brand image and hence demand / revenues Customer boycotts harm firms' positions in contested markets Supply chain expectations / demand Awarded more contracts from firms seeking lower Cut out of contracts from firms seeking lower 'Scope 3' scores Human resources Attracting, motivating, and retaining staff Challenges in hiring and retaining key staff compliance Clean regulatory record Fines and infractions That's all very well for firms with a good story to tell - but doesn't it still pay laggards to stay silent? Increasingly not. Where firms fail to provide their own authoritative disclosures, customers, investors and rating agencies will attempt to construct their own. And that's not good for your financial health: because disagreement between different measures of a firm's climate performance, whether driven by poor data or otherwise, increases equity risk premia, and hence the cost of raising investment finance. It increases the overhead from dealing with investor queries or resolutions on ESG issues, which have risen this year despite And it will leave you scrambling when disclosure becomes mandatory. The FCA is already consulting on proposals that firms listed in the UK will be expected to make a TCFD disclosure. And the EU Taxonomy Regulation will make green revenue and expenditure disclosures obligatory for those falling within its jurisdiction. Setting out pathways to mandatory TCFD disclosures should be a priority for public authorities; in the UK this is being explored by the Government-led taskforce on climate disclosure. If that gives the case for disclosure in principle, what makes a good disclosure from the perspective of effective capital markets functioning? According to the TCFD, disclosures should be: consistent (complete, and comparable across time and issuers); 'decision useful' (relevant to investment decisions, specific, reliable, verifiable); and forward looking (showing not just where you have been, but where you are going, and how).  and Consistency - the first of those criteria - has been a challenge. The TCFD is widely recognised as the right overarching framework: nearly half of large companies globally were already disclosing TCFD-aligned metrics at the time of the last comprehensive survey in 2019 (Chart 3), and support for the TCFD had grown to over 1,440 organisations by September this year, with a market capitalisation of over $12.6 trillion. But at the next level of detail - the standards giving specific guidance on what should be disclosed and how - there under these approaches are being packaged by third-party providers into a daunting variety of summary statistics, the correlation between which can be low or zero, even when they purport to measure identical Such diversity can be helpful in driving innovation. But fragmentation of standards is no basis for a viable global capital market for climate risk. In recognition of that fact, the 'group of five' framework producers, the 'big four' accounting firms have all recently announced initiatives to deliver a single harmonised set of metrics that could be commonly adopted and reported alongside other core financial information. These are positive developments - but given the importance of consistent climate disclosures, further definitive convergence is needed, and soon.  and The second TCFD criterion is that good metrics should be 'decision useful'. From a business management perspective, this point is obvious: to be useful in shaping strategy, a metric has to be something with a direct influence on investment decisions. And from a financial markets perspective, it has to be relevant to understanding risk and return. A lack of meaningful, consistent metrics makes it hard, or impossible, for investors to construct viable portfolios by comparing climate performance across firms. And that, in turn, dampens the incentive of those firms to improve and disclose their climate performance in the first place.  and metrics would not only underperform an alternative strategy that takes account of forward looking information, it would also risk failing to fund the very investments needed to tackle climate change. The biggest rewards will fall to those who are first to spot a heavy polluting company on its way to becoming credibly green. Forward looking disclosures can take many forms. At the highest level, they may set out issuers' climate targets, and their chosen strategies for meeting them. They may give specific descriptions of investment projects. Or they may involve model-based projections of future performance. We at the Bank of England showed one such measure, of 'portfolio warming potential', when we published the first full disclosure of the climate risks on our own balance sheet earlier this year. The measure, based on the provider's emissions projections for each issuer with corporate bonds held in the Bank's Asset Purchase Facility (APF), suggested that if those projections were representative of the emissions performance of corporates globally, the world So far, so dramatic. But similar measures based on alternative forecast assumptions for the same portfolio suggested a much wider range of possible outcomes, from <1.75 to 4 degrees: a huge variation given the consequences of missing a 2 degree warming target (Chart 6). The problem stems in part from different assumptions about how the world will evolve and how different industries will need to react. For a given temperature goal, investors need to know how much carbon can be emitted, over what timeframe, and by whom, in order to assess where companies sit relative to their required trajectory. Detailed and standardised reference scenarios are needed for this kind of assessment, such as those being developed by the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial system.  and The direct benefits to government finances are similar to those in the corporate sector, and include the ability to lock in commitments to undertake climate-improving investment, while reducing issuance costs and reaching a larger, more diverse investor base. But there are also potential indirect benefits for their national economies: establishing a 'green risk free curve' for private issuers to use as a benchmark for green pricing; setting conventions for issuance, including definitions of acceptably green projects or climate goals; providing assets for hedging and collateralising borrowing; and encouraging the development of climate finance expertise in the local financial services community, driving wider product innovation. The issuance of corporate green bonds in the Netherlands, for example, picked up materially after the Dutch government Building block 3: asset allocation strategies However rapid the progress in climate-related disclosures and financing vehicles on the issuer side of the equation, it has been totally eclipsed by the explosion in interest on the investor side. Gripped by an increasing awareness of the scale of the climate challenge, and the impact of past and expected future policy change, investors are demanding, ever more loudly, that those in charge of their savings demonstrate that they can measure, and direct, their investments in ways that are sensitive to the climate impact of those flows. Asset managers have launched an ever-increasing range of 'climate aware' funds in recent years (Chart 14), and invested heavily in internal expertise, building systems, and hiring in specialists (or buying their firms outright). The consequent shift in assets under management towards funds with higher sustainability ratings, and away from those with lower ratings, is striking (Chart 15). But amidst all this frenzied activity, the most pressing question is how to put all of this money to work in a productive way that appropriately reflects climate factors, but also continues to deliver the desired risk and return profile for investors.  and Chart 17 shows a range of such strategies. The simplest approach is a 'screen', in which the asset manager constructs a portfolio by including, or excluding, certain companies or sectors. Such approaches are currently popular because they can be directly linked to investors' wishes (eg 'no fossil fuel producers'), and require little in the way of sophisticated climate metrics. But they cannot provide much of the solution to a credible path to a carbon neutral economy. While individual investors may be able to divest, the financial  and 'Unconstrained' investment - the final category in the chart - is a catch-all for the wide variety of active management strategies that investors can employ, either across an entire portfolio, or as an overlay. Such strategies may for example be driven by top-down or bottom-up research, or by quantitative statistical analysis of correlations between environmental factors and risk-adjusted returns. While such approaches have at least the potential to deliver stronger performance, by substituting judgment or modelling for current data gaps, they are clearly more costly to undertake and harder for end-investors to monitor. This analysis draws out an interesting interaction between the quality of climate disclosures, the structure of the asset management industry and the scope for rapid growth in the role of capital markets in climate investment. Poor disclosures force investors either to form crude portfolios - which cannot send particular finely graduated price signals - or to seek active management - which, being costly, is not available to all. Neither is ideal. It is only when disclosures have reached true maturity that the full panoply of modern asset allocation techniques can be brought to bear. That underscores just how vital it is to make progress on disclosures. There are as yet few comprehensive studies of the relative performance of current strategies. Indeed, there is a genuine question about how such performance should be measured, given that one motivation for investing in climate-based funds is the desire to generate a measurable beneficial environmental impact alongside a financial return - so-called 'impact investing'. There has been a long and lively debate about whether achieving this requires a willingness to sacrifice financial gain. Some funds explicitly recognise this possibility in their construction, for example granting explicit concessionary rates to climate-positive projects. But others dispute the existence of such a tradeoff, noting the range of non-financial tools such as investor engagement that can act as ways to achieve impact. What is certainly true, as I've argued throughout this speech, is that such tradeoffs should not exist when the costs of emissions have been effectively internalised, and capital market structures have fully matured. That must be our ultimate goal. The choice of potential investment strategies is a live issue for the Bank of England too, as a market participant in our own right. Most of our asset holdings consist of UK government securities. But 2% of the Bank's Asset Purchase Facility consists of sterling corporate bonds, acquired as part of the MPC's quantitative easing programme. As we stated in our TCFD disclosure, the framework for the MPC's asset purchases is determined by the Committee's remit given to it by the Chancellor. But, subject to the Government indicating a willingness to update this remit, we will over the coming year be considering how to incorporate climate factors into decisions on the mix of financial assets, whilst still achieving our policy aims. We will have much to learn from the range of approaches already adopted in the private sector. So where does this all leave us? One thing is clear: there is a lot to be positive about - capital markets are innovating, and rapidly, in response to the very real rise in demand from clients, businesses, investors and public authorities to take  and climate risk and return seriously. And that innovation is beginning to drive some hard-edged price discrimination based on climate risks. In short, the hot air is cooling. But some big challenges remain: - disclosures , to reach the goal of securing a fully consistent, decision useful and forward looking set of metrics requires standard setters to agree on a single framework; for it to be made mandatory; and for corporates to measure, model and disclose; - instruments , we need to see a further scaling up in the range and depth of tools providing credible incentives for green investment and more effective transparency for investors on performance against climate goals. That will drive broader-based price discrimination between climate-positive and climate-negative assets, which in turn will provide powerful incentives for further adjustment; and - asset allocation strategies , we need to coalesce more around terminology and approaches, providing a clear and credible choice for clients and investors, on that journey towards full integration. And we need more research on what works and what doesn't! Many of the actions here are for the financial markets themselves to resolve - and rightly so, because we want the power of markets working to deliver climate change. But there are important priorities for the public authorities too: to ensure externalities are properly internalised, so markets can do their job; to help co-ordinate and set market-wide standards, and where necessary to make them obligatory; and to use our strength and influence as market participants in our own right to drive change, where doing so is consistent with our mandates. We at the Bank of England are doing all those things. As I noted at the start, the irony is that true success will come when we don't even talk about climate risk and return any more as a special category, but simply factor it into our every decision as part of an integrated whole. If the momentum we are currently seeing in capital markets continues, that end-goal maybe closer than we think.

6245,r990216a_FOMC,united states,1999-02-16,The interaction of education and economic change,greenspan,1,"The interaction of education and economic change When Neil Rudenstine first invited me to join you today, he suggested that it might be valuable to discuss the roots of the changes that our economy has been experiencing in recent years. As leaders in higher education, you have all been dealing with the practical effects of these shifts. But, in more theoretical terms, what do these historic changes teach us about the way we learn and innovate? What is their impact on the workforce and on your graduates? How has technology transformed our ability to understand the natural and social world? Our faculty for rational thought has carried the human race one arduous step at a time into a deeper understanding of how the world works. Decade by decade, scholars have recorded their insights, building knowledge from one generation to the next. We have learned to use that knowledge to alter our physical environment for the betterment of mankind. That process has become increasingly conceptual in nature and ever less reliant on physical materials. Indeed, the endeavor to economize on physical resources has led to widespread downsizing of the elements of the nation's output. We have dramatically reduced the size of our radios, for example, by substituting transistors for vacuum tubes. Thin fiber-optic cable has replaced huge tonnages of copper wire. New architectural, engineering, and materials technologies have enabled the construction of buildings enclosing the same space, but with far less physical material than was required, say, 50 or 100 years ago. Most recently, mobile phones have been markedly downsized as they have been improved. Over the last century, for example, the rate of increase of the gross domestic product in the United States, adjusted for price change--our measure of gains in the real value of output--has averaged around three percent per year. Only a small fraction of that represents growth in the tonnage of physical materials--oil, coal, ores, wood, raw chemicals, for example. The remainder represents new insights into how to rearrange those physical materials to better serve human needs. This process has enabled valued goods to be transported more easily and to be produced with ever fewer workers, allowing the more efficient division of labor to propel overall output and standards of living progressively higher. The share of the nation's output that is conceptual appears to have accelerated following World War II with the insights that led to the development of the transistor and microprocessor. They have spawned remarkable alterations in how we, and other developed societies, live. Computers, telecommunications, and satellite technologies have enabled data and ideas, the ever more important elements of output, to be speedily transferred geographically to where they can be put to best use. Thus, these advanced means of communication have added much the same type of value that the railroads added in transporting the more physical goods of an earlier century. Here in the United States, we have developed an exceptionally sophisticated stock of capital assets--plant and equipment--fostered most recently by what has to be the most conceptual and impalpable of all new major products--software. The breakthroughs in information technology have facilitated an elevated rate of ""creative destruction,"" as noted Harvard economist Joseph Schumpeter put it earlier this century. Our capital stock is undergoing an increasing pace of renewal through investment of cash flow from older-technology capital facilities into new, more efficient vintages. Some Silicon Valley firms claim that they completely reconstitute themselves every year or two. This renewal process is driven by an increasing ability to more finely calibrate the value preferences of consumers. In turn, those preferences are converted, through market transactions, into prices of products and assets. They, in turn, signal entrepreneurs which capital facilities to build to meet those shifting consumer needs. But as human intelligence appears without limit to engage our physical environment, human psychology remains, in some more primordial sense, invariant to time. The rapidity of change in our capital assets, the infrastructure with which all workers must interface day-by-day, has clearly raised the level of anxiety and insecurity in the workforce. As recently as 1981, in the depths of a recession, International Survey Research found twelve percent of workers fearful of losing their jobs. In today's tightest labor market in two generations, the same organization has recently found thirty-seven percent concerned about job loss. The fear of job obsolescence when confronted with a rapidly changing work environment is arguably one reason for a massive increase in the demand for educational services--the rise in on-the-job training, the proliferation of community colleges enhancing work skills, so-called corporate universities that combine jobs-oriented curricula with some broader excursions into the liberal arts, and, of course, the traditional university curricula. The heyday when a high school or college education would serve a graduate for a lifetime is gone. Today's recipients of diplomas expect to have many jobs and to use a wide range of skills over their working lives. Their parents and grandparents looked to a more stable future--even if in reality it often turned out otherwise. However one views the uncertainty that so many in our workforce are experiencing in their endeavor to advance, an economist can scarcely fail to notice a marketplace working efficiently to guide our educational system, defined in its widest sense, toward the broader needs of our economy. But this is not new. The history of education in the United States traces a path heavily influenced by the need for a workforce with the skills required to interact productively with the evolving economic infrastructure. Historically, technological advance has brought with it improvements not only in the capital inputs used in production, but also new demands on workers who must interact with that increasingly more complex stock of capital. Early this century, these advances required workers with a higher level of cognitive skills, for instance the ability to read manuals, to interpret blueprints, or to understand formulae. Our educational system responded: In the 1920s and 1930s, high school enrollment in this country expanded rapidly, pulling youth from rural areas, where opportunities were limited, into more productive occupations in business and broadening the skills of students to meet the needs of an advancing manufacturing sector. It became the job of these institutions to prepare students for work life, not just for a transition to college. In the context of the demands of the economy at that time, a high school diploma represented the training needed to be successful in most aspects of American enterprise. The economic returns for having a high school diploma rose and, as a result, high school enrollment rates climbed. At the same time, our system of higher education was also responding to the advances in economic processes. Although many states had established land grant schools earlier, their support accelerated in the late nineteenth century as those whose economies specialized in agriculture and mining sought to take advantage of new scientific methods of production. Early in the twentieth century, the content of education at an American college--as you all are aware--had evolved from a classically based curriculum to one combining the sciences, empirical studies, and modern liberal arts. Universities responded to the need for the application of science--particularly chemistry and physics--to the manufacture of steel, rubber, chemicals, petroleum, and other goods requiring the newer production technologies. Communities looked to their institutions of higher learning for leadership in scientific knowledge and for training of professionals such as teachers and engineers. The scale and scope of higher education in America was being shaped by the recognition that research--the creation of knowledge--complemented teaching and training--the diffusion of knowledge. In broad terms, the basic structure of higher education remains much the same today. That structure has proven sufficiently flexible to respond to the needs of a changing economy. Market economies have succeeded over the centuries by granting rewards to those who could anticipate changes in the value preferences of society. America's system of higher education has evolved into a highly diverse and complex range of institutions--large research universities that combine undergraduate and graduate offerings, small liberal arts colleges, and vocation-oriented community colleges--all seeking their competitive advantage. What makes that system work effectively is that it has been influenced importantly by the values of a strong market economy--competition, risk-taking, and innovation. America's reputation as the world's leader in higher education is grounded in the ability of these versatile institutions, taken together, to serve the practical needs of the economy and, more significantly, to unleash the creative thinking that moves our society forward. In a global environment in which prospects for economic growth now depend importantly on a country's capacity to develop and apply new technologies, the research facilities of our universities are envied throughout the world. The payoffs--in terms of the flow of expertise, new products, and startup companies, for example--have been impressive. Here, perhaps the most frequently cited measures of our success have been the emergence of significant centers of commercial innovation and entrepreneurship--Silicon Valley, the Research Triangle, and the clustering of biotech enterprises in the Northeast corridor--where creative ideas flow freely between local academic scholars and those in industry. Beyond these highly visible achievements, what has made our research universities so extraordinarily productive is their promotion of peer-reviewed scholarship and the value they place on creativity and risk-taking. Although some innovations move quickly from the development stage to applications, more often, we cannot accurately predict which particular scientific advance, or synergy of advances, will ultimately prove valuable. One has only to recall our experience with the laser, which had to wait for improvements in fiber optics to yield important applications. Indeed, according to Nobel Laureate Charles Townes, in the late 1960s the attorneys for Bell Labs initially refused to patent the laser because they believed it had no applications in the field of telecommunications. Our universities have shown the patience and the flexibility to accept that uncertainty, confident that the rigorous effort to explore ideas would eventually lead to discovery. If we are to remain preeminent in transforming knowledge into economic value, America's system of higher education must remain the world's leader in generating scientific and technological breakthroughs and in meeting the challenge to educate workers. With two-thirds of our high school graduates now enrolling in college and a growing proportion of adult workers seeking opportunities for retooling, our institutions of higher learning now bear the overwhelming responsibility for ensuring that our society is prepared for the demands of rapid economic change. What our colleges and universities produce is highly valued in today's economy. The rise in that value over the past several decades has been reflected in a widening spread between compensation paid to college-educated workers relative to those with less schooling. Accordingly, college enrollment rates among new U.S. high school graduates have been rising. And despite competitive pressures to improve university education abroad, almost one-third of all students who leave their home countries to study elsewhere choose to study in the United States. In recent years, the most popular fields of study for both groups have been business and management, but, as you are all aware, interest in life sciences, math, and computer sciences has been growing rapidly. Another measure of the value placed on university education is the rising propensity of older workers to return to school. Today, more than one-fourth of all undergraduates are over thirty years old; one-fifth of these older students are enrolled in full-time programs. These individuals are already responding to the need to seek retooling during their careers. As a result, education is increasingly becoming a lifelong activity. Businesses are now looking for employees who are prepared to continue learning and who recognize that maintaining their human capital will require persistent hard work and flexibility. The press for lifelong learning and the availability of technology have spawned a variety of education initiatives outside the traditional classroom. Courses now can be taken ""at a distance"" over the Internet. These are just the newest in a series of attempts to move learning closer to workers on the job and to make it more relevant to changing business needs. Although many of these new programs focus on specific, applied skill training, some degree-granting programs already exist, and companies that have successfully developed interactive educational software for the classroom are looking to move it online. Competition is the necessary driving force toward delivering a superior product or service. We should not shy away from it. Colleges and universities are being challenged to evaluate how new information technologies can best be employed in their curricula and their delivery systems. Beyond these more practical issues, the most significant challenge facing our universities is to ensure that teaching and research continue to unleash the creative intellectual energy that drives our system forward. As the conceptual share of the value added in our economic processes continues to grow, the ability to think abstractly will be increasingly important across a broad range of professions. Critical awareness and the abilities to hypothesize, to interpret, and to communicate are essential elements of successful innovation in a conceptual-based economy. The roots and nature of how the human mind innovates have always been subject to controversy. Yet, even without hard indisputable evidence, there is a remarkable and broad presumption that the ability to think abstractly is fostered through exposure to philosophy, literature, music, art, and languages. Liberal education is presumed to spawn a greater understanding of all aspects of living--an essential ingredient to broaden one's world view by ""vaulting over disciplinary walls,"" as my good friend Judith Rodin put it, and exploring other fields of study. Most great conceptual advances are interdisciplinary and involve synergies of different specialities. Yet there is more to the liberal arts than increasing technical intellectual efficiency. They encourage the appreciation of life experiences that reach beyond material well-being and, indeed, are comparable and mutually reinforcing. The intense pleasure many experience from listening to Mozart's great D Minor Piano Concerto has much in common with the deep satisfaction of solving a complex mathematical problem. The challenge for our institutions of higher education is to successfully blend the exposure to all aspects of human intellectual activity, especially our artistic propensities and our technical skills. What makes the challenge particularly daunting is that scientific knowledge expands and broadens the measurable rewards of its curriculum at a pace that liberal arts, by their nature, arguably have difficulty matching. The depth of knowledge in nuclear physics is today far greater than it was a century ago, creating an enormous expansion in economically useful teaching hours. But do the same economic opportunities exist for courses in English literature? A related difference between science and the arts arises in the non-academic world: Engineering and metallurgical advances have reduced the number of hours required to produce a ton of steel, but the same number of musicians will be needed to perform a Beethoven quartet this evening as were needed a century ago. Many of you will recognize this application of Baumol's Law. To make the point even more graphically, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan has noted that the Minute Waltz could be played in 50 seconds, but he wondered if it would sound as good. Overwhelmed with the increasing scientific knowledge base, our universities are going to have to struggle to prevent the liberal arts curricula from being swamped by technology and science. It is crucial that that not happen. The advent of the twenty-first century will certainly bring new challenges for our society and for our education system. We cannot know the precise directions in which advances in technology and the transmission of knowledge will take us. However, we can be certain that our institutions of higher education will remain at the center of the endeavor to comprehend those profound changes and to seize the opportunities to direct them toward ever-rising standards of living and quality of life.

6247,r990225a_FOMC,united states,1999-02-25,Private Market Discipline Is the First Line of Defense,ferguson,0,"This evening I would like to spend a few minutes discussing some of the implications of the rapid and ongoing evolution of our financial institutions and markets. New financial instruments, innovations in portfolio management, and the technological capability of implementing new risk management strategies offer opportunities to reduce risk and to improve efficiency by allocating risk to those most willing to accept it. Reductions of trade barriers and the freer flow of financial capital around the world mean better resource allocation, improved productivity, and higher standards of living for citizens of the United States and many other nations. While the current and potential benefits of financial and technological change are real and substantial, they do not come without some costs. For example, the rapid pace of technological change and the wide array of innovative financing techniques have in some ways made it more difficult for outside investors and policymakers to evaluate the risks borne by individual institutions and the broader markets. And, nearly instantaneous communications and heightened interdependencies among nations speed the effects of poor investment and policy decisions around the globe. Recent experiences in Asia, Russia, Latin America, and at home have taught us a lot about the risks of an increasingly interdependent world linked by complex financial relationships. In this rapidly evolving world of inevitable benefits and costs, the key question for both financial policymakers and market participants is: How can we retain the benefits of rapid technological and financial innovation and of freer movements of goods and financial capital across national borders, while simultaneously protecting our financial institutions and markets from the risks that these changes might bring? This is not a new question, and I am sure that most of this audience is well aware that many efforts are underway in both the public and private sectors to address the variety of issues that this question evokes. As always, there are no simple answers. But I believe that a number of fundamental principles have emerged that should be used to help shape both public and private policies and practices. Perhaps the most fundamental principle that must guide us is that private market participants are the first line of defense against excessive private and public risk in the financial system. Private borrowers, lenders, investors, institutions, traders, brokers, exchanges, and clearing systems all have huge stakes in containing their risks as individual agents and risks to the system as a whole. Private market participants can discourage excessive risk taking by choosing to do business with those firms that demonstrate sound risk management systems and portfolios that balance appropriately risk and expected return. If private markets are going to perform their risk control functions, then market prices must send the right signals to all participants about the risks and rewards of a particular transaction or at a given firm. In order to improve the ability of market prices to accurately reflect risks and returns, I believe that we should take action ourselves and encourage action by others in at least three areas. First, we should seek ways of improving the transparency of financial institutions and markets. As we all know, full information is a fundamental requirement of free and competitive markets. More particularly, financial institutions and individual investors must be well informed about their own and their counterparties' exposures, the nature of new financial instruments, and the extent of overall market liquidity. I believe that banks and other financial institutions could significantly improve their disclosures by providing more information to the market about their risk management policies and practices and about the values of internal risk measures. At present, the market seems to grant great weight to bank regulatory capital ratios that are only crude indicators of an institution's risk profile. That attention is driven in large part by the fact that these regulatory measures provide a consistent basis for comparison. The regulatory and financial communities should work together to identify more meaningful statistics to meet the market's needs. At the international level much work is being done, and much remains. One of the key lessons of our most recent financial crises is that international accounting and public disclosure standards are often inadequate. An important step forward was the publication last November by the international Basle Committee on Banking Supervision of guidelines for enhancing bank transparency. That report provides guidance to banks and banking supervisors around the world on the nature of core disclosures that should be provided to the public. Much more, however, should be done to provide the public and supervisors with the information they need to exert effective market discipline. A second area where we could improve market discipline is in affecting how market participants view what has come to be known as the too-big-to-fail problem. In this regard, I would emphasize that the FDIC Improvement Act of 1991, or FDICIA, contains rather tough language about too-big-to-fail--language that I assure you the Board takes very seriously. Perhaps it would be useful to review briefly what the law says. FDICIA requires that, regardless of the size of a bank, the bank resolution method chosen by the FDIC be the least costly of all possible methods for meeting the FDIC's obligation to protect insured deposits. In addition, FDICIA prohibits the FDIC from assisting uninsured depositors and creditors, or shareholders of an insured depository institution. Add to these FDICIA provisions the depositor preference provisions in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, and you have some rather potent reasons for the market to be disciplined in its dealings with insured depositories. The only exception to these obligations is the so-called ""systemic risk exception."" But the systemic risk exception is quite tough and explicit. It requires concurrence by two-thirds of the Federal Reserve Board, two-thirds of the FDIC Board, and the Secretary of Treasury in consultation with the President that conformance with least-cost resolution would ""have serious adverse effects on economic conditions or financial activity"" before the FDIC is allowed to ""take other action or provide assistance as necessary to avoid or mitigate such effects."" In addition, if the systemic risk exception is used, any insurance fund losses arising from such exceptional actions must be recovered through special assessments on all depository institutions that are members of the relevant federal deposit insurance fund. Lastly, the Comptroller General must subsequently review the agencies' actions and report its findings to Congress. The sum total of these conditions establishes, in my view, a rather high hurdle that must be cleared before the systemic risk exception can be used. The FDICIA and other reforms have, I believe, altered market perceptions of too-big-to-fail. Nonetheless, the obvious need for the central bank and other government agencies to prevent a systemic collapse of the banking and financial system, the creation of seemingly ever-larger financial organizations, and the inherent uncertainties involved in the management of any crisis leave room for doubt in some observers' minds. Perhaps by its very nature this is an issue that can never be fully resolved. But it seems clear to me that any institution, regardless of size, can fail in the sense that existing stockholders can lose their total investment, existing management can be replaced, and uninsured creditors can suffer losses. In some cases it may be necessary for an institution to stay in operation and be wound down in an orderly way over a transition period. Ultimately, the institution could be sold in whole or in part. But even in such cases the expectation of owners, managers, and uninsured creditors should be that real and significant losses will be incurred. In my judgment, if policies consistent with these principles are followed, then we will have eliminated much of the moral hazard associated with the federal safety net for depository institutions while simultaneously being able to achieve our goal of preserving financial stability. One way to enhance the ability of market participants to limit risk taking by banks might be to require at least the largest and most complex banks to issue a minimum amount of subordinated debt. Many such proposals have surfaced over the last decade, including some from within the Federal Reserve System. And while I think that it is premature to endorse any one proposal, indeed there are a number of thorny details that would need to be worked out, I am strongly attracted to the basic concept advanced by proponents of subordinated debt. The fundamental notion behind requiring at least some banks to issue traded subordinated debt is to create a set of uninsured bank creditors whose risk preferences are similar to those of bank supervisors. Because subordinated debt holders have downside risk, but virtually no upside potential, subordinated debt holders tend to be risk averse in much the same way as is the FDIC. Thus, when a bank sought to issue subordinated debt the price that investors were willing to pay would bring direct market discipline aimed at controlling excessive risk taking by the bank. A second key objective is to create a set of market instruments that would provide clear, and frequent, signals of the market's evaluation of a bank's financial condition. Such signals could act as a deterrent to a bank's tendency to take excessive risk, and could perhaps alert bank supervisors to examine, or otherwise intervene in, a bank more quickly than they otherwise would. Changes in the market prices of traded bank subordinated debt, and perhaps other actions by the owners of this debt, have the potential to provide such signals. In this way subordinated debt could be used to bring indirect market discipline on a bank. While market discipline must be our first line of defense for ensuring financial stability, bank supervision also has an important role to play. The very nature of a systemic disruption, which imposes costs on not only the perpetrators, but also on many and diverse economic agents far removed from the immediate event, means that market participants find it impossible to fully incorporate systemic risks into market prices. Indeed, it is this very aspect of systemic risk that justifies the existence of a government safety net for depository institutions. The inevitable moral hazard of the safety net requires that bank supervisors have the ability to exert supervisory discipline on the riskiness of banks. I would like to comment tonight on what I consider two of the most pressing needs in the bank supervisory area: the need to make capital standards more risk sensitive, and the need to focus supervisory practice more on risk measurement and management. I need not explain to this audience why the maintenance of strong capital positions is critical to the preservation of a safe and sound banking system. Indeed, ensuring strong capital has been a cornerstone of bank supervision for decades. However, the development by some of our largest and most complex banks of increasingly sophisticated models for measuring, managing, and pricing risk has called into question the continuing usefulness of the current capital standards--the so-called risk-based capital standards--that are part of the Basle Accord. The Basle Accord capital standards were adopted in 1988 by most of the world's industrialized nations in an effort to encourage stronger capital at riskier banks, to include off-balance sheet exposures in the assessment of capital adequacy, and to establish more consistent capital standards across nations. The Accord was a major advance in 1988, and initially proved to be very useful in promoting safety and soundness goals. But in recent years calls for reform have begun to grow. I will outline briefly one of the key problems we are currently facing with the Basle Accord. The Basle Accord divides on- and off-balance sheet assets of banks into four risk buckets, and then applies a different capital weight to each bucket. The basic idea is that more capital should be required to be held against riskier assets. However, the relationship is rough. Perhaps most troublesome, the same risk weight is applied to all loans. Thus, for example, a loan to a very risky ""junk bond"" company gets the same weight as a loan to a ""triple A"" rated firm. While the Accord has the virtue of being relatively easy to administer, it also clearly gives banks an incentive to sell or not to originate loans that their internal models say need less capital than is required by the Basle Accord. Conversely, banks are encouraged to book loans that their models say require more capital than does the Basle standard. Not surprisingly, some banks have devoted substantial resources to attempting to achieve both adjustments to their portfolios. The resulting ""regulatory arbitrage"" surely causes some serious problems. For one thing, it makes reported capital ratios -- a key measure of bank soundness used by supervisors and investors -- less meaningful for government supervisors and private analysts. Efforts are currently underway to redress many of the deficiencies in the current Basle Accord. But many of the issues are complex, and the optimal changes are still unclear. A consensus does seem to have developed that the Accord must be more risk sensitive. But how risk sensitive, and how should that risk sensitivity best be implemented? I foresee a multi-staged process with perhaps some modest and relatively noncontroversial ""fixes"" being proposed, possibly in the very near future, and more fundamental reforms being developed and implemented over a period of several years. Given the dynamic nature of change in the financial sector, such a phased, or evolutionary, approach to revising the Accord is probably not just the only practical strategy, but also the most prudent as well. The need for an evolutionary approach can be made with perhaps even more force to other supervisory policies and procedures. For example, the increasing use and sophistication of credit risk models at the largest and most complex domestic and foreign banks has profound implications for supervisory activities as well as capital regulation. Understanding and evaluating credit risk models and related risk measurement techniques are quickly becoming required skills of bank supervisors. This need is fueled by the ever-growing array of securitizations, credit derivatives, remote originations, financial guarantees, and a seemingly endless stream of other financial innovations. Add to this the fantastic speed with which financial transactions can now be conducted, and one begins to get a feel for the many challenges facing bank supervisors. With these realities in mind, supervisory practices at all of the banking agencies are changing. Oversight of banks has become much more continuous and risk-focused than even a few years ago, especially at the largest and most complex organizations. It is recognized that we can no longer rely on periodic on-site examinations to ensure that these large institutions are operating in a safe and sound manner, but rather must be assured that their risk management practices and internal controls are sound on an on-going basis. Still, on-site examinations, in my judgment, remain critical. However, on-site examinations must evolve to be both as effective and as unobtrusive as possible. We are devoting substantial efforts to attracting, training, retaining, and using effectively the highly skilled personnel that modern bank examinations require. The new procedures place greater importance on an institution's internal management processes, beginning at the top. Consistent with the view that private agents are the first line of defense against excessive risk, boards of directors are expected to be actively involved in establishing the overall environment for taking risk, staying informed about the level of risks and how they are managed and controlled, and making sure that senior management is capable and has the resources it needs to be successful. Management is expected to develop and implement the policies and procedures needed to conduct a banking business in a safe and sound manner. Internal controls, evaluated by an independent internal auditing function, must be sound. I hope that my brief review of some of the key challenges facing economic policymakers and private participants in banking and financial markets has convinced you, if indeed you needed convincing, that these aspects of the modern world of finance are important, exciting, and deserve the serious attention of all participants. The rewards, current and potential, of modern banking and finance are great. But there are also some very real risks that we need to address in effective, cooperative, and inevitably evolving ways.

6271,r990602a_FOMC,united states,1999-06-02,Trade and technology,greenspan,1,"Trade and technology I am pleased to join the Alliance for the Commonwealth today for its annual Conference on International Business. I should also like to thank my good friends John LaWare, Chairman of the Alliance, and Cathy Minehan, President of the Boston Federal Reserve Bank, who encouraged me to participate in this daylong educational symposium. There are few better examples of the benefits of trade and investment than here in Boston where the roots of international trade go back to our nation's origins. Massachusetts, and New England in general, are today, as in the past, actively engaged in the global trade environment and are currently home to many of the firms that are the recipients or the sources of cross-border direct investment. The evidence is overwhelmingly persuasive that the massive increase in world competition--a consequence of broadening trade flows--has fostered markedly higher standards of living for almost all countries who have participated in cross-border trade. I include most especially the United States. And yet, as I have indicated in recent speeches and intend to outline shortly, there are reasons to be concerned that the benefits of increasingly open trade may not be allowed to be as readily forthcoming in the future as they have been in the past half century. Although many forces have been at play, the post World War II surge in trade has clearly owed, in large part, to significant advances in technological innovation. Since the dawn of the industrial revolution, there has been an inexorable drive to leverage physical brawn and material resources into ever greater value added or output. New insights into the laws of nature brought steam and later electric power. The development of a production quality level that facilitated interchangeable parts brought assembly line production. And the development of railroads facilitated the evolution of mass markets. Almost all of the leverage of the physical to higher value added has reflected the substitution of ideas--new insights--for material bulk and brute human effort. The resulting more effective organization of material has, of course, inevitably meant that less of it was needed per unit of output. The insights of metallurgy and architectural and engineering design, for example, enabled the construction of buildings that use far less physical material per unit of space than say, a half century ago. The insights that led to central heating, as well as synthetic fiber, facilitated reduced clothing weight, while the development of the jet engine brought far greater annual passenger miles per unit of aircraft size. But doubtless it has been the advent in recent decades of the synergies of the microprocessor, lasers, and fiber optics that has fostered a distinct quickening in the displacement of physical weight of output with concepts. The ability to miniaturize transistor electronic circuits has displaced huge tonnages of copper and enhanced the speed of calculation that the miniaturization of circuitry facilitated. As high tech became an increasing part of our national product, the relative physical dimensions of our value added fell dramatically. The per capita physical weight of our gross domestic product is evidently only scarcely higher today than it was fifty or one hundred years ago. By far the largest contributor to growth of our price-adjusted GDP, or value added, has been ideas--insights that leveraged physical reality. The consequent downsizing of output, of course, meant that products were easier, and hence less costly, to move, and most especially across national borders. It is thus not surprising that the price-adjusted level of international trade, as I indicated earlier, has expanded at a far faster pace than gains in real domestic demand. Imports of goods and services as a percent of gross domestic products worldwide, on average, have risen from approximately 14 percent twenty-five years ago to 24 percent today. The growth in physical weight of such trade, as with the national product generally, has been far less. For example, United States data on both exports and imports indicates that the price-adjusted value of our trade per pound has risen by approximately 4 percent per year on average over those same three decades. But technology has augmented international trade for reasons beyond the downsizing of material output. New telecommunications technologies made it very difficult for the autarchic societies of the former Soviet Union to sustain their isolation in the face of the growing relative affluence of the West. News could no longer be bottled up. Even in the West, the stultification of protectionism became increasingly evident as new consumer products entered the world markets en masse. The political pressures to deregulate moribund industries and open up borders to trade soon became irresistible. The international trading system that evolved has enhanced competition and fostered the continuous scrapping of old technologies to make way for the new. Standards of living rise because the depreciation and other cash flows of industries employing older, increasingly obsolescent, technologies are marshaled to finance the newly produced capital assets that almost always embody the cutting edge technologies. This is the process by which wealth is created incremental step by incremental step. It presupposes a continuous churning of an economy in which the new displaces the old. But there is also little doubt that this transition to the new high-tech economy, of which rising trade is a part, is proving difficult for a large segment of our workforce that interfaces with our rapidly changing capital stock day-by-day. Moreover, while major advances in standards of living are evident among virtually all nations that have opened their borders to increased competition, the adjustment trauma has also distressed those who once thrived in companies that were then at the cutting edge of technology, but which have since become increasingly less competitive in both domestic and foreign markets. Economists will say that workers should move from the steel districts of western Pennsylvania to a vibrant Silicon Valley. And eventually they, or more likely, their children, will. But the adjustment process is wrenching to an existing workforce made redundant largely through no fault of their own. It may be argued that all workers should have the foresight to recognize long-term job opportunity shifts and move in advance of obsolescence. This regrettably is a skill not in great abundance--among business managers or the economists who counsel them, as well as among workers. Yet the protectionist propensity to thwart the process of the competitive flow of capital, from failing technologies to the more productive, is unwise and surely self-defeating. History tells us that not only is it unwise to try to hold back innovations, it is also not possible over the longer run. Generation after generation has experienced episodes in which the technologically obsolescent endeavored to undermine progress, often appealing to the very real short-term costs of adjusting to a changing economic environment. From the Luddites to the Smoots and the Hawleys, competitive forces were under attack. In the end they did not prevail and long-term advances in standards of living resumed. Nonetheless, the campaign to expand free trade is never won. Legislation to further lower trade barriers, for example, is becoming increasingly more difficult to pass in our Congress. It is a continuing battle. Further, while tariffs in industrial countries have come down sharply over the past half century, other barriers have become more prevalent. Administrative protection in the form of antidumping suits and countervailing duties is a case in point. While these forms of protection have often been imposed under the label of promoting ""fair trade,"" oftentimes they are just simple guises for inhibiting competition. Typically, antidumping duties are levied when foreign average prices are below average cost of production. But that also describes a practice that often emerges as a wholly appropriate response to a softening in demand. It is the rare case that prices fall below marginal cost, which would be a more relevant standard. Antidumping initiatives should be reserved, in the view of many economists, for those cases where anticompetitive behavior is involved. Contrary to popular notions about antidumping suits, under U.S. and WTO law, it is not required to show evidence of predatory behavior, or intention to monopolize, or of any other intentional efforts to drive competitors out of business. In the end it is clear that all economic progress rests on competition. It would be a great tragedy were we to stop the wheels of progress because of an incapacity to assist the victims of progress. Our efforts should be directed at job skills enhancement and retraining--a process in which the private market is already engaged. Thwarting competition, by placing barriers to imports, will prevent the needed transitions of the productive capital stock of the United States and other nations that enable it to continuously concentrate on producing those goods and services most desired by consumers. Protectionism will also slow the inevitable transition of the workforce to more productive endeavors. To be sure, an added few years may enable some workers to reach retirement with dignity, but it will also keep frozen in place younger workers whose better job opportunities decline with time. I regret that trade policy has been inextricably linked with job creation. We try to promote free trade on the mistaken ground that it will create jobs. The reason should be that it enhances standards of living through the effects of competition on productivity. It is difficult to find credible evidence that trade has impacted the level of total employment in this country over the long run. Indeed, we are currently experiencing the widest trade deficit in history with a level of unemployment close to record lows. Certainly, the distribution of jobs by industry is affected by international trade, but it is also affected by domestic trade. It is the relative balance of supply and demand in a competitive market economy that determines the mix of employment. When exports fall or imports rise, domestic demand and relative prices have invariably adjusted in the long run to leave total employment relatively unaffected. As economists like to say, all imports are eventually paid for with exports. I also regret that, despite the remarkable success over a near half century of GATT, the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs, and its successor, the World Trade Organization, in reducing trade barriers, our trade laws and negotiating practices are essentially adversarial. They presume that a trade concession extracted from us by our trading partners is to their advantage at our expense, and must be countered. Few economists see the world that way. And I am rash enough to suggest that we economists are correct, at least in this regard: trade is not a zero sum game. If trade barriers are lowered by both parties, each clearly benefits. But if one lowers barriers and the other does not, the country that lowered barriers unilaterally would still be better off having done so. Raising barriers to achieve protectionist equality with reluctant trading partners would be neither to our benefit, nor to theirs. The best of all possible worlds for competition is for both parties to lower trade barriers. The worst is for both to keep them up. For these reasons, I am concerned about the recent evident weakening of support for free trade in this country. Should we endeavor to freeze competitive progress in place, we will almost certainly slow economic growth overall, and impart substantial harm to those workers who would otherwise seek more effective longer-term job opportunities. Protecting markets from new technologies has never succeeded. Adjustments to newer technologies have been delayed, but only at significant cost. Even should our trading partners not retaliate in the face of increased American trade barriers, an unlikely event, we do ourselves great harm by lessening the vigor of American competitiveness. The United States has been in the forefront of the postwar opening up of international markets, much to our, and the rest of the world's, benefit. It would be a great tragedy were that process reversed. I do not believe that will be allowed to happen. There is too much at stake for us and our trading partners.

6279,r990827a_FOMC,united states,1999-08-27,New challenges for monetary policy,greenspan,1,"New challenges for monetary policy I should like as a backdrop to this conference on the challenges confronting monetary policy to focus on certain aspects of one of the issues that will be more broadly discussed later this morning: asset pricing and macroeconomic performance. As the value of assets and liabilities have risen relative to income, we have been confronted with the potential for our economies to exhibit larger and perhaps more abrupt responses to changes in factors affecting the balance sheets of households and businesses. As a result, our analytic tools are going to have to increasingly focus on changes in asset values and resulting balance sheet variations if we are to understand these important economic forces. Central bankers, in particular, are going to have to be able to ascertain how changes in the balance sheets of economic actors influence real economic activity and, hence, affect appropriate macroeconomic policies. At root, all asset values rest on perceptions of the future. A motor vehicle assembly plant is a pile of junk if no participants in a market economy perceive it capable of turning out cars and trucks of use to consumers and profit to producers. Likewise, the scrap value at the end of the plant's service life will be positive only if it is convertible into usable products. The value ascribed to any asset is a discounted value of future expected returns, even if no market participant consciously makes that calculation. In principle, forward discounting lies behind the valuation of all assets, from an apple that is about to be consumed to a hydroelectric plant with a hundred-year life expectancy. On such judgments of value rest much of our economic system. Doubtless, valuations are shaped in part, perhaps in large part, by the economic process itself. But history suggests that they also reflect waves of optimism and pessimism that can be touched off by seemingly small exogenous events. This morning, I plan to address some of the problems that arise in evaluating the prices of equities. I should like to first focus on some significant difficulties of profit accounting that impede judgments about prospective earnings. In particular, there are some difficulties that have become more severe as a consequence of the recent acceleration of technologies, which, in turn, are markedly altering patterns of economic organization and production. And then I will discuss a different set of forces that mold the development of discount factors which, together with earnings projections, produce estimates of market value. First, the rapid shift in the composition of gross domestic product toward idea-based value added is muddying our measures of current earnings and, hence, our projections of future earnings. The key definitional question that must be confronted is, What is a capital outlay? Conversely, What is an expense that, by definition, is consumed in the process of production and deemed an intermediate product? This issue is most immediately evident in accounting for software outlays, but it is rapidly expanding to a much broader range of activities. Software that is embedded in capital equipment, and some that is stand-alone, is currently being capitalized and consequently amortized against current and future earnings. But a substantial portion of software spending is expensed, even though the equity prices of the purchasing companies are clearly valuing the software outlays as contributing to earnings over their useful economic lives--the relevant criterion for capitalizing an asset. There has always been a fuzzy dividing line between what is expensed and what is capitalized. This has historically bedeviled the accounting for research and development, for example. But the major technological advances of recent years have exposed a wide swath of rapidly growing outlays that, arguably, should be capitalized so that the returns they produce would be more accurately reflected as earnings over time. Indeed, there is even an argument for capitalizing new ideas, such as different ways of organizing production, that enhance the value of a firm without any associated outlays. Some analysts judge the size of undercapitalized outlays as quite large. The important point, however, is that decisions about which items to expense will have important consequences for reported earnings. In general, if the trend of expensed items that should be capitalized is rising faster than reported earnings, switching to capitalizing these items will almost always accelerate the growth in earnings. The reverse, of course, is also true. But the newer technologies, and the productivity and bull stock market they have fostered, are also accentuating some accounting difficulties that tend to bias up reported earnings. One is the apparent overestimate of earnings that occurs as a result of the distortion in the accounting for stock options. The combination of not charging their fair value against income, and the practice of periodically repricing those options that fall significantly out of the money , serves to understate ongoing labor compensation charges against corporate earnings. This distortion, all else equal, has overstated growth of reported profits according to Fed staff calculations by one to two percentage points annually during the past five years. Similarly, the rise in stock prices, which reduces corporate contributions to pension funds is also augmenting reported profits. These upward adjustments in reported earnings, of course, are a consequence of rising stock prices and, hence, may not be of the same dimension in the future. Nonetheless, it is reasonable to surmise that undercapitalized expenses have been rising sufficiently faster than reported earnings to have more than offset the factors that have temporarily augmented reported earnings. It does not seem likely, however, even should all of the appropriate accounting adjustments to earnings be made, that such adjustments can be the central explanation of the extraordinary increase in stock prices over the past five years. However we calculate profits and capital, shifts in the stock market value of firms will doubtless continue to remain important influences on our economies. It is thus incumbent on us to improve our understanding of the process by which projections of future earnings are translated into asset market value. Even our most sophisticated analytic techniques have difficulty dealing with the interactions among time preference, risk aversion, and uncertainty and with the implications of these interactions for the risk premiums that are embedded in asset prices. It is our failure to anticipate changes in this discounting process that much of our inability to accurately forecast economic events lies. For example, the dramatic changes in information technology that have enabled businesses to embrace the techniques of just-in-time inventory management appear to have reduced that part of the business cycle that is attributable to inventory fluctuations and, accordingly, may well have been a factor in the apparent decline in equity premiums that has characterized the latter part of the 1990s. Whether the decline in these premiums themselves may foster activities that could result in wider business cycles, as some maintain, is an open question. As model builders know, all economic channels of influence are not of equal power to engender growth or contraction. Of crucial importance, and still most elusive, is arguably the behavior of asset markets. More broadly, there is an increasing need to integrate into our macro models more complete descriptions of the responses of households and businesses to risk--behaviors that are generally modeled separately under the rubric of portfolio risk management. The translation of value judgments into market prices is, of course, rooted in how people discount uncertain future outcomes. An individual's degree of risk aversion may vary through time and possibly be subject to herd instincts. Nonetheless, certain stable magnitudes are inferable from the process of discounting of future claims and values. One of the most enduring is that interest rates, as far back as we can measure, appear trendless, despite vast changes in technology, life expectancy, and economic organization. British long-term government interest rates, for example, mostly ranged between three percent and six percent from the early eighteenth century to the early twentieth century, and are around five percent today. Indeed, scattered evidence dating back to ancient Rome and before reflects the same order of interest rate magnitude, not a one percent interest rate nor 200 percent. This suggests that the rate of time preference underlying interest rates, like so many other aspects of human nature, has not materially changed over the generations. But while time preference may appear to be relatively stable over history, perceptions of risk and uncertainty, which couple with time preference to create discount factors, obviously vary widely, as does liquidity preference, itself a function of uncertainty. The impact of increasing uncertainty and risk aversion was no more evident than in the crisis that gripped financial markets last autumn, following the Russian default. That episode of investor fright has largely dissipated. But left unanswered is the question of why such episodes erupt in the first place. It has become evident time and again that when events are unexpected, more complex, and move more rapidly than is the norm, human beings become less able to cope. The failure to be able to comprehend external events almost invariably induces fear and, hence, disengagement from an activity, whether it be entering a dark room or taking positions in markets. And attempts to disengage from markets that are net long--the most general case--means bids are hit and prices fall. Modern quantitative approaches to risk measurement and risk management take as their starting point historical experience with market price fluctuations, which is statistically summarized in probability distributions. We live in what is, for the most part, a stable economic system, where market imbalances that produce unusual outcomes almost always give rise to continuous and inevitable moves back toward longer-run equilibrium. However, the violence of the responses to what seemed to be relatively mild imbalances in Southeast Asia in 1997 and throughout the global economy in August and September of 1998 has illustrated yet again that the adjustments in asset markets can be discontinuous, especially when investors hold highly leveraged positions and when views about long-term equilibria are not firmly held. Enough investors usually adopt strategies that take account of longer-run tendencies to foster the propensity for convergence toward equilibrium. But from time to time, this process has broken down as investors suffer an abrupt collapse of comprehension of, and confidence in, future economic events. It is almost as though, like a dam under mounting water pressure, confidence appears normal until the moment it is breached. Risk aversion in such an instance rises dramatically, and deliberate trading strategies are replaced by rising fear-induced disengagement. Yield spreads on relatively risky assets widen dramatically. In the more extreme manifestation, the inability to differentiate among degrees of risk drives trading strategies to ever-more-liquid instruments so investors can immediately reverse decisions at minimum cost should that be required. As a consequence, even among riskless assets, such as U.S. Treasury securities, liquidity premiums rise sharply as investors seek the heavily traded ""on-the-run"" issues--a behavior that was so evident last fall. History tells us that sharp reversals in confidence happen abruptly, most often with little advance notice. These reversals can be self-reinforcing processes that can compress sizable adjustments into a very short time period. Panic market reactions are characterized by dramatic shifts in behavior to minimize short-term losses. Claims on far-distant future values are discounted to insignificance. What is so intriguing is that this type of behavior has characterized human interaction with little appreciable difference over the generations. Whether Dutch tulip bulbs or Russian equities, the market price patterns remain much the same. We can readily describe this process, but, to date, economists have been unable to anticipate sharp reversals in confidence. Collapsing confidence is generally described as a bursting bubble, an event incontrovertibly evident only in retrospect. To anticipate a bubble about to burst requires the forecast of a plunge in the prices of assets previously set by the judgments of millions of investors, many of whom are highly knowledgeable about the prospects for the specific companies that make up our broad stock price indexes. If episodic recurrences of ruptured confidence are integral to the way our economy and our financial markets work now and in the future, it has significant implications for risk management and, by implication, macroeconomic modeling and monetary policy. Probability distributions that are estimated largely, or exclusively, over cycles excluding periods of panic will underestimate the probability of extreme price movements because they fail to capture a secondary peak at the extreme negative tail that reflects the probability of occurrence of a panic. Furthermore, joint distributions estimated over periods without panics will misestimate the degree of correlation between asset returns during panics. Under these circumstances, fear and disengagement by investors often result in simultaneous declines in the values of private obligations, as investors no longer realistically differentiate among degrees of risk and liquidity, and increases in the values of riskless government securities. Consequently, the benefits of portfolio diversification will tend to be overestimated when the rare panic periods are not taken into account. As we make progress, hopefully, toward understanding asset-pricing mechanisms, we need also to upgrade our insights into the effect of changing asset values on GDP--the so-called wealth effect. Although many aspects of this issue deserve attention, let me cite a few open questions of particular importance. Efforts to differentiate between realized and unrealized gains, and the propensity to leverage both, may afford a deeper understanding of the consequences of asset price change. And differentiating between gains that arise from enhanced profitability and those that reflect changes in discount factors may also be useful. The former may be more likely to be sustained, given the tendencies of discount factors to revert back to historic norms. Moreover, it is evident that borrowings against capital gains on homes influence consumer outlays beyond the effects of gains from financial assets. Preliminary work at the Federal Reserve suggests that the extraction of equity from housing has played an important role in recent years. However, stock market values and capital gains on homes are correlated and, hence, their separate effects are difficult to identify. This is an area that clearly warrants further examination. Finally, in the business sector, questions remain about the influence of equity prices on investment spending. In particular, Do all equity price movements--whether related to fundamentals or not--have the same effect on investment spending? In conclusion, the issues that I have touched on this morning are of increasing importance for monetary policy. We no longer have the luxury to look primarily to the flow of goods and services, as conventionally estimated, when evaluating the macroeconomic environment in which monetary policy must function. There are important--but extremely difficult--questions surrounding the behavior of asset prices and the implications of this behavior for the decisions of households and businesses. Accordingly, we have little choice but to confront the challenges posed by these questions if we are to understand better the effect of changes in balance sheets on the economy and, hence, indirectly, on monetary policy. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) will require that the cost of repricing of options be charged against income starting later this year.

6346,r000711a_FOMC,united states,2000-07-11,Structural change in the new economy,greenspan,1,"Structural change in the new economy I am pleased to have the opportunity to meet with you today and address the remarkable changes that have been occurring in our economy. The current economic expansion has not simply set a new record for longevity. More important, the recent period has been marked by a transformation to an economy that is more productive as competitive forces become increasingly intense and new technologies raise the efficiency of our businesses. With the rapid adoption of information technology, the share of output that is conceptual rather than physical continues to grow. While these tendencies were no doubt in train in the ""old,"" pre-1990s economy, they accelerated over the past decade as a number of technologies with their roots in the cumulative innovations of the past half-century began to yield dramatic economic returns. As governors of our states, you have all been dealing with the practical effects of these shifts, which not only have increased prosperity but also are presenting important new challenges. The process of innovation is, of course, never ending. Indeed, the substitution of physical capital, in which new technologies are embodied, for manual labor is an ongoing trend that began nearly two centuries ago when work in craft shops shifted to factories and then to assembly lines. However, the development of the transistor after World War II appears in retrospect to have initiated a special wave of creative synergies. It brought us the microprocessor, the computer, satellites, and the joining of laser and fiber optic technologies. By the 1990s, these and a number of lesser but critical innovations had fostered an enormous new capacity to capture, analyze, and disseminate information. Indeed, it is the proliferation of information technology throughout the economy that makes the current period appear so different from preceding decades. This remarkable coming together of technologies that we label IT has allowed us to move beyond efficiency gains in routine manual tasks to achieve new levels of productivity in now-routine information-processing tasks that previously depended upon people to compute, sort, and retrieve information for purposes of taking action. As a result, information technologies have begun to alter significantly how we do business and create economic value, often in ways that were not foreseeable even a decade ago. One result of the more-rapid pace of IT innovation has been a visible acceleration of the process that noted economist Joseph Schumpeter many years ago termed ""creative destruction""-- the continuous shift in which emerging technologies push out the old. Today our capital stock is undergoing an increasing pace of renewal through investment of cash flow from older-technology capital equipment and facilities into cutting-edge, more efficient vintages. This process of capital reallocation across the economy has been assisted by a significant unbundling of risks in capital markets made possible by the development of innovative financial products, many of which themselves owe their viability to advances in technology. At the microeconomic level, the essential contribution of information technology is the expansion of knowledge and its obverse, the reduction of uncertainty. Before this recent quantum jump in information availability, businesses had limited and less timely knowledge of customers' needs and of the location of inventories and materials flowing through complex production systems. In that environment, decisions were based on information that was hours, days, or even weeks old. Businesses, to protect production schedules, found it essential, although costly, to carry sizable backup stocks of materials and to keep additional persons on their payrolls for making the necessary adjustments to the inevitable miscalculations and unanticipated shifts in demand for their products and services. Of course, a great deal of imprecision persists, but the remarkable surge in the availability of real-time information has enabled businesses to reduce unnecessary inventory and dispense with labor and capital redundancies. Intermediate production and distribution processes, so essential when information and quality control were poor, are being bypassed or eliminated. There are no indications in the marketplace that the process of re-engineering business operations is slowing, although it has been difficult analytically to disentangle the part of the rise in output per hour that is permanent and that which is the consequence of transitory business cycle forces. The part based on information advances, of course, is irreversible. Having learned to employ bar code and satellite technologies, for example, we are not about to lose our capability in applying them. But until we experience an economic slowdown, we will not know for sure how much of the extraordinary rise in output per hour in the past five years is attributable to the irreversible way value is created and how much reflects endeavors on the part of our business community to stretch existing capital and labor resources in ways that are not sustainable over the longer run. I have stressed information technology's crucial role on the factory floor and in distribution channels. But technological innovation has spread far beyond that. Biotechnology is revolutionizing medicine and agriculture in ways that were unimaginable just a few years ago, with far-reaching consequences for the quality of life not only in the United States but also around the world. Even more intriguing are those as yet unrealized opportunities for computers and information technology to expand our scientific knowledge more generally. As I indicated earlier, the major contribution of advances in information technology and their incorporation into the capital stock has been to reduce the number of worker hours required to produce the nation's output, our proxy for productivity growth. Echoing a debate that is as old as Adam Smith, some view this so-called labor displacing investment and the introduction of innovative production processes as a threat to our economy's capacity to create new jobs. But because technological change spawns so many opportunities for businesses to expand, the introduction of new efficiencies has today, as in the past, created a vibrant economy in which opportunities for new jobs and businesses have blossomed. An intriguing aspect of the recent wave of productivity acceleration is that U.S. businesses and workers appear to have benefited more from the recent advances in information technology than their counterparts in Europe or Japan. Those countries, of course, have also participated in this wave of invention and innovation, but they appear to have been slower to exploit it. The relatively inflexible and, hence, more costly labor markets of these economies appear to be a significant part of the explanation. The elevated rates of return offered by the newer technologies in the United States are largely the result of a reduction in labor costs per unit of output. The rates of return on investment in the same new technologies are correspondingly less in Europe and Japan because businesses there face higher costs of displacing workers than we do. Here, labor displacement is more readily countenanced both by law and by culture. Parenthetically, because our costs of dismissing workers are lower, the potential costs of hiring and the risks associated with expanding employment are less. The result of this significantly higher capacity for job dismissal has been, counterintuitively, a dramatic decline in the U.S. unemployment rate in recent years. But one less welcome byproduct of rapid economic and technological change, and the necessary heightened level of potential job dismissal that goes with it, is the evident insecurity felt by many workers despite the tightest labor markets in decades. This anxiety stems, I suspect, from a fear of job skill obsolescence, and one very tangible measure of it is the pressure on our education and training systems to prepare and adapt workers to effectively run the new technologies. These pressures are likely to remain intense, even though they may wax and wane, because I see nothing to suggest that the trends toward a greater conceptual content of our nation's output and, thus, toward increased demand for conceptual skills in our workforce, will end. The rapidity of innovation and the unpredictability of the directions it may take imply a need for considerable investment in human capital. Even the most significant advances in information and computer technology will produce little additional economic value without human creativity and intellect. The heyday when a high school or college education would serve a graduate for a lifetime is gone; basic credentials, by themselves, are not enough to ensure success in the workplace. Today's recipients of diplomas expect to have many jobs and to use a wide range of skills over their working lives. Their parents and grandparents looked to a more stable future--even if in reality it often turned out otherwise. Workers must be equipped not simply with technical know-how but also with the ability to create, analyze, and transform information and to interact effectively with others. Moreover, learning will increasingly be a lifelong activity. Certainly, the notion that human and physical capital are complements is not new. Technological advance has inevitably brought with it improvements not only in the capital inputs used in production but also new demands on workers who must interact with that increasingly more complex stock of capital. Early in this century, these advances required workers with a higher level of cognitive skills, for instance the ability to read manuals, to interpret blueprints, or to understand formulae. Our educational system responded: In the 1920s and 1930s, high school enrollment in this country expanded rapidly, pulling youth from rural areas, where opportunities were limited, into more productive occupations in business and broadening the skills of students to meet the needs of an advancing manufacturing sector. It became the job of these institutions to prepare students for work life, not just for a transition to college. In the context of the demands of the economy at that time, a high school diploma represented the training needed to be successful in most aspects of American enterprise. The economic returns for having a high school diploma rose and, as a result, high school enrollment rates climbed. At the same time, our system of higher education was also responding to the advances in economic processes. Although many states had established land grant schools earlier, their support accelerated in the late nineteenth century as those whose economies specialized in agriculture and mining sought to take advantage of new scientific methods of production. Early in the twentieth century, the content of education at an American college had evolved from a classically based curriculum to one combining the sciences, empirical studies, and modern liberal arts. Universities responded to the need for the application of science--particularly chemistry and physics--to the manufacture of steel, rubber, chemicals, drugs, petroleum, and other goods requiring the newer production technologies. Communities looked to their institutions of higher learning for leadership in scientific knowledge and for training of professionals such as teachers and engineers. The scale and scope of higher education in America was being shaped by the recognition that research--the creation of knowledge--complemented teaching and training--the diffusion of knowledge. In a global environment in which prospects for economic growth now depend importantly on a country's capacity to develop and apply new technologies, our universities are envied around the world. The payoffs--in terms of the flow of expertise, new products, and startup companies, for example--have been impressive. Here, perhaps the most frequently cited measures of our success have been the emergence of significant centers of commercial innovation and entrepreneurship where creative ideas flow freely between local academic scholars and those in industry. Not all that long ago, it was easy to recite a relatively short list of places where these activities were clustered. But we have witnessed in recent years a great multiplicity of these centers of innovation. State support, both for the university system and for small businesses, has been an important element in the vitality of these centers. Certainly, if we are to remain preeminent in transforming knowledge into economic value, the U.S. system of higher education must remain the world's leader in generating scientific and technological breakthroughs and in preparing workers to meet the evolving demands for skilled labor. With two-thirds of our high school graduates now enrolling in college and an increasing proportion of adult workers seeking opportunities for retooling, our institutions of higher learning increasingly bear an important responsibility for ensuring that our society is prepared for the demands of rapid economic change. Equally critical to our investment in human capital is the quality of education in our elementary and secondary schools. As you know, the results of international comparisons of student achievement in mathematics and science, which indicated that performance of U.S. twelfth-grade students fell short of their peers in other countries, heightened the debate about the quality of education below the college level. To be sure, substantial reforms in math and science education have been under way for some time, and I am encouraged that policymakers, educators, and the business community recognize the significant contribution that a stronger elementary and secondary education system will make in boosting the potential productivity of new generations of workers. I hope that we will see that the efforts to date have paid off in raising the achievement of U.S. students when the results of the 1998-99 international comparisons for eighth graders are published. Whatever the outcome, the pressures to advance our education system will continue to be intense. As the conceptual share of the value added in our economic processes expands further, the ability to think abstractly will be increasingly important across a broad range of professions. Critical awareness and the abilities to hypothesize, to interpret, and to communicate are essential elements of successful innovation in a conceptual-based economy. As with many skills, such learning is most effective when it is begun at an early age. And most educators believe that exposure to a wide range of subjects--including literature, music, art, and languages--plays a considerable role in fostering the development of these skills. As you know, school districts are also being challenged to evaluate how new information technologies can be best employed in their curricula. Unfortunately, this goal has too often been narrowly interpreted as teaching students how to type on the computer or permitting students to research projects over the Internet. Incorporating new technologies into the educational process is indeed likely to be an important element in improving our schools, but it must involve more than simply wiring the classroom. Human capital--in the form of our teachers--and technology are complements in producing education output just as they are in other business activities. To achieve the most effective outcome from new technologies, we must provide teachers with the necessary training to use them effectively and to provide forums for teachers and education researchers to share ideas and approaches on how best to integrate technology into the curriculum. And we must create partnerships among the states, the school systems, labor and industry to develop appropriate standards and guidelines for the teaching of information technology in the classroom. A crucial concern today--and I know that the National Governors' Association is working hard to address this issue--is that the supply of qualified teachers will be insufficient to meet the demand. Indeed, a substantial number of teachers are scheduled to retire over the next decade, and how to replace them and meet the additional demand from rising enrollments is certain to be a significant challenge in the years ahead. Finally, the pressure to enlarge the pool of skilled workers also means that we must strengthen the significant contributions of other types of training and educational programs, especially for those with lesser skills. It is not enough to create a job market that has enabled those with few skills to finally grasp the first rung of the ladder to achievement. More generally, we must ensure that our whole population receives an education that will allow full and continuing participation in this dynamic period of American economic history. We need to foster a flexible education system--one that integrates work and training and that serves the needs both of experienced workers at different stages in their careers and of students embarking on their initial course of study. Community colleges, for example, have become important providers of job skills training not just for students who may eventually move on to a four-year college or university but for individuals with jobs--particularly older workers seeking to retool or retrain. The increasing availability of courses that can be ""taken at a distance"" over the Internet means that learning can more easily occur outside the workplace or the classroom--an innovation that may be particularly valuable for states with large rural populations for whom access to traditional classroom learning is more difficult. In summary, we are in a period of rapid innovation that is bringing with it enormous opportunities to enhance living standards for a large majority of Americans. Our ability to take advantage of these opportunities is not only influenced by national policies but is also determined importantly at the state level. States with more flexible labor markets, skilled work forces, and a reputation for supporting innovation and entrepreneurship will be prime locations for firms at the cutting edge of technology. Not all new enterprises will succeed, of course. But many will, and those that do will provide the impetus for further economic progress and expanding opportunities in their communities. Your leadership as policymakers will be a key element in promoting an environment in which you join with others in business, labor, and education to realize the potential that technological change has for bringing substantial and lasting benefits to our economy.

6377,r010323a_FOMC,united states,2001-03-23,NO_INFO,gramlich,0,"I am pleased to participate in today's conference on predatory lending. This seems to have become a major problem around the country, as in Ohio. Conferences such as this provide a valuable opportunity to learn more about this very complex topic. One of the welcome developments in recent years is the expansion of the home mortgage market to a broader socioeconomic range of borrowers. Studies of urban metropolitan data submitted under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) have shown that lower-income and minority consumers, who have traditionally had difficulty in getting mortgage credit, have been taking out loans at record levels in recent years. Specifically, conventional home-purchase mortgage lending to low-income borrowers nearly doubled between 1993 and 1999, whereas that to upper-income borrowers rose 56 percent. Also over the same period, conventional mortgage lending increased by about 120 percent to African-American and Hispanic borrowers, compared with an increase of 48 percent to white borrowers. Much of this increased lending can be attributed to the development of the subprime mortgage market. Again using HMDA data, the number of subprime home equity loans has grown from 66,000 in 1993 to 856,000 in 1999, a thirteen-fold increase. Over this same period, the number of subprime loans to purchase homes increased sixteen-fold, from 16,000 to 263,000. This rapid growth has given credit access to consumers who have difficulty in meeting the underwriting criteria of prime lenders because of blemished credit histories or other aspects of their profiles. This expansion of credit gives people from all walks of life a shot at the twin American dreams of owning a home and building wealth. But along with these positive developments have come disquieting reports of abusive lending practices, targeted particularly at female, elderly, and minority borrowers. These practices, many of which can result in consumers' losing much of their equity in their home, or even the home itself, are commonly referred to as ""predatory lending."" Predatory lending can damage these same hardworking but low-income people and the communities in which they live. Its growth is a noticeable blight in this otherwise attractive mortgage-lending picture. The term ""predatory lending,"" much like the terms ""safety and soundness"" and ""unfair and deceptive practices,"" is far-reaching and covers a potentially broad range of behavior. As such, it does not lend itself to a concise or a comprehensive definition. But typically predatory lending involves at least one, and perhaps all three, of the following elements: making unaffordable loans based on the assets of the borrower rather than on the borrower's ability to repay an obligation (""asset-based lending"") inducing a borrower to refinance a loan repeatedly in order to charge high points and fees each time the loan is refinanced (""loan flipping"") engaging in fraud or deception to conceal the true nature of the loan obligation from an unsuspecting or unsophisticated borrower. Some of these practices are clearly illegal and can be combated with legal enforcement measures. But some are more subtle, involving the misuse of practices that most of the time can improve credit market efficiency. For example, the freedom for loan rates to rise above former usury law ceilings is generally desirable in that it matches relatively risky borrowers with appropriate lenders. But sometimes the payments implicit in very high interest rates can spell financial ruin for borrowers. Most of the time, balloon payments make it possible for young homeowners to buy their first house and match payments with their rising income stream. But sometimes balloon payments can ruin borrowers who do not have a rising income stream or who are unduly influenced by an immediate need for money. Most of the time, the ability to refinance mortgages permits borrowers to take advantage of lower mortgage rates, but sometimes easy refinancing invites loan flipping, resulting in high loan fees and unnecessary credit costs. Often credit life insurance is desirable, but sometimes the insurance is unnecessary, and at times borrowers pay hefty up-front premiums as their loans are flipped. Generally advertising enhances information, but sometimes it is deceptive. Most of the time, disclosure of mortgage terms is desirable, but sometimes disclosures are misleading, with key points hidden in the fine print. Predatory lending entails either fraud or the misuse of these and other complex mortgage provisions that are generally desirable and advantageous to a borrower, but only when the borrower fully understands them. The Congress has passed a number of consumer protection statutes in this area. One important law is the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA) of 1994, an amendment to the earlier Truth in Lending Act. Among other things, HOEPA requires that the Federal Reserve Board periodically conduct public hearings to gather information about trends within the home equity market. This summer the Board held a second round of HOEPA hearings in Charlotte, Boston, Chicago, and San Francisco. Earlier hearings had been held in 1997 and had led to a joint report to the Congress from the Board and HUD. The basic approach of HOEPA is to shine a bright spotlight on high-cost mortgage loans. For these high-cost loans, certain practices--balloon payments in the first five years, prepayment penalties, and a pattern and practice of asset-based lending--are banned. In addition, for HOEPA-covered loans, creditors must provide a short disclosure to borrowers three days before the loan is closed; loans under HOEPA are also subject to the normal three-day rescission period that pertains to other home equity loans. This gives many HOEPA borrowers twice as long to change their minds about possibly unwise mortgage contracts. HOEPA is not a usury law--high-cost loans can still be made--but borrowers' protections are significantly greater for HOEPA loans than for other subprime mortgage loans. Last December 13 the Board solicited comments on proposed revisions to our Regulation Z, the regulation implementing HOEPA. The goal of the changes was to curb some abuses we were made aware of during our hearings and through other sources. At the same time, we tried to make our amendments narrow and selective so as not to impede the general growth of the legitimate subprime mortgage market. The important changes involved broadening the scope of mortgage loans subject to HOEPA coverage and prohibiting specific acts and practices. With respect to loans subject to HOEPA, the law lays out a two-part test for coverage. The first involves interest rates. If the annual percentage rate (APR) on a mortgage loan exceeds the Treasury rate on a bond of comparable maturity by more than 10 percentage points, the loan is subject to HOEPA protections. The Board has the legal authority to lower this threshold to 8 percentage points, and the proposal recommends doing that. Data on this segment of the mortgage market are sparse, but a special survey by the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) estimates that the portion of subprime mortgage loans falling within the HOEPA's APR trigger is currently about 1 percent, with this segment of the market rising to about 5 percent under the proposal. From this standpoint, the effect of this change on the general growth in subprime mortgage lending should be modest. But these percentages are based on rates alone, and many subprime lenders feel that the coverage percentages are higher when the second HOEPA test enters in. Under this second test, loans with non-interest fees of more than 8 percent of the loan amount, or $465, are covered by HOEPA. Although the Board cannot change these amounts, it can alter the items included in this points and fees test. The proposal recommends adding premiums on single-premium credit insurance to the points and fees test. Premiums for this insurance are generally financed in the loan amount, the insurance is often unnecessary, and premiums may be difficult to recover if the loan is cancelled. When loans are flipped, financed single-premiums for credit insurance can be a way to strip equity from a homeowner. We do not know how many additional mortgage loans this change would bring under HOEPA, but it is likely to greatly constrict the selling of single-premium credit insurance. Under the proposal, the provisions regarding other ways of selling credit insurance would not change, and these alternative ways of selling credit insurance would thereby be encouraged. These changes would extend the coverage of HOEPA and its consumer protection provisions. Presumably, the number of subprime foreclosures would be lessened. But because HOEPA loans are already more costly to make and they carry a stigma in the secondary market, these changes may also constrict lending in the very high cost segment of the subprime market. Many consumer advocates have said that they are aware of this possible tradeoff and accept it. Now that the proposed revisions to the regulation are out for public comment, we will be able to examine the responses in more detail. The Board proposal also prohibits a number of specific acts and practices. There are two provisions to reduce loan flipping. The proposal would prohibit a creditor that holds a HOEPA loan from refinancing the original credit with another high-cost loan within twelve months of origination. The proposal would also prohibit creditors from refinancing with higher-rate loans certain zero-interest loans or other very low cost loans originated through mortgage assistance programs. Both provisions have an escape clause that permits these refinancings if the creditor can show that the loan is in the borrower's interest, a provision likely to come into play in foreclosures or other legal proceedings in connection with the loan. Together these provisions should reduce the most egregious instances of loan flipping--where creditors either flip loans immediately on origination or refinance very low interest loans at much higher rates. The proposal also tries to stem the practice of making loans that are not based on the borrower's ability to repay an obligation, so-called asset-based lending. The proposal would require that lenders document and verify consumers' ability to repay HOEPA loans. Because a pattern or practice of making asset-based HOEPA loans is already prohibited, legitimate subprime lenders presumably already have procedures to show that they are not engaged in a pattern or practice of making asset-based loans. Consequently, this provision should not affect effect legitimate subprime lenders, though it should deter predatory lenders, who will have difficulty proving the legitimacy of their asset-based credit decisions. These recommendations often reflect hard tradeoffs with potentially significant effects on creditors and consumers alike. The Board will have to undertake a difficult balancing effort when it adopts a final rule. It will be essential that we receive thoughtful comments from all segments of the public and from the industry to help us make an informed final decision. About the same time, last November 29, the Board also solicited comments on proposed revisions to our Regulation C, which implements the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA). HMDA requires depository and certain for-profit nondepository institutions to collect, report, and disclose data about applications for, originations of, and purchases of home-mortgage and home-improvement loans. From these data denial rates can be inferred. Data now reported include the type, purpose, and amount of the loan; the race or national origin, gender, and income of the loan applicant; and the location of the property. The purposes of these HMDA reports include helping us to determine whether financial institutions are serving the housing needs of their communities and to enforce fair lending. The Board's proposal incorporates suggestions received in response to an earlier Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, as well as from discussions with a wide range of interested parties. In evaluating potential changes, the Board considered whether the changes would improve the quality and utility of the resulting data to enhance understanding of the home mortgage market. At the same time, the Board attempted to minimize the increase in data- collection costs and reporting burden by limiting proposed changes to those likely to have significant benefits. As we have done in the past, we will make available software to help reduce the reporting burden for financial institutions. The three fundamental changes in the proposal would increase the number of nondepository lenders required to submit data clarify and expand the types of reportable transactions specify new loan elements to be included in the data. First, with respect to the coverage of nondepository lenders, the Board's proposal would alter definitions to require all nondepository lenders whose annual home purchase and refinancing activity comprises at least 10 percent of the dollar value of all their loan originations (mortgage- and nonmortgage-related), or $50 million, to report HMDA data. The new element is the $50 million reporting floor, which extends HMDA coverage to very large nonbank lenders with relatively small percentages of mortgage loans in their portfolios. Because the added coverage affects very large mortgage lenders, it seems consistent with any reasonable test of determining whether a lender is ""engaged in the business of mortgage lending,"" the statute's test for coverage. Second, the expansion of the types of transactions covered is intended to improve the integrity of the data by establishing consistency in reporting requirements. Right now, data on refinancings and home improvement loans are unclear, and quite likely incomplete, because the regulation provides lenders with much flexibility in determining which loans to report. For example, lenders may avoid reporting closed-end home improvement loans by not classifying them as such in their records. Lenders also may choose not to report open-end home equity lines of credit, even if used for home improvement. The proposal would tighten these definitions so that the resulting data would be more complete and more consistent from one lender to the next. This change, too, certainly seems consistent with the spirit of HMDA. Third, the proposal specifies that three new items be reported from a consumer loan or application: the APR, whether the loan is subject to HOEPA, and whether the loan involves a manufactured home. Having APR and HOEPA information will assist in the identification of subprime loans, enabling better analysis of the high-cost subprime market. We will be able, among other things, to ascertain with much more precision the extent of present HOEPA coverage and the way that coverage might change were the Board to extend its HOEPA coverage, as discussed above. The collection of data on mobile or manufactured home loans will contribute to an improved understanding of this type of lending, which employs different underwriting criteria from those for loans secured by conventional homes. Because manufactured home loans have much higher denial rates than other mortgage loans, such data would also enhance understanding of denial patterns in this market. Again, the Board tried to balance competing interests in fashioning this proposal. As with HOEPA, it will be critical that the Board receives thoughtful public comment on the proposal to assist it in making its final rule on this regulation. Other steps may need to be taken, and may be taken, to deal with predatory lending. But these proposals should represent important first steps. The HOEPA changes extend the coverage and protections of HOEPA and limit some current practices that may end in abuse. The HMDA changes should greatly improve our information about lending practices for high-cost mortgages. Both proposals may limit abusive practices in the short-run and should greatly improve our knowledge and enforcement ability in the long-run. At the same time, the HOEPA proposal is designed to interfere minimally with the vast bulk of subprime lending, and the HMDA proposal is designed to gather useful data while limiting reporting burden. Going beyond these regulatory and data-collection measures, we should all recognize that in the long-run the very best defense against predatory lending is probably in neither of these approaches. Rather, it is in a thorough knowledge on the part of consumers of their credit options and resources. Educated borrowers who understand their rights under lending contracts and who know how to exercise those rights put up the best defense against predatory lenders. As the knowledge base of consumers grows, the market for credit-at-any-cost diminishes. Unfortunately, as is often the case, the best long-run solutions can be the most difficult to implement. A massive educational campaign is needed to bring about this expanded consumer knowledge, particularly within the socioeconomic groups most likely affected by predatory lending. Many efforts are under way. As one example, the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation, a publicly funded entity that is known for its community training and homebuyer counseling programs, has embarked on a huge low-income-homeowner education project. As another, the American Bankers Association has formed a working group to educate bankers and local communities about predatory lending. We in the Federal Reserve System are also trying to do our part. We have undertaken many projects designed to promote community and consumer education and financial literacy. Board staff have been active in an interagency task force convened to identify strategies for combating predatory lending. This group is also looking for ways to support the broad array of organizations that offer consumer and community education to complement homeowner education efforts. We have also been active in planning conferences on the topic, similar to today's conference. Further, nearly every one of the twelve Reserve Banks has published articles devoted to predatory lending in its Community Affairs newsletters. In aggregate, these reach tens of thousands of community development and housing organizations nationwide. The Federal Reserve Banks of Atlanta, Philadelphia, and right here in Cleveland have sponsored seminars to educate community leaders and lenders on the differences between legitimate subprime lending and predatory lending. These meetings have also provided a forum for groups assisting victims to report the most egregious practices of unscrupulous lenders and the devastating impact of these loans on their clients. Federal Reserve Bank of Boston staff members have worked closely with a secondary market purchaser to promote an educational campaign through local community groups. Chicago Reserve Bank officials have facilitated a task force of area advocacy groups, lenders, and real estate industry representatives to help develop recommendations for combating predatory lending. The Chicago Fed has also launched ""Project Money Smart,"" a resource on its web site that provides a comprehensive overview of consumer information on personal finance topics, including managing credit, understanding mortgages, and protection against fraud. And the Dallas Fed has published ""Building Wealth,"" a manual designed to help individuals and families develop a plan for building personal wealth. This Bank's web site offers an interactive tool for customizing wealth-building strategies by setting financial goals, seeking guidance, budgeting, saving and investing, and managing debt. These are a few examples of ways in which the Federal Reserve is trying to improve financial literacy in all segments of the population. The educational challenge is difficult, but these initiatives and other collaborative education efforts can greatly improve financial market efficiency. In the long run, they provide the best defense against predatory lending.

6442,r020321a_FOMC,united states,2002-03-21,NO_INFO,bies,0,"Good morning. I am delighted to be here to discuss a variety of issues that I believe are relevant today to directors and senior managers of banks. During my brief term on the Board, I have heard other governors say that they came to Washington expecting to spend most of their time discussing the economy and monetary policy with many of the Board's 225 PhD. economists and then making policy decisions and judgments. Although those activities are, in fact, an important part of the job, my colleagues have typically found that they spend significantly more time on bank supervisory and regulatory matters. I suspect that will be my experience as well, and--as a former banker--I look forward to dealing with these issues from the other side of the table. As I do so, I'm sure I will benefit greatly from opportunities like this one to meet with industry participants. In my comments today, I will address three topics: the financial performance of U.S. banks, in particular, of community banks; the improvements that banks large and small are making in measuring and managing risk; and finally, the responsibilities of directors and senior managers in corporate governance. In my view, these topics are integrally linked and, in light of current questions of confidence in America's corporations, quite timely. Last year was exceptional in many respects, with the United States slipping into what appears to have been a mild recession, and with the terrorist attacks in September. In response, the Federal Reserve reduced interest rates at every meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in 2001 and an additional three times between meetings, for a total of eleven rate cuts totaling 475 basis points. Also, by year-end, serious concerns had arisen about the integrity of corporate management and financial reporting. Credit quality deterioration was concentrated in larger corporations, with several filing for bankruptcy. Argentina's economic difficulties reminded us, yet again, that exposures to emerging economies could present substantial risk. Given these events, the U.S. banking system has remained strong possibly in large part, because the recession in this country seems to have been relatively mild and short-lived. More directly, the strength seems also to reflect improvements in risk management at many banks and a greater awareness throughout the industry that institutions should promptly address problems as they emerge. This time, both the banking industry and the regulatory agencies appear to have done just that--acted promptly--and without going too far and unnecessarily constraining credit. Much of the weakness among banks recently has been concentrated in large regional and money center banks, rather than in smaller institutions. Bank earnings, capital levels, and asset quality all remain strong by historical standards. Indeed, as the industry's problem assets began to climb in recent years, banks were generally better prepared to deal with potential threats than they were in the past. The industry entered the latest slowdown in solid financial condition, giving both the banking system and the regulatory agencies much more freedom to respond than they had a decade ago when losses were large and broadly based and bank capital positions were weak. To be sure, there were signs that risks in recent years were building, to the point that both the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued warnings about lending standards as early as 1998, a time when many of today's weak credits were booked. Financial problems in Asia later that year further sensitized large banks, in particular, to potential risks and led many to strengthen their lending standards and practices. That proverbial ""stitch in time"" may have helped greatly in preventing problems from becoming larger. Nevertheless, for each of the past two years, the annual interagency reviews of shared national credits have shown clear deterioration in bank asset quality. Both times, the reviews of credits exceeding $20 million that are shared by three or more banking organizations indicated not only that problem assets were rising quickly but also that the lead underwriters were sometimes slow to recognize the deterioration in their internal credit ratings. Both of these findings were particularly apparent to us in 2000, but promptness in recognition of deteriorating credit ratings improved notably in 2001, when the supervisory reviews produced far fewer surprises to banks. When the economy slows, one expects the volume of problem credit to rise. The key, of course, is to anticipate such slowdowns and to maintain sound credit standards at all times. As a former banker, I know that is easier said than done, given the uncertainties of credit and economic analysis and the level of competition. That's where sound risk- management processes and procedures, diversification, corporate governance, and strong capital ratios play important roles. For the most part, community banks have so far been spared from the weakness in commercial and industrial loan portfolios that has affected many larger institutions. Though all banks were affected by the soft economy last year, those with less than $1 billion in assets saw little increase in their nonperforming C&I loans, compared with a rise of 37 percent for the industry overall. As a result, community banks generally avoided pressures to increase loss provisions and still maintained reserve coverage ratios that were stronger than those of larger banks. In short, smaller banks here in Ohio and across the country have weathered recent periods quite well and are advantageously situated to do their part in supporting economic growth. If not C&I lending, what areas may present heightened risks to community banks today? First, for most of the past decade, community banks--particularly those in the asset range of $100 million to $1 billion--have actively expanded their commercial real estate lending. Since the early 1990s, larger community banks have grown commercial real estate portfolios from 13 percent to 22 percent of aggregate assets. To date, these credits have generally performed well, and my comments are not intended to suggest a material concern. These credits, however, account for most of the group's increase in nonperforming assets last year. Given the checkered history of commercial real estate lending and its increased relevance to many community banks, this portfolio must be monitored and managed carefully. We have often seen the cyclical nature of commercial real estate and its links to the general level of economic activity. The loss of anchor firms such as K-Mart, for example, may reduce the market value of certain shopping centers and the consumer traffic and the financial strength of nearby businesses as well. The second area of potential risk relates to interest rates. For the industry overall, the Federal Reserve's rate cuts last year may have proved to be a mixed blessing. Lower interest rates undoubtedly eased payment pressures on many borrowers and prevented further deterioration in the quality of bank loan portfolios. Liability-sensitive banks saw their funding costs fall faster than loan and investment yields, widening their net interest margin. Lower interest rates also spurred a record volume of mortgage refinancings and sizable gains in bank securities portfolios. However, the lower rates will begin to narrow net interest margins for some institutions. Rates paid on deposits are close to their effective floors, and yields on loan portfolios are lower because of refinancings and the falling prime rate. Many banks responded to the low rates by sharply reducing their investments in Treasuries and shifting funds into mortgage-backed securities, as they searched for higher yields. Given the historically low interest rates at which recent mortgages have been originated or refinanced, one might expect that these loans would be much slower to prepay than previous ones. As a result, the effective maturity, or duration, of bank securities portfolios--and of many loan portfolios, as well--has been extended. Clearly, I am not about to forecast interest rates, something I've already learned that central bankers never do. Nevertheless, the interest-rate environment could present banks with a greater challenge this year. In this situation, the simple concept of ""reversion to the mean"" suggests a greater awareness of the risk of rising rates and their effect on long-term assets. Even stable rates could present increased risks, if savings and money market deposit accounts deposits flow out of banks as quickly as they came in last year. We should all ask ourselves how long depositors would be content earning the currently low rates as equity markets improve or interest rates rise once again. At some point, even loyal customers-- those on fixed incomes, in particular--may blink and take steps to improve their returns. Turning to the longer-term outlook, what are the prospects for community banks? The picture is mixed. Clearly community banks have performed and continue to perform well, and they will retain an important role in our banking system. They have historically had higher profitability, as measured by the return on average assets, than large regional and money center banks and, on an individual-institution basis, have enjoyed relatively strong asset and deposit growth. A study recently published in the Federal Reserve Bulletin examined growth rates during the past fifteen years for large and small banks. Adjusting the data for mergers and acquisitions, the authors found that small and medium-sized banks--defined as those below the 100 largest--grew faster than the larger banks in virtually every year between 1985 and 2000. Moreover, the smallest banks, those below the 1,000 largest in terms of assets, grew the fastest of all in both deposits and total assets. The banks did this the old-fashioned way, by earning more on assets than larger institutions. Although small banks paid higher average deposit rates than the large banks paid, their net interest margins were still much higher, and by a growing differential in recent years. Measured by return on assets, small banks have done as well as or better than large banks in all but a handful of years over the past decade and a half. Among small banks, those located in urban areas have done best, presumably because economic activity has been expanding the fastest in cities. Asset and deposit growth at small agricultural banks, by contrast, lagged behind that at other small banks, although not at large banks. The comparatively poor performance of agricultural banks seems to reflect the level of credit demand in the agricultural sector itself, as growth of farm business debt has lagged behind that of total nonfinancial debt. Another factor has been a pickup in market share by the Farm Credit System. Even so, when measured by return on assets, small agricultural banks have performed on a par with other small banks. The surprisingly strong and persistent growth in the number of branch offices also suggests that the personal touch, which plays to the strength of community banks, remains an important element of banking in the age of the Internet. During the past fifteen years, the number of branch offices has steadily increased, rising more than 50 percent, from about 43,000 to more than 65,000 branches. The creation of de novo banks also remains strong, rising in recent years to about 200, annually, from roughly 100 new banks each year during 1993-95. Regardless of how long these trends continue, the creation of so many new banks and banking offices suggests that the market still views the opportunities and business franchise of small commercial banks to be quite sound. On the other hand, trends in market share for community banks seem to present a less optimistic picture. Adjusting the data to account for inflation and real industry growth, the community bank share of industry assets has steadily declined, falling from 25 percent a decade ago to about 16 percent now. By other measures of industry structure, the number of banks, top-tier holding companies, and independent banks all declined sharply during the past ten to fifteen years. If small banks are doing so well, what explains their steady decline in market share and number? Apparently, the industry's massive consolidation has simply allowed many owners of small banks--as well as not-so-small banks--to liquidate their investments at nice profits. For now, the future of community banks remains bright. These banks are performing well, and those that remain independent are likely to thrive in the years ahead. A crucial question, though, is how large the community-banking group will be a decade from now and how much additional industry consolidation lies ahead. Although the banks that survive may do well, the number of community banks may continue to decline significantly. For the moment, another dynamic that may be working for community banks is their relatively simple--and more readily transparent--operations. Certainly complex, off-balance- sheet transactions and the accounting standards associated with them have appropriately attracted much attention in recent months. This increased complexity has become a particular challenge for bank supervisors as well. In the current, post-Enron environment, financial institutions, their accountants, and regulators must understand each other's role and the need for adequate transparency in reporting to investors and customers. You may recall that in the wake of the thrift industry problems of the 1980s legislation required the banking agencies to apply generally accepted accounting principles in their regulatory reports, rather than special accounting rules established by depository institution regulators. At the time, the Congress saw the requirement as helpful in strengthening regulatory standards and reporting requirements. As new types of transactions have developed, and organizations of all types have become more complex, concerns have been raised about the robustness of accounting standards. For various reasons, accounting and disclosure practices have tended to obfuscate more than clarify and to conceal rather than disclose. That situation must change. One of the challenges facing management and auditors is to fairly disclose the information that is most important to investors and customers in assessing the health of any organization they deal with. This necessarily includes sufficient information to understand the key risk exposures that the organization must manage successfully. Of course, before any risk can be disclosed it must first be identified and characterized in some fashion. Increasingly, this characterization and the entire risk- management process have become more quantitative, reflecting not only the enhanced ability and lower costs of collecting and processing data but also improved techniques for measuring and managing risk. Larger banking organizations quantify a borrower's probability of default, the bank's loss given default and its likely exposure at the time of default--practices upon which we are trying to construct new international capital standards. At community banks, the greater use of credit-scoring has, it seems, improved risk management as well. Such tools should perform even better after the effects of the most recent economic slowdown are incorporated. Consumer credit models were developed after the 1990-91 recession, and so their reliability in predicting credit quality in the current slowdown is yet to be determined. Further, we are already observing increases in delinquencies in subprime lending. Since many of these borrowers did not have significant access to credit in previous recessions, their ultimate default rate will also help to validate the strength of the new statistical models. Community banks have greatly improved their management of interest rate risk in recent years. Information developed from models that are used to identify sensitivity to market changes in the mix of loans and deposits are now part of asset/liability committee meetings at community banks. As a result, managers can better anticipate changes in net interest income and respond appropriately to their unique competitive conditions. Community bankers are also developing new revenue streams that will help to manage risk by diversifying sources of earnings. In addition, the fee income streams help to increase the cross-sell ratio with key customers. This in turn should improve customer loyalty, another factor that should help manage risk by stabilizing revenue. Providing the personal touch has served community banks well, but conducting sound market research and pricing to reflect competition, customer value, and risk are becoming more important for success. As bankers and bank directors, you have specific responsibilities to manage and control your risks well. Not only are the activities of banks central to credit intermediation, in this country banks fund those activities in part with federally insured deposits. These deposits are the lowest cost source of funds for bankers because of the government's guarantee. Bankers also have obligations to investors and customers to clearly disclose the condition of their organizations and effectively oversee the system of internal controls. Bank directors are not expected to understand every nuance of banking or to oversee each transaction. They can look to management for that. They do, however, have the responsibility to set the tone regarding their institutions' risk-taking and to implement sufficient controls so that they can reasonably expect that their directives will be met. They also have the responsibility to hire individuals who they believe have integrity and can exercise a high level of judgment and competence. All the banking agencies have issued guidance describing the proper roles of bank officers and directors that address such matters as policies, procedures, information systems, and controls. For example, interagency policy holds boards of directors responsible for ensuring that their organizations have an effective audit process and internal controls that are adequate for the nature and scope of the business. The reporting lines of the internal audit function should be such that the information directors receive is impartial and not unduly influenced by management. Internal audit is a key element of management's responsibility to validate the strength of their internal controls. If internal audit is outsourced, the best practice is to not use the same firm for the external audit engagement. Indeed, the recent failure of Oakwood Deposit Bank Company, an Ohio institution, appears to underscore the importance of the audit function and sound internal controls in guarding a bank against harm. Audit committee members should have regular time in meetings to talk with the outside auditors without managers present. Best practices for audit committee processes have been laid out many times, including in the 1980s by the Treadway Commission and in 2000 by the Blue Ribbon Committee. Beyond that, boards of directors and managers should periodically test where they stand on ethical business practices. For example, ask whether we squeaked by on technicalities and on the margin, adhering perhaps to the letter but not the spirit of the ""law""? Are we compensating others and ourselves based on the value of our contributions to the organization, or are we taking advantage of opportunities and abusing our positions? My intent today is to remind everyone of the importance of maintaining sound ethical practices to help protect the reputation of your bank. As recent events have demonstrated, if we fail to do so, the market will enforce the discipline. And that discipline can be harsh and sometimes indiscriminate. Investors and customers tend to vote quickly with their feet, once confidence is lost. In closing, I commend you and the industry, generally, for the success of the 1990s and for dealing effectively with a challenging year in 2001. The industry has demonstrated that it is fundamentally sound and well positioned. Bankers should support the development of risk-management processes for those types of risk that are most relevant for their particular institution. Though the quality of bank accounting and control systems is strong, bankers should heed lessons to be learned from Enron. Strengthen corporate governance where needed to prevent such abusive practices from occurring at your institutions. As bankers and bank regulators, we are responsible for conducting our affairs with competence and integrity. Let's take the opportunity times like this present and make our banking system even stronger.

6459,r020611a_FOMC,united states,2002-06-11,"Governor Bies presented identical remarks at the South Carolina Bankers Association Annual Meeting, Palm Beach, Florida, June 14, 2002",bies,0,"Good morning. Thank you for the invitation to speak to members of the Tennessee Bankers Association today. I have really enjoyed getting to talk to many old friends. Some of you have asked if I have had any surprises in my new role as a Governor of the Federal Reserve Board. I must say the biggest surprise is the amount of reading that I do. I haven't read so much on so many different topics since I was in graduate school! Not only do I get to discuss economics and monetary policy, but also bank regulation and operations issues. Even though I have experience at a Federal Reserve Bank and at First Tennessee Bank for a total of twenty-six years, I find that wearing the hat of a central banker makes me consider issues facing the financial industry in new ways. I hope that over the years I can continue to meet with groups like yours so that I stay up to date on issues important to bankers. In my comments today, I will address: first, the financial performance of U.S. banks, in particular, of community banks; second, the improvements that banks large and small are making in measuring and managing risk; and, third, the responsibilities of directors and senior managers in corporate governance. In my view, these topics are integrally linked and, in light of current questions of confidence in America's corporations, quite timely. Fourth and finally, I would also like to mention the proposal the Federal Reserve has issued for comment on changes to the discount window. Last year was exceptional in many respects, with the United States slipping into what appears to have been a mild recession, and with the terrorist attacks in September. In response, the Federal Reserve reduced interest rates at every meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in 2001 and an additional three times between meetings, for a total of eleven rate cuts accumulating to 475 basis points. The Federal Reserve has now moved from a policy bias to address weakness, to one where the risks of inflation and weakness are balanced. Credit quality deterioration is concentrated in larger corporations, with several filing for bankruptcy. Serious concerns have arisen about the integrity of corporate management and financial reporting. Argentina's economic difficulties reminded us, yet again, that exposures to emerging economies could present substantial risk. Given these events, the U.S. banking system has remained strong, possibly in large part because the recession in this country seems to have been relatively mild and short-lived. More directly, the strength seems also to reflect improvements in risk management at many banks and a greater awareness throughout the industry that institutions should promptly address problems as they emerge. This time both the banking industry and the regulatory agencies appear to have done just that--acted promptly--and without going too far and unnecessarily constraining credit. Much of the weakness among banks recently has been concentrated in large regional and money center banks, rather than in smaller institutions. Bank earnings reached a record level in the first quarter of 2002, with one of the highest quarterly return-on-assets ratio ever reported of 1.33 percent. Net interest income was the driver of stronger revenue, despite lower commercial loan volume. Loan loss provisions were significantly above the first quarter of 2001, although below levels of the fourth quarter. Higher charge-offs were concentrated in commercial loans at large banks and in credit card specialty lenders. What areas may present heightened risks to community banks today? First, for most of the past decade, community banks--particularly those in the asset range of $100 million to $1 billion--have actively expanded their commercial real estate lending. Since the early 1990s, larger community banks have expanded their commercial real estate portfolios from 13 percent of aggregate assets to 22 percent. To date, these credits have generally performed well, and my comments are not intended to suggest a material concern. These credits, however, account for most of the group's increase in nonperforming assets over the past year. Given the checkered history of commercial real estate lending and its increased relevance to many community banks, this portfolio must be monitored and managed carefully. We have often seen the cyclical nature of commercial real estate and its links to the general level of economic activity. The loss of anchor firms such as K-Mart, for example, may reduce the market value of certain shopping centers and the consumer traffic and the financial strength of nearby businesses as well. The second area of potential risk relates to interest rates. For the industry overall, the Federal Reserve's rate cuts last year may have proved to be a mixed blessing. Lower interest rates undoubtedly eased payment pressures on many borrowers and prevented further deterioration in the quality of bank loan portfolios. Liability-sensitive banks saw their funding costs fall faster than loan and investment yields, and more than half of all banks had a wider net interest margin in the first quarter of 2002 than in 2001. However, lower interest rates will begin to narrow net interest margins for some institutions. Rates paid on deposits are close to their effective floors, and yields on loan portfolios are lower because of a record volume of refinancings and the falling prime rate. Many banks responded to the low rates by sharply reducing their investments in Treasuries and shifting funds into mortgage-backed securities, as they searched for higher yields. Given the historically low interest rates at which recent mortgages have been originated or refinanced one might expect that these loans would be much slower to prepay than previous ones. As a result, the effective maturity, or duration, of bank securities portfolios--and of many loan portfolios, as well--has been extended. Clearly, I am not about to forecast interest rates, something I've already learned that central bankers never do. Nevertheless, the interest-rate environment could present banks with a greater challenge later this year. Even stable rates could present increased risks, if savings and money market deposit account deposits flow out of banks as quickly as they came in last year. We should all ask ourselves how long depositors would be content earning the currently low rates as equity markets improve or interest rates rise once again. At some point, even loyal customers--those on fixed incomes, in particular--may blink and take steps to improve their returns. Turning to the longer-term outlook, what are the prospects for community banks? They have historically had higher profitability, as measured by the return on average assets, than large regional and money center banks and, on an individual-institution basis, have enjoyed relatively strong asset and deposit growth. A study recently published in the examined growth rates during the past fifteen years for large and small banks. Adjusting the data for mergers and acquisitions, the authors found that small and medium-sized banks--defined as those below the 100 largest--grew faster than the larger banks in virtually every year between 1985 and 2000. Moreover, the smallest banks, those below the 1,000 largest in terms of assets, grew the fastest of all in both deposits and total assets. The banks did this the old-fashioned way, by earning more on assets than larger institutions. Although small banks have paid higher average deposit rates than the large banks have paid, their net interest margins were still much higher, and by a growing differential in recent years. Measured by return on assets, small banks have done as well as or better than large banks in all but a handful of years over the past decade and a half. The health of financial institutions today also reflects the improvement in risk management process that has been ongoing at banks for years. Increasingly, the entire risk management process has become more quantitative, reflecting not only the enhanced ability and lower costs of collecting and processing data but also improved techniques for measuring and managing risk. Larger banking organizations quantify a borrower's probability of default, the bank's loss given default and its likely exposure at the time of default--practices upon which we are trying to construct new international capital standards. The greater use of credit scoring has, it seems, improved risk management as well. Such tools should perform even better after the effects of the most recent economic slowdown are incorporated. Consumer credit models were developed after the 1990-91 recession, and so their reliability in predicting credit quality in the current slowdown is yet to be determined. Further, we are already observing increases in delinquencies in subprime lending. Since many of these borrowers did not have significant access to credit in previous recessions, their ultimate default rate will also help to validate the strength of the new statistical models. Community banks have greatly improved their management of interest rate risk in recent years. Information developed from models that are used to identify sensitivity to market changes in the mix of loans and deposits are now part of asset/liability committee meetings at community banks. As a result, managers can better anticipate changes in net interest income and respond appropriately to their unique competitive conditions. Community bankers are also developing new revenue streams that will help to manage risk by diversifying sources of earnings. In addition, the fee income streams help to increase the cross-sell ratio with key customers. This in turn should improve customer loyalty, another factor that should help manage risk by stabilizing revenue. Providing the personal touch has served community banks well, but conducting sound market research and pricing to reflect competition, customer value, and risk are becoming more important for success. The Arthur Andersen matters and other corporate events currently being addressed provide good risk management lessons for bankers as they try to increase earnings by cross selling more products. When line officers are compensated on sales and cross selling, a strong, independent quality assurance or risk review function becomes even more essential. For public accounting firms, strong quality assurance functions are needed to protect the core business integrity of attestation services when the firm is trying to win consulting contracts. In banks, where credit is still the dominant risk exposure, the chief credit officer should make sure unacceptable credit risks are not taken to win fee income business whose net revenue may not cover credit exposures. Another critical element of risk management is effective corporate governance. As bankers and bank directors, you have specific responsibilities to manage the risks at your financial institution and effectively oversee the system of internal controls. Not only are the activities of banks central to credit intermediation, in this country banks fund those activities in part with federally insured deposits. These deposits are the lowest cost source of funds for bankers because of the government's guarantee. Bank directors are not expected to understand every nuance of banking or to oversee each transaction. They can look to management for that. They do, however, have the responsibility to set the tone regarding their institutions' risk taking and to oversee the internal control processes so that they can reasonably expect that their directives will be followed. They also have the responsibility to hire individuals who they believe have integrity and can exercise a high level of judgment and competence. Interagency policy holds boards of directors responsible for ensuring that their organizations have an effective audit process and internal controls that are adequate for the nature and scope of their businesses. The reporting lines of the internal audit function should be such that the information directors receive is impartial and not unduly influenced by management. Internal audit is a key element of management's responsibility to validate the strength of their internal controls. If internal audit is outsourced, best practice is to not use the same firm for the external audit engagement. Internal controls are the responsibility of line management. Line managers must determine the level of risks they need to accept to run their businesses, and assure themselves that the combination of earnings, capital and internal controls is sufficient to compensate for the risk exposures. Staff areas such as accounting, internal audit, risk management, credit review, compliance, and legal, independently monitor the control processes to ensure that they are effective and that risks are measured appropriately. The results of these independent reviews should be routinely reported to executive management and the board of directors. Both executive management and the board should be engaged enough in the process to determine if these reviews are in fact independent of the operating areas they are designed to review, and that the senior officers in those roles can speak freely on issues that need to be addressed. Audit committee members should have regular time in meetings to talk with the outside auditors without managers present. Best practices for audit committee processes have been laid out many times, including in the 1980s by the Treadway Commission and in 2000 by the Blue Ribbon Committee. Beyond that, boards of directors and managers should periodically test where they stand on ethical business practices. For example, they should ask, ""Are we getting by on technicalities, adhering to the letter but not the spirit of the law? Are we compensating others and ourselves based on our contributions to the organization, or are we taking advantage of our positions?"" My intent today is to remind everyone of the importance of maintaining sound ethical practices to help protect the reputation of your bank. As recent events have demonstrated, if we fail to do so the market will enforce the discipline. And that discipline can be harsh. The current framework of financial reporting in the United States effectively represents the performance of most corporations most of the time. Indeed the high quality of accounting standards in this country is one critical reason why capital markets are so efficient. But the lessons of the past few months remind us that accounting rules can be bent. For six years I was a member of the Emerging Issues Task Force of the Financial Accounting Standards Board. This is the rulemaking body that deals with divergence in practice. The EITF's role is to provide timely financial reporting guidance where divergence in practice is developing. In the time I served on the EITF I came to understand that professionals could and did disagree on the best accounting standard to apply to a new type of transaction. That is at the very heart of the struggle to keep accounting standards current. The rapid pace of business innovations makes it impractical to have a rule in place to anticipate every business transaction. Rather, the more complex and dynamic the world of business becomes, the more important it is that accounting be based on strong principles that are sufficiently robust to provide the framework for proper accounting of new types of transactions. Further, we need to insist on higher professional standards and not permit financial officers and auditors to benefit from ""gaming"" the rules-based accounting standards that are increasing in complexity, particularly in the United States. The core of these basic accounting principles should be professional standards followed by every corporate accountant and every outside auditor that would insist that they can answer ""yes"" to these questions: ""Does the accounting method selected faithfully represent the economics of the transaction? Does the disclosure provide the user of financial reports with sufficient information to discern the nature of the significant transactions and risks of the organization?"" But rules alone do not guarantee good financial reporting. For Enron and other recent examples, weak corporate governance practices apparently permitted sham transactions and misleading financial reporting to occur. Outside auditors erred in trying too much to please a paying client. They forgot that their professional role is to provide assurance to users of financial reports that the quality of financial reporting meets the expectations of the marketplace. Some observers have asserted that new accounting standards are needed. I do not know the specifics of many of the irregularities that have recently come to light. But judging from the publicly available information, I believe that what we need most is to restore the integrity of corporate accountants and the quality of the audit process rather than extensive new accounting standards. One reason that accounting in the United States has become so rule-based is that we tend to add new accounting standards when abuses occur even when the abuses resulted from accounting and audit failures. Discipline against auditors should occur when accounting standards have been manipulated. The present industry-driven process clearly has not worked and a new oversight process is needed to ensure audit quality. Given human nature, we must expect that rules will sometime be broken. But we can expect oversight boards to enforce penalties appropriate to the situation that will discourage others from breaking the rules in the future. Corporate boards and accounting officers need to shoulder their responsibilities too. The surprises that typically occur at banks are due to the nature of risk exposures and the quality of risk management practices. In addition to applying sound accounting treatments, managers must ensure that public disclosures clearly identify all significant risk exposures--whether on or off the balance sheet--and their effect on the firm's financial condition and performance. I particularly want to emphasize that disclosure need not be in a standard accounting framework or exactly the same for all--otherwise we would be certain to create statistical artifacts and implications of safe harbors. Rather, we should insist that each entity disclose what it believes its stakeholders need to evaluate its risk profile. The uniqueness of risks and business lines in complex organizations means that disclosures--to be effective--should be different for each bank. That is the approach being taken in developing the Basel II Capital Accord. Disclosure rules that are built too rigidly while risk management processes continue to evolve may make them less effective in describing the risk profile of a specific organization. But if bankers do not voluntarily improve disclosures, rules will be written. As you probably know, the Board of Governors recently requested public comment on a proposal to revise the Federal Reserve's discount window programs. Before I get into details, I'd like to emphasize that implementation of the proposal would not entail a change in the stance of monetary policy. There is nothing in the proposal that would necessitate a change in the target for the federal funds rate or the level of interest rates more generally. The Board is proposing the establishment of a new type of discount window credit, to be called primary credit, which would replace adjustment credit, currently the Federal Reserve's main lending program. Primary credit would be available for very short terms as a backup source of liquidity to depository institutions that are in generally sound financial condition. There would be no prohibition on lending the proceeds of a primary credit loan to other depository institutions. Unlike adjustment credit, which currently is extended at a below-market rate, primary credit would be extended at a rate that would be above the usual level of short-term market interest rates, including the federal funds rate. By restricting eligibility to generally sound institutions and by eliminating the incentive for institutions to borrow to exploit the below-market discount rate, the primary credit program should considerably reduce the need for Federal Reserve discount officers to review the funding situations of borrowers. And since only sound institutions will be using primary credit, banks should be less concerned that their use of the window would signal incorrectly that they were experiencing significant funding difficulties. As a result, the Federal Reserve expects that institutions will be more willing to use the window. This increased willingness, and the ability of institutions to resell the proceeds of discount window loans, should improve the functioning of the window as a safety valve for the reserve market and for individual institutions. The interest rate for primary credit would be set through a procedure identical to that currently used for the basic discount rate. That is, the boards of directors at Reserve Banks would set the rate, subject to review and determination by the Board of Governors. In the proposal, it is envisioned that the interest rate on primary credit would initially be set 100 basis points above the target federal funds rate. If adopted, this program would align our lending practices to those of other major central banks. The Board also is requesting comment on the seasonal credit program. The seasonal credit program was established in 1973 to address the difficulties that relatively small banks with substantial intra-yearly swings in funding needs faced because of a lack of access to the national money markets. However, funding opportunities for smaller depository institutions have expanded significantly over the past few decades as a result of deposit deregulation and the general development of financial markets, calling into question the continued need for the seasonal program. The Board is seeking specific comment on whether small depository institutions still lack reasonable access to funding markets and on the continued need for the seasonal lending program. The Board would also like comment on the method for setting the seasonal credit discount rate, which is currently the average of the federal funds rate and a certificate of deposit rate, well below the proposed primary credit rate. We would value your comments on all aspects of the proposal. The ninety-day comment period ends August 22. Information on where to address the comments, and more information on the proposed revision, can be found on the Board of Governors' website. In closing, I commend you and the industry, generally, for successfully dealing with the challenges of 2001. The industry has demonstrated that it is fundamentally sound and well positioned. Bankers should support the development of risk management processes for those types of risk that are most relevant for their particular institution. Sound accounting, auditing, and disclosure, consistently applied, have long been at the heart of efficient markets. Though the quality of bank accounting and control systems is strong, bankers should heed lessons to be learned from Enron and other breakdowns in accounting and audit processes. Strengthen corporate governance where needed to prevent such abusive practices from occurring at your institutions. As bankers and bank regulators, we are responsible for conducting our affairs with competence and integrity.

As Allan notes (in his preface), this project has been nearly thirty years in the making. I understand that the first draft of his analysis of the failure of monetary policy during the 1930s (chapter 5) dates back to 1966. After what has surely been the most exhaustive examination to date of records of policy discussions at the Board of Governors and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Allan has provided what is, by far, the most detailed analysis of Federal Reserve policy through the Federal Reserve-Treasury Accord of 1951. The outcome is certain to be recognized as an indispensable input for monetary economists and economic historians alike. Volume I takes us through the evolution of the Federal Reserve as an institution, from its birth as a decentralized, partly private institution with diffuse power to its later development into a central bank with semi-autonomous banks that became part of a unified system. The exposition highlights the importance of structuring a system with appropriate incentives and safeguards as a precondition for sound policymaking. But it also focuses on elements that the Federal Reserve System's founders perhaps could not have anticipated, including the early internal power struggles and the profoundly challenging economic and political events, which contributed to policy errors. Over the years we have become more knowledgeable about how the economic environment evolves. But to our predecessors, much was virgin policy territory. It is no wonder that many of their initiatives went astray. Allan successfully weaves into the story the interaction of economic ideas with events and policy decisions and highlights how the prevalence of misperceptions and incorrect beliefs, perhaps induced by academic theories of the day, contributed to policy errors. One may not always agree with the conclusions regarding specific episodes or their interpretation, but any disagreement would not take away from one's appreciation of the perceptive description of the underlying events, debates and policy actions. History teaches us that no matter how well intentioned economic policies and decisions may be, policymakers never can possess enough knowledge of the complexities of the economy nor sufficiently foresee changes in the economic environment to avoid error. But history can and does provide examples that can help guide policymakers away from repeating the worst mistakes of the past. Indeed, only through an understanding of historical precedents can we continue to improve our policies. In this regard, one cannot be overly appreciative of Allan's contributions in this and his other important works over the years. I would like to end my remarks on this monumental thirty-year effort with but one request. Could we put volume II on a track that's a tad faster?

6506,r030313a_FOMC,united states,2003-03-13,NO_INFO,olson,0,"The year that just ended was one of record profits for the industry as a whole, and for community banks in particular. Community banks-- that is, those with assets of less than $1 billion--earned $12.5 billion, or 11.7 percent, on equity, an increase of 80 basis points over 2001. This past year was one in which commercial loan demand was very weak, and some of our largest banks stumbled. Community banks were able to adapt successfully to these conditions and made significant changes, in particular to their balance sheets. Low interest rates, strong home values and weak equity markets all had important roles to play. Total assets of community banks grew 3.7 percent, about the same as 2001, after several years of declines or minor increases. Nearly all of this year's loan growth came in lending secured by real estate. Construction and other commercial real estate lending represented about two-thirds of that growth and rose more than 10 percent during the year. Loans drawn under home equity lines of credit grew nearly 25 percent. Outside of the loan portfolio, real estate was an important story as well. Holdings of residential mortgage pass-through securities grew 20 percent in 2002, part of an interesting reversal in community bank balance sheet trends. Securities holdings increased in 2002 after eight consecutive years of decline, while total loans have declined only once over the same period (in 1998). Over the past two years, community bank holdings of mortgage pass-through securities have risen some 50 percent. By and large, lending that is not secured in some fashion by real estate declined last year. Consumer loans declined nearly 9 percent, a bit faster than in 2001, while commercial and industrial loans were off very slightly. Net interest margins rose slightly, to 4.29 percent, but remain about 25 basis points below levels that prevailed in the first half of the 1990s. Partly as a result of low interest rates and uncertainty in the stock market, Money Market Deposit Account (MMDA) and savings deposits grew 10 percent in both 2001 and 2002 and, at this point, fund nearly 25 percent of community bank assets. For the first time on record, these balances exceeded the volume of small-denomination certificates of deposit (that is, those under $100,000), although some of the CD balances may have been transferred to money market or savings accounts. Noninterest income overall remained at about 1.4 percent of assets, although up slightly (about 4 basis points) from 2001. Deposit growth overall also brought higher deposit account fees. Mortgage origination revenues were aided by the refinancing boom, although their beneficial effects were moderated by write-downs of servicing rights at those institutions with mortgage-servicing portfolios. Income from fiduciary activities--trust fees--also declined, attributable in large part to weakness in equity markets. Problem credits remain elevated but, on the whole, manageable. Nonperforming assets continued to rise moderately, reaching 0.95 percent of loans at year's end. While significant, this figure is less than half the 2.46 percent ratio seen in 1992. Loan losses amounted to 40 basis points of loans, about the same as 2001. Provisions once again exceeded charge-offs, at 0.57 percent of loans, allowing loan-loss reserves to remain at about 1.45 percent of loans and about 2.0 times nonaccrual loans. Although total assets rose during the year, 2002 also brought further consolidation in the number of community banks. At year's end, there were just under 7,500 community banks, down 200 from 2001 and some 3,600 from ten years earlier. There are indications that some mergers took place within banking groups with multiple bank subsidiaries in the wake of the Riegle-Neal Act as a step toward improved operating efficiency. Vitality of the community bank franchise As the financial results suggest, the community banking franchise remains vital and vibrant. It's worth talking about that for a minute. Consolidation is not the right or only measure of value in a community bank franchise. This value is better measured in economic terms, that is, by the flows of start-up capital and long-term financial returns on capital invested. Over the past five years, for every three bank charters that have disappeared through consolidation, one new charter has been approved. These new charters require very tangible investment of investor capital. Since January 2000, some $2 billion to $2.5 billion has been invested in new bank charters. As an important aside to the number of new banks, for some time 75 percent of all new charters issued have been state bank charters. In 2002, the ratio was still high, although closer to two-thirds. The dual banking system, which is such an important part of our financial heritage, continues to function well. Our nation's state banking commissioners can claim much of the credit for this result, having facilitated banks' interest in branching across state lines by developing home/host state bank supervision accords. This influx of start-up capital reflects the longer-term financial success of community banking as a business model. Over time, return on equity for the bulk of community banks has been consistently high: Returns for the top 60 percent of community banks have exceeded 11 percent to 12 percent annually. As noted earlier, aggregate assets have been on the rise since 1998, and are now 5 percent higher than in 1992 even though there are significantly fewer institutions. Strategic sources of this vitality The basic business story behind this vitality is familiar. It is keyed to community banks' ability to attract deposits, draw upon natural lending opportunities, and leverage their connections with the community. Community banks continue to thrive by providing retail-banking customers with the convenient locations, high-quality service, and attractive prices that they desire. Surveys conducted by the Federal Reserve Board indicate that the single most important factor influencing a customer's choice of banks is the location of the institution's branches. In the 2001 Survey of Consumer Finances, approximately 43 percent of households report that the primary reason for choosing the institution where they have their main checking account is the location of the institution's offices. Likewise, data collected in the 1998 Survey of Small Business Finances indicate that, for approximately 30 percent of small businesses in the United States, the most important reason for selecting their primary financial institution is ""location of offices"" or ""convenience."" Consistent with these findings, responses to questions included in the Michigan Surveys of Consumers in June, July and August 1999 indicate that the most important reason households change banks is a household relocation. Other important factors underlying household choice of banks include low fees or minimum balance requirements and the ability to obtain many services at one place. For small businesses, the existence of a prior business or personal relationship with the institution or someone affiliated with the institution is a frequently cited reason for choosing a particular provider. Once a household has chosen a particular depository institution as the location for its main checking account, there is a strong tendency to stick with that institution. According to the Michigan Survey, the median tenure at a depository institution is ten years. The most frequently reported reasons for remaining with a bank are customer service and location. Among those households that changed banks for reasons other than household relocation, the most frequently cited factors are better customer service and more attractive prices. These patterns of behavior among households and small businesses bode well for the future of community banking. They do not suggest that community banks face any inherent disadvantage relative to larger institutions when it comes to attracting and retaining retail customers. Common sense, as well as the data, suggests that there isn't a single blueprint for a successful community bank. One idea that is commonly cited is that community banks are at a disadvantage in terms of operating efficiency and the ability to generate fee income. Let's look first at operating efficiency and then define some terms. One measure of efficiency commonly used in the industry is the efficiency ratio, which compares the level of non-interest expense needed to support one dollar of operating revenue. A lower ratio thus indicates a more efficient bank. In comparing these efficiency ratios for all insured commercial banks in the United States between 1997 and 2001, some interesting results emerge. One way of comparing these ratios across size categories is to look at the median bank in each category--that is, if you lined up all the banks in a size grouping from highest to lowest in terms of their efficiency ratios, the one that ends up in the middle of the list is the median. For our purposes, we can treat the middle bank as the typical bank in that group. The median efficiency ratio for larger banks--that is, those with more than $5 billion in assets--ranged between 57 percent and 62 percent between 1997 and 2001. The median ratio for community banks indeed comes out higher, at between 60 percent and 67 percent. In other words, by this measure, a typical community bank needs to spend 3 to 5 cents more than its large-bank counterpart to generate one dollar of operating revenue. That difference is material, but not overwhelming. But that median is not the whole story. There is a wide range of efficiency ratios across the population of community banks, and many community banks are indeed not at a disadvantage at all. As a general proposition, some 40 percent of community banks have efficiency ratios that match or fall below that of the typical large bank. The top 10 percent of community banks are extremely efficient, with efficiency ratios generally well below 50 percent, and the best one-third of community banks are well below 60 percent. All of this suggests that many community banks are as efficient as a typical large bank, and that any efficiency advantage that large banks may have over others may not be that large. Efficiency measures like this do not take account of other key elements of a business strategy, including service quality and the level of customer attention, which have proved to be key advantages for community bankers. Efficiency measures across the industry improved significantly in the year just ended, because of a change in accounting practice that ended amortization of goodwill. Interestingly, efficiency ratios did not improve nearly as much for community banks as they did for large banks. One also hears the claim that large banks are better able to generate fee income than community banks and that this ability puts smaller banks at a competitive disadvantage. There is some evidence that bolstering fee income is related to profitability. The top 20 percent of community banks in terms of profitability generate nearly 40 percent of their revenues from fee income, twice the level of other community banks. Nonetheless, based on the profitability figures cited earlier, it is not at all clear that a community bank needs to dramatically build noninterest revenue to be quite successful. Fee income at the remaining 80 percent of community banks consistently represents about one-fifth of total revenue within all but the top profitability stratum, and that includes a very large number of quite profitable institutions. Protecting the community banking franchise A healthy business franchise does not guarantee financial success, nor does it ensure a safe and sound banking system. From either perspective, it is important that community bankers continue to protect the value of their franchise by avoiding key missteps we have seen in the past. Let me offer you a bit of a bank supervisor's perspective in that regard. With market yields at long-term lows and with a relatively steep yield curve, community banks need to keep a watchful eye on interest rate risk issues. Long-term residential mortgage lending comes immediately to mind. I noted earlier the remarkable recent growth in community bank holdings of mortgage pass-through securities. Direct one- to four-family and indirect holdings of one- to four-family mortgage loans as a share of the community bank balance sheet has remained fairly stable for a decade at around 20 percent of assets, but there is evidence that some institutions have sought to extend maturities to take advantage of the steep yield curve. Those institutions active in mortgage servicing have found their servicing rights have lost significant value with the surge in refinancings. Most of the loan growth at community banks over the past two years has been in the form of commercial real estate lending--that is, lending secured by nonfarm nonresidential properties, construction projects, and multifamily units. Commercial real estate lending at year-end 2002 reached almost 22 percent of aggregate community bank assets. That's 6 percent higher than five years ago and the highest degree of concentration on record--yes, even higher than in the early 1990s. This increase appears to be fairly widespread across the population of community banks, both at highly profitable and at less-profitable institutions. There are anecdotal indications that some portion of that growth may reflect conversion of unsecured C&I loans to secured loans in response to deterioration in the borrowers' condition, although it is not likely that this effect is very large. Commercial real estate lending is a normal and natural part of the community banking business, and underwriting practices are much better than in the 1980s. For both reasons, there is no indication at this time that the overall credit quality of community bank commercial real estate exposures has deteriorated. That said, there are a number of markets nationwide that have experienced weakness in recent years, and many of these markets will take some time to recover. Management and supervisors will need to monitor further developments in this area closely. More generally, a critical ""franchise"" issue for community bankers has been recognizing and managing credit risk concentrations that also tend to be a natural part of the community banking business. When credit quality problems emerge at an institution, they of course bring lower returns and more attention from your friendly bank supervisors. The presence of lending concentrations means that such problems can develop both more quickly and more broadly across a pool of borrowers. Successful management of concentrations requires adherence to good credit fundamentals. There have been important advances in the measurement and management of credit risk that community bankers should probably take a good look at in the coming years. There are no magic bullets here, of course, but community bankers may find that these advances provide useful tools and concepts that reinforce systematic and objective risk assessment in the credit management process. Strong capital ratios, well in excess of regulatory minimums, have also been a key to managing credit concentrations and, indeed, a striking attribute of the most profitable community banks. The top one-fifth of community banks, in terms of profitability, typically holds 1.6 percentage points more capital relative to assets than other community banks. With the growth in assets and lending opportunities come potential complications with liquidity management. Assets have grown more rapidly than lower-cost nonmaturity deposits over time among community banks and across the industry, a trend that was only modestly reversed in 2002 by the balloon in MMDA and savings deposits. Among other factors, this trend has contributed to narrowing margins over the past few years. The relative stability of these nonmaturity deposits has been an important strength to community banks. Conversely, there have been too many instances where rapidly growing banks face unexpected liquidity pressures as they come to rely more heavily on noncore funding sources. Careful planning of growth and funding needs is a key aspect of sound management and requires the appropriate degree of management attention. Let me also make a brief cautionary note about the importance of good internal controls and the need for management attention to their upkeep. This is simply good business practice, of course, but it's more than that. You may recall that a provision of the FDIC Improvement Act of 1991 required that the management of banks--including many community banks--report on the quality and integrity of internal controls and that auditors attest to this. Unfortunately, in several recent examinations, bank examiners were able to identify clear internal control weaknesses that neither the banks' own processes nor outside auditors had noted. Some of these weaknesses raised safety and soundness concerns. Much more progress needs to be made in this area, and we will be following this matter closely in the coming months. Community banking has a long history of strength and success and a bright future. The past year was a good one for community banks. Once again the vitality and adaptability of the community banking franchise were amply demonstrated. It is important that community bankers stay closely attuned to current and emerging risk issues, and that they explore further advances in risk-management practice in ways that are consistent with their basic business practices and the core strengths of their franchise.

6509,r030328a_FOMC,united states,2003-03-28,Community  economic development,greenspan,1,"Community economic development It is a pleasure to join this group of dedicated researchers, bankers, community leaders, and policymakers interested in the worthwhile and challenging process of program assessment. Meaningful program review can be achieved only through measurement and critical analysis. Systematic research of community economic development programs has been limited. Accordingly, your challenge is to vastly expand the information base. The overarching objective of community economic development and empowerment is to help underserved populations accumulate assets and improve their economic well-being. Measuring the results of programs dedicated to such goals is essential to maximizing the impact of these programs and managing scarce resources. Meeting the goals, particularly in areas and among populations where biases and negative perceptions may have contributed to market failures, helps people improve their financial standing, regardless of their current economic status. For nearly four decades, numerous policies and programs have been implemented with the intent of increasing economic opportunity. They have used a variety of management and funding strategies, ranging from federal government appropriations to debt and equity financing from private sources. Nevertheless, despite the broad spectrum of programs, the length of time they have been in place, and the array of funding participants, empirical research quantifying their impact is rare, regardless of whether government agencies, nonprofit organizations, or private entities sponsor the programs. The lack of measurement is particularly regrettable for government-sponsored programs, because quantifying their impact is crucial to the legislative process. When a bill is proposed in Congress, the nature of the problem and the factors presumed to be contributing to that problem typically are explicitly stated. And generally there is a projection of the outcomes that would indicate success. This process of problem diagnosis, program justification, and projection of results, if fully embraced, provides a cost-benefit structure for assessing a program's value. The program can be judged worthwhile when the data demonstrate that the benefits exceed the costs, including the opportunity costs of any investment. Even with such a framework, conducting research on community development and economic empowerment programs can be challenging, in part because the effects these programs intend to achieve are often quite difficult to measure and may not become apparent for relatively long periods of time. Initiatives aimed at complex economic and social challenges that were decades in the making require, more than likely, many years to achieve their goals. Unlike the standards for macroeconomic performance, virtually no specifically defined standards exist for monitoring the value of social and economic improvement programs. For community development researchers, the challenge is to develop parameters that can be used to objectively assess the value of their programs. For example, the measures that affordable housing organizations use could illustrate the extent to which their programs have, or have not, increased homeownership rates and property values, reduced crime, improved school performance, or spurred new private-sector investment in a disadvantaged neighborhood. Effective research must isolate the variables that best convey the impact of a program, define the specific data that must be collected, and develop a system for maintaining and retrieving the data over time. In other words, the challenge is to quantify the marginal effect of a program. The value of such a system is clear. So too, however, is the complexity of creating it. Consider, for example, the difficulty of measuring the marginal impact of a financial education program. It requires unique data collection techniques and unconventional tracking systems to gauge the benefit to an individual derived from making informed financial decisions that resulted from that educational program. The relative paucity of data and research on community development programs has limited the ability to fully demonstrate their impact and credibly differentiate those that are successful from those that are ineffective. Undeniably, impressive local community development initiatives have been undertaken, and individual testimonials reveal advances in the economic well-being of many of the beneficiaries. However, the absence of formal data collection and research for the numerous neighborhood revitalization efforts over the past several decades has resulted in a reliance on mostly anecdotal reporting at a neighborhood or individual level. Anecdotal information is not without value. It offers clues to the construction of a more formal statistical analysis. But, as I am sure all of you have experienced, anecdotes can be selective and can convey a false message of the success or failure of a community development program. Given the lack of data demonstrating outcomes from new initiatives, the inclination is to examine existing data to identify trends in areas where community development organizations have been a consistent presence for some time. One hopes that broad positive trends that cannot be understood fully from conventional market forces will suggest the possibility of community development being at least a partial explanation of these trends. Since most community development initiatives focus on urban areas, data on socioeconomic trends in central cities may offer some insight into the influence of local economic and social programs. For example, Census statistics compiled for the State of the Cities database of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) show that increases in the rates of change in homeownership in central cities slightly exceeded the increases in suburban communities between 1970 and 2000. The Federal Reserve Board's 2001 Survey of Consumer Finances concluded that between 1998 and 2001, families in the lowest quintile of the income distribution increased their rate of homeownership nearly 5 percent, saw their median income grow more than 14 percent, and realized a 25 percent gain in their median net worth. Although these gains in homeownership rates in central cities and the economic progress of lower-income families are encouraging, other data covering a longer time frame are less sanguine. In particular, HUD's State of the Cities database indicates that residents in central cities barely increased their real median family income between 1969 and 1999, while families in suburban communities did appreciably better. In addition, the poverty rate in central cities, according to this database, increased 23 percent during this thirty-year period, while it decreased 7 percent in suburban areas. These seemingly contradictory data undermine efforts to plan an appropriate course of action. The absence of credible data clearly renders researchers unable to attribute the gains to a particular program or the continued challenges to a particular failure. In weighing the implications of recent trends in data, it is important to factor in the presence of changes in external market influences. For example, advances in mortgage underwriting and delivery systems have resulted in increased availability of funding for homeownership. Community development investors' funding strategies have also changed considerably over this thirty-year span. At the Federal Reserve, economists strive to identify the appropriate variables for assessing the impact of regulations, in particular the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). In addition to the research presented at this conference, Federal Reserve economists have undertaken studies to assess whether the CRA causes banks to provide a mortgage subsidy and to determine the performance and profitability of CRA-eligible loans. But the lack of broad data management systems to identify and track the performance and profitability of most CRA-eligible loans presents researchers with a challenge, as does the need to focus on changes that can truly be attributed to the CRA, rather than to changing market forces. While empirical research on specific community development programs is limited, insights nonetheless have been gained from experience over the past several decades. Many community development corporations (CDCs) have modified their strategies and their structures accordingly. Most notably, CDCs have realized the necessity of diversifying their funding sources and reducing their reliance on government funding, which is vulnerable to the vagaries of shifting political priorities. In seeking to ensure continued financial support for their programs, community development leaders have expanded their range of financing and, in the process, have gained a better understanding of the risk tolerance and return requirements of their various capital providers. In addition to diversifying funding sources, community developers have also sought to broaden their financing strategies. They once viewed debt as the primary, if not the sole, vehicle available for capitalizing community development efforts, but now recognize the vital role of equity investment in helping communities withstand economic downturns. New sources of equity--community development venture capital funds and secondary markets that securitize community development loan pools--have become available to energize market forces in economically distressed neighborhoods. Advances in technology have significantly improved the identification and development of new financing strategies. With increased information-processing capacity, loan portfolio managers can better assess risk and monitor credit performance. Additionally, the ever-increasing availability of data facilitates the development of neighborhood profiles that can be useful in understanding and tracking community socioeconomic trends. For example, the cross-referencing of data sets on mortgage lending patterns, business start-ups, and employment figures against crime statistics and property values can provide a valuable perspective. Many valuable lessons have been learned in community development over the years. And the dissemination and application of such lessons as they emerge are essential to improving program effectiveness. Formal research can accelerate the rate of such learning. Only through a comprehensive understanding of the outcomes of a program can success be emulated and failures reduced. By consistently and reliably measuring outcomes, and thus helping current and prospective investors better assess their risks and predict their returns, community development organizations can attract more funding. Such accountability is crucial for any organization, regardless of its size. In addition to increasing funding options, research can also increase the scope and scale of programs. As effective strategies are identified, they can be replicated and incorporated into efforts in other communities, as well as by organizations seeking to develop programs to address related issues. As I noted earlier, it is important to establish formal procedures for program assessment. At the start of a program, the nature of the problem should be identified, as well as the presumptions of the various causes of that problem. With a clearer understanding of the issues, policymakers and community leaders are better able to devise a strategy for overcoming the problem. Finally, a well-constructed program must include a projection of its benefits to serve as a benchmark for later evaluation. In conclusion, I want to emphasize the importance of the role of the interpreter of the research. Analysts must be scrupulously honest in characterizing research results, or their work becomes advocacy and is no longer research. This objectivity is paramount because research findings from previous efforts become the basis for subsequently targeting scarce resources to their highest and best use. Such objectivity requires great discipline and integrity on the part of the researcher; it requires that researchers resist any innate desire to characterize results in the most, or least, favorable light possible. An understanding of the findings, positive or negative, is the greatest contribution of research. The failure of a program is not a research failure; it is a source of information. And acknowledgement of unadulterated research findings, regardless of how disappointing, contributes to a foundation of knowledge upon which future successes can be built. I often say at the end of a day that I learned a great deal. Unfortunately, most of what I learned was that what I thought I knew at the beginning of the day was false. In the quest to do good for our society's most vulnerable populations and communities--the objective compelling the work of this group--we must embrace the challenge to develop objective and quantifiable standards to assess community development programs. Ultimately, such research is the only means for determining whether we are making advances in overcoming failures in distressed neighborhoods and improving access to economic opportunities for traditionally underserved populations. I applaud your efforts and look forward to learning of your future progress.

6525,r030531a_FOMC,united states,2003-05-31,NO_INFO,bernanke,1,"I am delighted to address this meeting of the Japan Society of Monetary Economics. I would particularly like to thank Professor Shimizu both for inviting me and for helping to arrange a series of meetings with officials at the Bank of Japan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Financial Services Agency. Those meetings have given me a first-hand look at the difficult challenges that the current economic situation poses for Japan's leaders and for the Japanese people. The economic situation here is indeed enormously complex. It involves not only structural, monetary, and fiscal problems but also underlying political and social forces, which have at times limited the flexibility of policy. The sometimes frustratingly slow pace of change in Japan is all the more reason, however, for this nation's economists to speak out and present clear, persuasive arguments that will help guide the policy debate and urge leaders to effective action. At stake is not only the economic health of your country but also, to a significant degree, the prosperity of the rest of the world. From my side of the ocean, it seems that many people are looking to the United States to take the responsibility for leading the world into economic recovery. Clearly, however, faster growth in Japan and other major industrial countries would support a stronger, more balanced, and more durable recovery than one driven by U.S. growth alone. Although changes in macroeconomic policy in Japan during the past decade have generally been slow and deliberate, there has also been some willingness to experiment, not least by the Bank of Japan (BOJ). For this reason, the recent appointment of a new leadership team at the BOJ has stimulated considerable interest and expectation around the world. Although Governor Fukui and his colleagues have so far not made radical breaks with previous BOJ policies, there is reason to hope that they will be open to fresh ideas and approaches. In that spirit, my remarks today will be focused on opportunities for monetary policy innovation in Japan, including specifically the possibility of more-active monetary-fiscal cooperation to end deflation. In focusing primarily on macroeconomic policies and the deflation problem, however, I do not wish to imply that more microeconomic measures--such as bank restructuring and recapitalization, development of more liquid capital markets, revitalization of the distressed corporate sector, and broader structural reform--are not essential and urgent. Indeed, all these elements are crucial if Japan's economy is to return to a more satisfactory rate of growth. However, I do think that ending deflation and carrying out banking, financial, corporate, and structural reforms can and should be pursued on parallel tracks, with progress being made wherever possible. Indeed, a definitive end to the deflation in consumer prices--by restoring confidence and stimulating spending--would do much to help moderate the unemployment and financial distress that might otherwise arise as the results of aggressive programs of reform and restructuring. I preface the body of my remarks with two important caveats. First, the opinions I give today are strictly my own and should not be attributed to my colleagues on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve or on the Federal Open Market Committee; nor do they reflect any official position of the United States government. Second, the remarks that follow were prepared before my visit to Japan and therefore do not reflect the discussions that I held this week with Japanese officials. Obviously, then, no inference should be made about those meetings from the comments to follow. Today I would like to consider three related issues that bear on contemporary monetary policy in Japan. First, I will discuss the option of asking the Bank of Japan to announce a quantitative objective for prices, as well as how such an objective might best be structured. Rather than proposing the more familiar inflation target, I will suggest that the BOJ consider adopting a price-level target, which would imply a period of reflation to offset the effects on prices of the recent period of deflation. Second, I would like to consider an important institutional issue, which is the relationship between the condition of the Bank of Japan's balance sheet and its ability to undertake more aggressive monetary policies. Although, in principle, balance-sheet considerations should not seriously constrain central bank policies, in practice they do. However, as I will discuss, relatively simple measures that would eliminate this constraint are available. Finally, and most important, I will consider one possible strategy for ending the deflation in Japan: explicit, though temporary, cooperation between the monetary and the fiscal authorities. Before setting off on a trip, one should know one's destination. In that spirit, a discussion of Japanese monetary policy should begin with some discussion of the policy objective. I leave until later how the objective can be achieved. The Bank of Japan Law, passed in 1998, sets price stability as a primary objective for the central bank. As with our own Federal Reserve Act, price stability is not, however, precisely defined in the Law. Currently, the BOJ has promised that the zero-interest-rate policy will be maintained until deflation is brought to an end, a policy that might be deemed consistent with the price stability objective. Two objections to this conclusion might be raised, however. First, the BOJ's statement seems to imply that the current level of policy stimulus might start to be withdrawn as soon as measured inflation returns to zero; in particular, no explicit commitment has been made to maintain inflation at zero, much less at some positive rate, in the longer run. But the presence of measurement bias in Japanese price indexes suggest that a measured inflation rate of at least one percent is likely required in order to achieve true price stability in the long run. Moreover, inflation above zero will be needed if real interest rates in Japan are to be negative for a period, as many observers think is necessary for full recovery. In short, it would be helpful if the zero-interest-rate policy were more explicit about what happens after the deflationary period ends. Second, over the past five years, since the onset of the current deflationary episode--and, incidentally, since the passage of the new Bank of Japan Law--the price level has trended down, registering a cumulative decline (depending on the price index) of between 4 and 9 percent. For example, over this period the GDP deflator has dropped nearly 9 percent, the private consumption deflator has fallen 5-1/2 percent, and wages and salaries are down 4-1/2 percent. One might argue that the legal objective of price stability should require not only a commitment to stabilize prices in the future but also a policy of actively reflating the economy, in order to restore the price level that prevailed prior to the prolonged period of deflation. As you may know, I have advocated explicit inflation targets, or at least a quantitative definition of price stability, for other leading central banks, including the Federal Reserve. A quantitative inflation target or range has been shown in many countries to be a valuable tool for communication. By clarifying the objectives of the central bank, an explicit inflation target can help to focus and anchor inflation expectations, reduce uncertainty in financial markets, and add structure to the policy framework. For Japan, given the recent history of costly deflation, however, an inflation target may not go far enough. A better strategy for Japanese monetary policy might be a publicly announced, gradually rising price-level target . What I have in mind is that the Bank of Japan would announce its intention to restore the price level (as measured by some standard index of prices, such as the consumer price index excluding fresh food) to the value it would have reached if, instead of the deflation of the past five years, a moderate inflation of, say, 1 percent per year had occurred. (I choose 1 percent to allow for the measurement bias issue noted above, and because a slightly positive average rate of inflation reduces the risk of future episodes of sustained deflation.) Note that the proposed price-level target is a moving target, equal in the year 2003 to a value approximately 5 percent above the actual price level in 1998 and rising 1 percent per year thereafter. Because deflation implies falling prices while the target price-level rises, the failure to end deflation in a given year has the effect of increasing what I have called the price-level gap (Bernanke, 2000). The price-level gap is the difference between the actual price level and the price level that would have obtained if deflation had been avoided and the price stability objective achieved in the first place. A successful effort to eliminate the price-level gap would proceed, roughly, in two stages. During the first stage, the inflation rate would exceed the long-term desired inflation rate, as the price-level gap was eliminated and the effects of previous deflation undone. Call this the reflationary phase of policy. Second, once the price-level target was reached, or nearly so, the objective for policy would become a conventional inflation target or a price-level target that increases over time at the average desired rate of inflation. Although restoration of the pre-deflation price level by means of a price-level target might be a reasonable interpretation of the BOJ's price stability objective, I would not want to push the purely legal argument too far. For example, based on a mandate for price stability, I would not ask either the BOJ or the Federal Reserve to restore the price level prevailing in their respective nations in 1950! Rather, I think the BOJ should consider a policy of reflation before re-stabilizing at a low inflation rate primarily because of the economic benefits of such a policy. One benefit of reflation would be to ease some of the intense pressure on debtors and on the financial system more generally. Since the early 1990s, borrowers in Japan have repeatedly found themselves squeezed by disinflation or deflation, which has required them to pay their debts in yen of greater value than they had expected. Borrower distress has affected the functioning of the whole economy, for example by weakening the banking system and depressing investment spending. Of course, declining asset values and the structural problems of Japanese firms have contributed greatly to debtors' problems as well, but reflation would, nevertheless, provide some relief. A period of reflation would also likely provide a boost to profits and help to break the deflationary psychology among the public, which would be positive factors for asset prices as well. Reflation--that is, a period of inflation above the long-run preferred rate in order to restore the earlier price level--proved highly beneficial following the deflations of the 1930s in both Japan and the United States. Finance Minister Korekiyo Takahashi brilliantly rescued Japan from the Great Depression through reflationary policies in the early 1930s, while President Franklin D. Roosevelt's reflationary monetary and banking policies did the same for the United States in 1933 and subsequent years. In both cases, the turnaround was amazingly rapid. In the United States, for example, prices fell at a 10.3 percent rate in 1932 but rose 0.8 percent in 1933 and more briskly thereafter. Moreover, during the year that followed Roosevelt's inauguration in March 1933, the U.S. stock market rallied by 77 percent. Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) have advanced a second argument for a price-level target for Japan in an important recent paper on monetary policy at the zero bound. These authors point out (as have many others) that, when nominal interest rates are at or near zero, the central bank can lower the real rate of interest only by creating expectations of inflation on the part of the public. Eggertsson and Woodford argue that a publicly announced price-level target of the type just described is more conducive to raising near-term inflation expectations than is an inflation target. One way to understand their argument is to imagine that the public expects the leaders of the central bank to take more aggressive actions, the further they are from their announced objective. Now suppose that, in an economy experiencing a stable deflation, the central bank leadership announces a fixed inflation target but then makes no progress toward that target during a given period. Then in the next period, the central bank is in the same position as previously, in terms of its distance from its objective; hence, by hypothesis, the central bank has no incentive to increase its effort to meet the announced target, and the public has no reason to expect it to do so. In this respect the inflation target is too ""forgiving"" an objective; failure is not penalized, nor is greater effort demanded. In contrast, under a price-level-targeting scheme, continuing deflation combined with an upward-sloping path for the price-level target causes the size of the price-level gap to increase over time. Thus, failure by the central bank to meet its target in a given period leads to expectations of (and public demands for) increased effort in subsequent periods--greater quantities of assets purchased on the open market, for example. So even if the central bank is reluctant to provide a time frame for meeting its objective, the structure of the price-level objective provides a means for the bank to commit to increasing its anti-deflationary efforts when its earlier efforts prove unsuccessful. As Eggertsson and Woodford show, the expectation that an increasing price level gap will give rise to intensified effort by the central bank should lead the public to believe that ultimately inflation will replace deflation, a belief that supports the central bank's own objectives by lowering the current real rate of interest. A concern that one might have about price-level targeting, as opposed to more conventional inflation targeting, is that it requires a short-term inflation rate that is higher than the long-term inflation objective. Is there not some danger of inflation overshooting, so that a deflation problem is replaced with an inflation problem? No doubt this concern has some basis, and ultimately one has to make a judgment. However, on the other side of the scale, I would put the following points: first, the benefits to the real economy of a more rapid restoration of the pre-deflation price level and second, the fact that the publicly announced price-level targets would help the Bank of Japan manage public expectations and to draw the distinction between a one-time price-level correction and the BOJ's longer-run inflation objective. If this distinction can be made, the effect of the reflation program on inflation expectations and long-term nominal interest rates should be smaller than if all reflation is interpreted as a permanent increase in inflation. Discussing the optimal objectives for Japanese monetary policy is all very well, but what of the argument, advanced by some officials, that the Bank of Japan lacks the tools to achieve these objectives? Without denying the many difficulties inherent in making monetary policy in the current environment in Japan, I believe that not all the possible methods for easing monetary policy in Japan have been fully exploited. One possible approach to ending deflation in Japan would be greater cooperation, for a limited time, between the monetary and the fiscal authorities. Specifically, the Bank of Japan should consider increasing still further its purchases of government debt, preferably in explicit conjunction with a program of tax cuts or other fiscal stimulus. Before going into more detail about this possibility, however, I want to discuss a specific institutional factor that currently constrains--somewhat artificially, I would argue--the ability of the Bank of Japan to pursue more aggressive policies, including both so-called non-conventional and more-orthodox policies. This institutional constraint, often cited by BOJ officials, is the condition of the BOJ's balance sheet, and the fear, in particular, that a successful program of reflation might inflict capital losses on the BOJ and thereby weaken its institutional position. Like other central banks, the Bank of Japan has a balance sheet, with assets, liabilities, and capital. Also like other central banks, the BOJ purchases interest-bearing assets with money that it creates and thus typically earns significant profits, or seignorage. Some of these profits are used to cover the expenses of the BOJ itself, subject to review by the Ministry of Finance (MOF). The BOJ also has reserves for possible losses on securities and foreign exchange transactions and is permitted by the Article 53 of the Bank of Japan Law to retain 5 percent of the surplus from the settlement of profits and losses as a reserve fund. The portion of the surplus not retained by the Bank is paid to the national treasury. From the point of view of conventional private-sector accounting--which, as I will discuss, is not necessarily the correct standard in this case--the BOJ's balance sheet has become noticeably riskier in recent years. For example, the BOJ's most recent financial statement showed that of the 68 percent of its assets held in the form of government securities, about two-thirds are long-term Japanese government bonds (JGBs). This represents a very substantial increase over customary levels in the BOJ's holdings of long-term government debt. Because yields on government bonds are currently so low, these holdings expose the BOJ's balance sheet to considerable interest-rate risk (although any losses would be partly offset by unrealized capital gains on earlier acquisitions of bonds). Indeed, ironically, if the Bank of Japan were to succeed in replacing deflation with a low but positive rate of inflation, its reward would likely be substantial capital losses in the value of its government bond holdings arising from the resulting increase in long-term nominal interest rates. With such concerns in mind, BOJ officials have said that a strengthening of the Bank's capital base is needed to allow it to pursue more aggressive monetary policy easing. In fact, the BOJ recently requested that it be allowed to retain 15 percent (rather than 5 percent) of the surplus for the 2002 fiscal year that just ended to increase its capital, and the Ministry of Finance has indicated that it will approve the request. Even with this additional cushion, however, concerns on the part of the BOJ about its balance sheet are likely to remain. The public debate over the BOJ's capital should not distract us from the underlying economics of the situation. In particular, the private shareholders notwithstanding, the Bank of Japan is not a private commercial bank. It cannot go bankrupt in the sense that a private firm can, and the usual reasons that a commercial bank holds capital--to reduce incentives for excessive risk-taking, for example--do not directly apply to the BOJ. Indeed, putting aside psychological and symbolic reasons, important as these may be in some circumstances, there appear to be only two conceivable effects of the BOJ's balance sheet position on its ability to conduct normal operations. First, if the BOJ's income were too low to support its current expenditure budget, the Bank might be forced to ask the MOF for supplemental funds, which the BOJ might fear would put its independence at risk. This consideration by itself should not necessarily make the BOJ less willing to undertake more aggressive monetary policies, however, because purchasing additional assets with non-zero yields, even if these assets are risky or illiquid, normally increases the Bank's current income. Second, an imaginable, though quite unlikely, possibility is that the Bank could suffer sufficient capital losses on its assets to make it unable to conduct open-market sales of securities on a scale large enough to meet its monetary policy objectives. In short, one could make an economic case that the balance sheet of the central bank should be of marginal relevance at best to the determination of monetary policy. Rather than engage in what would probably be a heated and unproductive debate over the issue, however, I would propose instead that the Japanese government just fix the problem, thereby eliminating this concern from the BOJ's list of worries. There are many essentially costless ways to fix it. I am intrigued by a simple proposal that I understand has been suggested by the Japanese Business Federation, the Nippon Keidanren. Under this proposal the Ministry of Finance would convert the fixed interest rates of the Japanese government bonds held by the Bank of Japan into floating interest rates. This ""bond conversion""--actually, a fixed-floating interest rate swap--would protect the capital position of the Bank of Japan from increases in long-term interest rates and remove much of the balance sheet risk associated with open-market operations in government securities. Moreover, the budgetary implications of this proposal would be essentially zero, since any increase in interest payments to the BOJ by the MOF arising from the bond conversion would be offset by an almost equal increase in the BOJ's payouts to the national treasury. The budgetary neutrality of the proposal is of course a consequence of the fact that, as a matter of arithmetic, any capital gains or losses in the value of government securities held by the BOJ are precisely offset by opposite changes in the net worth of the issuer of those securities, the government treasury. Although the MOF could insulate, without budgetary cost, the BOJ's balance sheet from interest-rate risk on its holdings of government bonds, a similar program offered by the MOF to private-sector holders of bonds, such as commercial banks, would not be costless from the MOF's point of view, if inflation and interest rates were subsequently to rise. However, if the MOF entered into the proposed swap agreement with the BOJ, new purchases of government bonds from the private sector by the Bank of Japan would be costless to the national treasury. Thus, conditional on the swap arrangement being in force, open-market purchases of government bonds by the BOJ would combine an expansionary monetary policy with a reduction of interest-rate risk in the banking system at no budgetary cost. The simple step of immunizing the BOJ's balance sheet thus opens a number of interesting policy options. The bond conversion (or interest-rate swap) just described is all that would be needed to protect the BOJ's balance sheet against any side effects from operations in government bonds. Incidentally, the approach could be extended to insulate the BOJ's balance sheet against potentially adverse effects of other types of asset purchases that the government might want to encourage. For example, to facilitate expanded purchases of asset-backed commercial paper, the government might agree, on request of the BOJ, to exchange government debt of the same maturity for the commercial paper. The net effect would be that the fiscal authority would assume the credit risk flowing from the nonstandard monetary policy action, as seems appropriate. What should the Bank of Japan give up in exchange for the Ministry of Finance's removing a significant amount of risk from the BOJ's balance sheet? One option would be for the Bank to use its increased ability to bear risk to undertake new policy actions that would entail accepting other types of risk onto its balance sheet. Today I will argue for a different approach and suggest that the Bank of Japan cooperate temporarily with the government to create an environment of combined monetary and fiscal ease to end deflation and help restart economic growth in Japan. To do this, the BOJ might have to scrap rules that it has set for itself--for example, its informal rule that the quantity of long-term government bonds on its balance sheet must be kept below the outstanding balance of banknotes issued. There is no unique solution to the problem of continuing declines in Japanese prices; a variety of policies are worth trying, alone or in combination. However, one fairly direct and practical approach is explicit (though temporary) cooperation between the monetary and the fiscal authorities. Let me try to explain why I think this direction is promising and may succeed where monetary and fiscal policies applied separately have not. Demand on the part of both consumers and potential purchasers of new capital equipment in Japan remains quite depressed, and resources are not being fully utilized. Normally, the central bank would respond to such a situation by lowering the short-term nominal interest rate, but that rate is now effectively zero. Other strategies for the central bank acting alone exist, including buying alternative assets to try to lower term or liquidity premiums and attempting to influence expectations of future inflation through announcements or commitments to expand the monetary base. The Bank of Japan has taken some steps in these directions but has generally been reluctant to go as far as it might, in part because of the difficulty in determining the quantitative impact of such actions and in part because of the Bank's view that problems in the banking system have ""jammed"" the usual channels of monetary policy transmission. Ironically, this obvious reluctance on the part of the BOJ to sail into uncharted waters may have had the effect of muting the psychological impact of the nonstandard actions it has taken. Likewise the Bank of Japan has resisted calls to manage the value of the yen (see, for example, McCallum, 2000, or Svensson, 2001), citing its lack of authority to do so as well as the prospect of retaliation from trading partners. The alternative approach to stimulating aggregate demand is fiscal policy--government spending increases or tax cuts. Here again the perception is that policy has been less than successful, although Posen (1998)--in a criticism reminiscent of those who have complained that the Bank of Japan should just ""do more""--has argued that the problem is less that fiscal policy is ineffective than that it has not been used to the extent that one might gather from official plans and announcements. In Posen's view, Japan's debt problem is primarily the result of slow economic growth rather than active fiscal policies. However, besides possibly inconsistent application of fiscal stimulus, another reason for weak fiscal effects in Japan may be the well-publicized size of the government debt. The severity of the government debt problem may be overstated in some respects--95 percent of the outstanding debt is domestically held, for example, and 59 percent is held by public institutions, so that the Japanese people truly ""owe the debt to themselves""--but that the government's annual deficit is now about 8 percent of GDP is nevertheless a serious concern. Moreover, an aging Japanese population will add to the government's budgetary burden in coming decades. In addition to making policymakers more reluctant to use expansionary fiscal policies in the first place, Japan's large national debt may dilute the effect of fiscal policies in those instances when they are used. For example, people may be more inclined to save rather than spend tax cuts when they know that the cuts increase future government interest costs and thus raise future tax payments for themselves or their children. (It is striking that, despite low interest rates, about 20 percent of the Japanese central government budget, or about 16.8 trillion yen this year, is devoted to servicing the national debt.) In economics textbooks, the idea that people will save rather than spend tax cuts because of the implied increase in future tax obligations is known as the principle of Ricardian equivalence. In general, the evidence for Ricardian equivalence in real economies is mixed, but it seems most likely to apply in a situation like that prevailing today in Japan, in which people have been made highly aware of the potential burden of the national debt. The principle of Ricardian equivalence does not apply exactly to increases in government purchases (for example, road building) but it may apply there approximately. If, for example, people think that government spending projects are generally wasteful and add little to national wealth or productivity, then taxpayers may view increased government spending as simply increasing the burden of the government debt that they must bear. If, as a result, they react to increases in government spending by reducing their own expenditure, the net stimulative effect of fiscal actions will be reduced. In short, to strengthen the effects of fiscal policy, it would be helpful to break the link between expansionary fiscal actions today and increases in the taxes that people expect to pay tomorrow. My thesis here is that cooperation between the monetary and fiscal authorities in Japan could help solve the problems that each policymaker faces on its own. Consider for example a tax cut for households and businesses that is explicitly coupled with incremental BOJ purchases of government debt--so that the tax cut is in effect financed by money creation. Moreover, assume that the Bank of Japan has made a commitment, by announcing a price-level target, to reflate the economy, so that much or all of the increase in the money stock is viewed as permanent. Under this plan, the BOJ's balance sheet is protected by the bond conversion program, and the government's concerns about its outstanding stock of debt are mitigated because increases in its debt are purchased by the BOJ rather than sold to the private sector. Moreover, consumers and businesses should be willing to spend rather than save the bulk of their tax cut: They have extra cash on hand, but--because the BOJ purchased government debt in the amount of the tax cut--no current or future debt service burden has been created to imply increased future taxes. Essentially, monetary and fiscal policies together have increased the nominal wealth of the household sector, which will increase nominal spending and hence prices. The health of the banking sector is irrelevant to this means of transmitting the expansionary effect of monetary policy, addressing the concern of BOJ officials about ""broken"" channels of monetary transmission. This approach also responds to the reservation of BOJ officials that the Bank ""lacks the tools"" to reach a price-level or inflation target. Isn't it irresponsible to recommend a tax cut, given the poor state of Japanese public finances? To the contrary, from a fiscal perspective, the policy would almost certainly be stabilizing, in the sense of reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio. The BOJ's purchases would leave the nominal quantity of debt in the hands of the public unchanged, while nominal GDP would rise owing to increased nominal spending. Indeed, nothing would help reduce Japan's fiscal woes more than healthy growth in nominal GDP and hence in tax revenues. Potential roles for monetary-fiscal cooperation are not limited to BOJ support of tax cuts. BOJ purchases of government debt could also support spending programs, to facilitate industrial restructuring, for example. The BOJ's purchases would mitigate the effect of the new spending on the burden of debt and future interest payments perceived by households, which should reduce the offset from decreased consumption. More generally, by replacing interest-bearing debt with money, BOJ purchases of government debt lower current deficits and interest burdens and thus the public's expectations of future tax obligations. Of course, one can never get something for nothing; from a public finance perspective, increased monetization of government debt simply amounts to replacing other forms of taxes with an inflation tax. But, in the context of deflation-ridden Japan, generating a little bit of positive inflation (and the associated increase in nominal spending) would help achieve the goals of promoting economic recovery and putting idle resources back to work, which in turn would boost tax revenue and improve the government's fiscal position. The Bank of Japan became fully independent only in 1998, and it has guarded its independence carefully, as is appropriate.

6619,r040520c_FOMC,united states,2004-05-20,NO_INFO,gramlich,0,"The Federal Reserve System has a long history as a promoter and provider of consumer education. An increasingly complex global financial system requires consumers to have a strong working knowledge of financial concepts. To highlight the importance of financial education and to make people aware of the multitude of financial education resources that are available to them, the Federal Reserve System launched a national public campaign that began in May 2003. But before we launched a public campaign, we began putting together a serious program of workplace education for our own Board employees. In November 2002, we sponsored a roundtable with fifteen to twenty employers that we identified as having active workplace education programs. Attendees, representing Reserve Banks, private corporations, and government agencies, discussed goals, plans, and how to get started. This group suggested some key features that we built into our own program. One was to make financial education a lifetime responsibility, for us and our employees. Another was to keep information current, relevant, and responsive to changing conditions. A third was to provide information through a range of vehicles. From this session we gathered information on best practices and formed an internal task force to plan, coordinate, and evaluate these efforts. The task force developed ongoing objectives for the program that include increasing employees' understanding of how Board-sponsored benefit programs can contribute to short- and long-term financial well-being, improving employees' knowledge of basic financial concepts and improving their capability to make personal finance decisions, encouraging employees to adopt financial management behaviors that will help them increase their short- and long-term savings and better manage or eliminate debt, and evaluating the impact of workplace financial education on participation in Board benefit programs and financial behavior through appropriate metrics. To carry out our objectives, we use a variety of methods. We host lunch-time seminars, offer morning or afternoon programs, and place articles and educational materials on our internal electronic newsletter. We are also developing an internal web site designed to improve employees' knowledge of finance, benefits, health, and career development issues. Our programs and educational materials cover a variety of topics. ""Making Sense of Your Credit Report"" provides information on the factors that can positively or negatively affect a credit report. ""College Savings: Making Education Your Financial Goal"" discusses education as a financial goal and presents information on Coverdell Education Savings Accounts, U.S. Savings Bonds, and Qualified Tuition Programs as types of savings vehicles for achieving that goal. Programs on estate planning and retirement are offered, as well as seminars on financial planning and advanced investment. Many of these programs are geared to those employees who have been in the workforce for many years. However, understanding that many of our young people don't receive formal course work in financial matters, we designed a program that is more meaningful to new professionals. This program, which is designed for those young people just entering the workforce, discusses the importance of starting to save at a young age, homeownership, advanced education, and avoiding debt. Workplace education benefits both the employer and employee. For the employee, more knowledge, one hopes, will result in better financial decisions and overall financial well-being. Employees who are taking maximum advantage of the benefits available to them will more likely have greater job satisfaction, which may result in lower turnover. For the employer, research studies have shown that employees who are financially healthy are more productive. They are absent less often, spend less time at the workplace dealing with financial crises, and earn higher job performance ratings. We commend the Commission for recognizing workplace education as an integral component in formulating a national financial education strategy.

6800,r060831a_FOMC,united states,2006-08-31,Productivity,bernanke,1,"The Federal Reserve, the central bank of the United States, provides the nation with a safe, flexible, and stable monetary and financial system. One of the most important economic developments in the United States in the past decade or so has been a sustained increase in the growth rate of labor productivity, or output per hour of work. From the early 1970s until about 1995, productivity growth in the U.S. nonfarm business sector averaged about 1-1/2 percent per year--a disappointingly low figure relative both to U.S. historical experience and to the performance of other industrial economies over the same period. Between 1995 and 2000, however, the rate of productivity growth picked up significantly, to about 2-1/2 percent per year--a figure that contributed to the view, held by many at the time, that the United States might be entering a new economic era. Talk of the ""new economy"" faded with the sharp declines in the stock valuations of high-tech firms at the turn of the millennium. Yet, remarkably, productivity accelerated further in the early part of this decade. From the end of 2000 to the end of 2003, productivity rose at a 3-1/2 percent annual rate and, even after recent downward revisions to the data, it is estimated to have increased at an average annual rate of 2-1/4 percent since the end of 2003. These advances were achieved despite adverse developments that included the 2001 recession, the terrorist attacks of September 11, corporate governance scandals, and in the past few years, devastating hurricanes and very substantial increases in the cost of energy. Why is the rate of productivity growth so important? Economists agree that, in the long run, productivity growth is the principal source of improvements in living standards. The logic is simple: In the long run, what we can consume as a nation is closely tied to how much we can produce. The link between the growth of productivity and the standard of living of the average person is somewhat looser in the short-to-medium run, because variation in factors such as the share of the population that is employed, the division of income between capital and labor, and the distribution of each type of income across households also matters. Nevertheless, the rate of productivity growth influences the economy in important ways even in the short run, affecting key variables such as the growth rate of output, employment gains, and the rate of inflation. Today I will discuss the acceleration of productivity that has occurred over the past decade and our current understanding of its causes. In the discussion I will comment on two puzzles raised by this improved performance and then conclude by briefly addressing the longer-term prospects for productivity growth in the United States. What underlies the resurgence in U.S. productivity growth? Explanations of the rise in productivity growth since about 1995 have evolved somewhat over time. By 2000 or so, an emerging consensus held that the pickup in productivity growth was, for the most part, the product of both rapid technological progress and increased investment in new information and communication technologies (IT) during the 1990s (see Jorgenson and Stiroh, 2000, and Oliner and Sichel, 2000). According to this view, developments in IT promoted U.S. productivity growth in two ways. First, technological advances allowed the IT-producing sectors themselves to exhibit rapid productivity growth. For example, the development of more-reliable semiconductor manufacturing equipment and faster wafer-inspection technologies increased the rate at which companies such as Intel were able to produce microprocessors. Intel was also able to shorten its product cycle and increase the frequency of new chip releases, shifting its product mix toward more-powerful and, consequently, higher-value chips. Both the more-rapid pace of production and the higher average quality of output raised productivity at Intel as well as at competing firms that were forced to keep pace. Second, advances in information technology also promoted productivity growth outside the IT-producing sector, as firms in a wide range of industries expanded their investments in high-tech equipment and software and used the new technologies to reduce costs and increase quality. Some large retailers, for example, developed IT-based tools to improve the management of their supply chains and to increase their responsiveness to changes in the level and mix of customer demands. Securities brokers and dealers achieved substantial productivity gains by automating their trading processes and their back-office operations. In the durable goods sector, automobile producers developed programmable tooling systems to increase the flexibility of their manufacturing processes--for example, to permit vehicles based on different platforms to be produced on the same assembly line. One study (Stiroh, 2002) found that a majority of U.S. industries experienced an acceleration of productivity in the latter part of the 1990s. Significantly, the study also found the gains to be the greatest in industries that use IT capital most intensively. Undoubtedly, the IT revolution and the resurgence of productivity in the United States after 1995 were closely connected. However, the technology-based explanation of increased productivity growth does raise a couple of puzzles (see, for example, McKinsey and Company, 2001 and 2005, and Basu and others, 2003). First, the United States was not the only country to have access to the new technologies or to have experienced a rapid expansion in IT investment; other industrial countries also invested heavily in these technologies in the 1980s and 1990s. Yet, with a few exceptions, the available data show that productivity growth in other advanced countries has not increased to the extent seen in the United States. Second, as I have noted, productivity growth increased very rapidly earlier this decade and has continued to rise at a solid pace, even though IT investment declined sharply after the stock prices of high-tech firms plummeted in 2000. More generally, as a historical matter, increases in IT investment have not always been followed in short order by increases in productivity growth. This observation raises the question of why, in some cases, the putative productivity benefits of investments in new technologies do not occur until years after those investments are made. In regard to the first puzzle--the fact that the United States has enjoyed greater productivity growth in recent years than other advanced countries--the comparison with Europe is particularly interesting. Throughout most of the post-World War II period, productivity growth in Europe exceeded that in the United States, at first because of the rapid gains during the postwar reconstruction and then later because of a gradual convergence of European technology and business practices to American standards. By one estimate, European productivity increased from 44 percent of the U.S. level in 1950 to near-equality with the United States by 1995 (Gordon, 2004 and 2006). However, the available data suggest that, since about 1995, productivity growth in European nations has slowed, on average, in contrast to the pickup experienced in the United States. These trends have led to an increasing divergence in productivity levels in the United States and Europe (see van Ark and Inklaar, 2005). Researchers have made the important point that differences in productivity growth between the United States and Europe appear not to have been particularly large in the IT- producing sectors, where U.S. strengths in the development of computers and semiconductors have been partly offset by European leadership in communications. Rather, the U.S. advantage has been most evident in the IT- using sectors, which have performed better in the United States than elsewhere. What accounts for this apparent U.S. advantage? Differences in economic policies and systems likely have accounted for some of the differences in the performance of productivity. One leading explanation for the strong U.S. productivity growth is that labor markets in the United States tend to be more flexible and competitive, market characteristics that have allowed the United States to realize greater economic benefits from new technologies. For example, taking full advantage of new information and communication technologies may require extensive reorganization of work practices, the reassignment and retraining of workers, and ultimately some reallocation of labor among firms and industries. Regulations that raise the costs of hiring and firing workers and that reduce employers' ability to change work assignments--like those that exist in a number of European countries--may make such changes more difficult to achieve. Likewise, in product markets, a high degree of competition and low barriers to the entry of new firms in most industries in the United States provide strong incentives for firms to find ways to cut costs and to improve their products. In some other countries, in contrast, the prominence of government-owned firms with a degree of monopoly power, together with a regulatory environment that protects incumbent firms and makes the entry of new firms difficult, reduces the competitive pressure for innovation and the application of new ideas. For example, some economists have argued that restrictions on land use and on shopping hours in Europe have impeded the development of ""big box"" retail outlets, reducing competition and denying European firms the economies of scale that have been important for productivity growth in the retail sector in the United States (Gordon, 2004). More generally, recent empirical research has typically found that economies with highly regulated labor and product markets are indeed less able to make productive use of new technologies (Gust and Marquez, 2004). Also, although it is not a feature unique to the United States, the increasing degree of openness of our economy to trade and foreign investment and the consequent exposure of U.S. companies to the rigors of international as well as domestic competition, may have promoted productivity growth. As a leading example, productivity gains in U.S. manufacturing--which is particularly subject to international competition--have been especially impressive in recent years, averaging, by one measure, about 6 percent per year over the past decade. A number of other explanations have been advanced for the relatively stronger performance of productivity in the United States in recent years, including international differences in management practices, the depth and sophistication of U.S. capital markets, more favorable attitudes toward competition and entrepreneurship in the United States, and the role of U.S. research universities in fostering innovation. Further study of national productivity differentials clearly is warranted. The second productivity puzzle relates to the further acceleration in productivity that occurred earlier in this decade despite the decline in IT investment after 2000 and the rather modest recovery in recent years. Again, a number of explanations have been proposed, including business restructuring and an even more rapid pace of technical change and of the diffusion of technological advances. It is interesting, however, that the recent episode is not the first time that we have seen productivity improvements lagging well behind investments in new technology. Notably, computers were first commercialized in the 1950s, and personal computers began to come into widespread use in the early 1980s; but until the mid-1990s, these developments had little evident effect on measures of productivity. Indeed, an oft-quoted quip by economist Robert Solow held that, as of the late 1980s, ""computers are everywhere except in the productivity statistics."" In attempting to explain the tendency of productivity growth to lag behind investments in new technologies, economists have emphasized that much more than the purchase of new high-tech equipment is needed to achieve significant gains in productivity. In particular, to be successful, managers must have a carefully thought-out plan for using new technologies before they acquire them. Case studies of individual industries show that the planning for technological modernization has not always been adequate, with the result that some purchases of high-tech equipment and software have not added much to productivity or profits. The idea that managers can buy the hardware first and then decide what to do with it does not square with the evidence. Some observers have characterized the new information and communication technologies as general-purpose technologies , which means that--like earlier major innovations such as electrification and the internal combustion engine--they have the potential to revolutionize production and make many new goods and services available to consumers (see Bresnahan and Trajtenberg, 1995). To make effective use of such a technology within a specific firm or industry, however, managers must supplement their purchases of new equipment with investments in firm- or industry-specific research and development, worker training, and organizational redesign--all examples of what economists call intangible capital . Although investments in intangible capital are, for the most part, not counted as capital investment in the national income and product accounts, they appear to be quantitatively important. One recent study estimated that, by the late 1990s, investments in intangible capital by U.S. businesses were as large as investments in traditional tangible capital such as buildings and machines (Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel, 2006). Recognizing the importance of intangible capital has several interesting implications. First, because investment in intangible capital is typically treated as a current expense rather than as an investment, aggregate saving and investment may be significantly understated in the U.S. official statistics. Second, firms' need to invest in intangible capital--and thus to divert resources from the production of market goods or services--helps to explain why measured output and productivity may decline or grow slowly during the period after firms adopt new technologies. Finally, the concept of intangible capital may shed light on the puzzle of why productivity growth has remained strong despite the deceleration in IT investment. Because investments in high-tech capital typically require complementary investments in intangible capital for productivity gains to be realized, the benefits of high-tech investment may become visible only after an extended period during which firms are making the necessary investments in intangibles. Historical analyses of the sources of fluctuations in productivity growth are challenging, but not nearly so challenging as trying to predict how productivity will evolve in the future. However, because the rate of productivity growth is a primary determinant of economic performance, policymakers have few options other than to try to forecast future gains in productivity. For example, estimates of long-term productivity growth are needed to determine the rate of output growth that the economy can sustain in the long run without generating inflationary pressures. The task of trying to predict the behavior of productivity in the medium-to-long run is complicated by the fact that productivity growth generally varies with the business cycle, tending to be below its longer-term trend when the economy is contracting and above that trend when the economy is in the early stages of an expansion (see Basu and Fernald, 2001, for a discussion). (This well-documented pattern makes the strong growth of productivity during the early part of this decade, a period that featured a recession and generally slow growth, all the more remarkable.) Economists use statistical methods to try to abstract from cyclical influences to determine the longer-term trend in productivity. What do they find? As of a couple of years ago, the consensus among leading researchers was that productivity in the nonfarm business sector was likely to grow at about 2-1/2 percent per year in the longer term, close to the rate of productivity growth achieved during the 1995 to 2000 period (see, for example, Baily, 2003; Gordon, 2003; and Jorgenson, Ho, and Stiroh, 2004). On the one hand, recent data revisions to the national income and product accounts have shown that productivity growth over the past few years was slightly weaker than we thought, leading some analysts to revise down their estimates of trend productivity growth about 1/4 percentage point or so per year. On the other hand, the fact that productivity growth has remained solid in recent years increases confidence that a larger fraction of those productivity gains reflects longer-term developments and a smaller fraction reflects cyclical factors. On net, the recent experience does not appear to require a significant rethinking of long-term productivity trends. Indeed, recent estimates by leading economists continue to peg the expected longer-term rate of productivity growth at roughly 2-1/2 percent per year. Of course, as the saying goes, past returns do not guarantee future results, and not all the evidence supports this optimistic view of productivity trends. For example, although spending on high-tech equipment and software has recovered noticeably from its recent lows, growth in IT spending remains well below the rates observed before the 2001 recession. Some industry participants have suggested that less-rapid growth in IT spending may reflect the absence of major new business applications for IT--""killer apps,"" as they are called. Moreover, until we have a more complete understanding of the factors behind productivity growth in the past five years, we should be cautious in drawing any strong conclusions about the future. These caveats notwithstanding, a case can be made that the strong productivity growth of the post-1995 era is likely to continue for some time. Notably, the price of computing power continues to fall sharply, having declined by nearly half in the five years between 2000 and 2005. Increased computing power has in turn contributed to advances in other fields, such as biotechnology, and has helped to increase the range of goods and services available to businesses and consumers. Moreover, whatever the pace of future technological progress, further diffusion of already-existing technologies and applications to more firms and industries should continue to increase aggregate productivity for a time. I have focused today on how technological change and investment, both tangible and intangible, promote productivity growth. I will close by noting that, from the perspective of society as a whole, a particularly important form of intangible investment in future years will be investment in the skills of the U.S. labor force. As we know from everyday experience, few jobs or occupations have not been affected in some way by the technological changes of recent years, a trend that will certainly continue. Not only scientists and engineers but also nurses, auto mechanics, and factory workers now use advanced technologies every day. But new technologies will translate into higher productivity only to the extent that workers have the skills needed to apply them effectively. Moreover, because technology is always changing, the acquisition of those skills has become a lifelong challenge, one that continues well after formal education is completed. If the recent gains in productivity growth are to be sustained, ensuring that we have a workforce that is comfortable with and adaptable to new technologies will be essential. . . . I will use ""labor productivity"" and ""productivity"" interchangeably in my remarks today. An alternative productivity concept, multifactor productivity, measures the quantity of output that can be produced by a given combination of capital and labor. Changes in labor productivity reflect changes in both multifactor productivity and the amount of capital per worker.

6866,r070910a_FOMC,united states,2007-09-10,Outlook and Risks for the U.S. Economy,mishkin,0,"The Federal Reserve, the central bank of the United States, provides the nation with a safe, flexible, and stable monetary and financial system. Thank you for the invitation to be here this evening. It is always a pleasure to be back in my hometown, and it is a particular pleasure to have a chance to talk again with the Money Marketeers. At the outset, I would like to acknowledge that tomorrow marks the sixth anniversary of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and United Flight 93, which crashed in Pennsylvania. The anniversary weighs on the minds of Americans everywhere, and it weighs especially heavily on members of the New York financial community. That terrible day and its aftermath remind us that resilience is a defining characteristic not just of our economy and financial system but also of our country and our city. For as long as anyone who experienced it is alive, the memory of that awful day will not fade. In my remarks this evening, I will review the current economic situation and outlook and make some specific observations about recent developments in financial markets. I should note that the views I will express here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). As everyone in this room knows, financial markets have been front and center in recent discussions about the economy. The FOMC noted on August 17 that financial market conditions deteriorated last month and that the associated tighter credit conditions and increased uncertainty have the potential to restrain economic growth going forward. Indeed, at this point, housing demand seems likely to be crimped further by a marked reduction in the availability of mortgages, and consumer and business spending also could be damped as a consequence of the recent financial turmoil. In light of these events, we will need to make the best possible real-time judgments about the extent to which the recent developments in financial markets are likely to affect economic activity in the period ahead. That said, the economy ended the second quarter on a positive note. The Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis recently reported that the economy expanded at an annual rate of 4 percent in the second quarter, about 1/2 percentage point higher than the first estimate. Of course, the jump in growth followed a sluggish first-quarter gain: That choppiness in growth reflected large swings in several factors that are often volatile, including inventory investment, federal defense outlays, and net exports. Smoothing through this volatility, the underlying pattern of activity in the first half of the year essentially represented a continuation of the moderate growth that had prevailed since the spring of last year when growth in real gross domestic product stepped down from an above-trend pace. Many of the spending indicators for the current quarter have remained consistent with that earlier trend. However, for the most part, these data cover a period that predates the recent onset of financial turbulence. The step-down in the growth of real output that began in mid-2006 and proceeded through the middle of this year primarily reflected weakness in the housing market. Declines in real residential investment subtracted nearly 1-1/4 percentage points from the growth of real GDP in the second half of last year and about 3/4 percentage point in the first half of this year. Moreover, the demand for housing appears to be weakening further amid credit conditions for home mortgage lending that are generally tighter, but especially so in the subprime segment. Sales of existing single-family homes in July were more than 20 percent below their peak in mid-2005, while sales of new homes in July were more than 37 percent below their peak. Although housing starts have also moved down over the past year, the decline thus far has lagged the downturn in sales, and the backlog of unsold new homes has climbed to a very high level relative to sales. Given this sizable backlog and the likelihood that sales will remain weak or weaken further in coming months, cutbacks in housing construction are likely to continue to be a drag on economic activity in future quarters. Turning to consumer spending, real outlays decelerated considerably in the second quarter. To some extent, a moderation from the very rapid pace of growth around the turn of the year probably was to be expected. In the second quarter, in particular, a jump in energy prices eroded the purchasing power of gains in household income, placing downward pressure on the growth of real spending at that point. Even so, early indications are that household spending is holding up reasonably well thus far in the current quarter: Real outlays for goods excluding motor vehicles posted a solid increase in July, and sales of light motor vehicles--which had slumped in June and July--rebounded last month. Having said that, several factors suggest that consumer spending will be subdued in the period ahead. This summer's retrenchment in equity markets and the sharp deceleration in house prices have damped gains in household wealth this year and are likely to restrain consumer outlays. Moreover, at least some households are likely to find it more difficult or expensive to borrow, and consumer sentiment--which turned down in August--could soften further if households become more anxious about recent financial market developments. Business investment in equipment and software weakened toward the end of last year and remained sluggish in the first quarter. In part, the slowing reflected a downturn in outlays for capital goods that are used heavily by the motor vehicle and construction industries, two sectors in which activity had softened considerably. But spending on other types of equipment also was soft in the first quarter. In the second quarter, however, demand for these other types of equipment bounced back strongly, and the gains were extended in July--as reported in the most recent data on orders and shipments of capital goods. We have no direct readings on capital spending in August, but the limited indicators currently in hand--such as the Institute for Supply Management's survey of purchasing managers--have held up reasonably well and remain at levels consistent with modest growth in manufacturing production and business investment. Of course, all this could change noticeably if many firms were to face significantly tighter credit conditions or if business sentiment were to soften appreciably. Regarding international developments, the recent deterioration in financial market conditions has had effects around the world, but the economies of our major trading partners appear set to continue their expansion. That growth should continue to stimulate demand for U.S. exports of goods and services. Turning to the labor market, payroll employment has weakened. As reported on Friday, nonfarm payrolls fell 4,000 last month, and private payrolls rose only 24,000. Smoothing through the recent monthly numbers, private payrolls increased an average of about 70,000 per month over the past three months; this is down from gains near 120,000 per month in the first five months of the year and about 165,000 per month in the second half of 2006. As for the economy's longer-run growth rate, a key determinant is the trend in labor productivity. As you know, from 1995 to 2000, productivity in the nonfarm business sector increased at an average annual rate of 2-1/2 percent, well above the lackluster pace of the preceding twenty-five years. Then, remarkably, productivity accelerated further, rising at an average of about 3-1/2 percent per year for the first three years of this decade, despite the challenges of a recession, the fall of the dot-com market, a broad stock market correction, and the terrorist attacks. Since the middle of 2004, however, the growth of labor productivity has slowed, registering an average annual rate of about 1-1/4 percent. Previously, that figure had looked higher, but this summer's annual revision of the national income and product accounts marked down productivity growth over the 2004 to 2006 period by an average of 0.3 percentage point per year. Part of the recent deceleration in productivity almost surely reflects a typical cyclical response to a slowing economy. The difficult questions, of course, are whether some of the recent slowing also reflects a downshift in the underlying trend, and, if so, to what extent? The latest evidence suggests that structural productivity might be increasing somewhat more slowly than it did during the second half of the 1990s, but the confidence band around any such estimate of trend productivity growth surely is very wide. These issues remain an area of active debate, the outcome of which will be essential for gauging the economy's potential rate of growth going forward. Let me turn now to inflation and inflation dynamics. Over the past year, the price index for total personal consumption expenditures (PCE) rose 2.1 percent, down from nearly 3-1/2 percent during the comparable period twelve months earlier. Recently, topline inflation has been boosted by sizable increases in food prices; energy-price increases slowed considerably over the past twelve months after sizable advances in earlier years. Excluding food and energy, core PCE prices decelerated over the past year; the July reading on the twelve-month change stood at 1.9 percent, almost 1/2 percentage point less than it was a year earlier. In my view, inflation expectations have been a key element in the recent performance of core inflation. By a range of measures, inflation expectations appear to have remained contained even as headline inflation moved temporarily higher. According to the Reuters/University of Michigan Survey of Consumers, the median expectation of inflation five to ten years ahead has been essentially flat since the beginning of last year. In addition, measures of long-run inflation compensation derived from spreads between yields on nominal and inflation-indexed Treasury securities have not pushed above the range that has prevailed in the past couple of years. As I discussed in a speech earlier this year, I read the evidence as suggesting that households' long-run inflation expectations are consistent with PCE price inflation in the neighborhood of 2 percent. To be sure, this figure is sensitive to the assumptions used to tease such estimates from the available data, so I do not want to overstate its precision. Still, the professional forecasters surveyed by the Philadelphia Fed also project PCE inflation to be close to 2 percent over the next five to ten years. As I look at the incoming inflation data, I would judge them to be consistent with expectations in this range; moreover, I believe that having expectations reasonably well anchored in this range has been a helpful influence on the path of actual inflation. However, let me be clear: I do not subscribe to a deus ex machina view of the inflation process, in which inflation is driven solely by inflation expectations and is little influenced by the balance of aggregate demand and aggregate supply. Indeed, I take the view that expectations of future resource utilization are also an important factor affecting inflation outcomes. If households and businesses believe that the Federal Reserve will set monetary policy in a way that keeps aggregate demand in reasonable alignment with aggregate supply over time, then expectations of future resource utilization will be stable, and current resource utilization will provide less information about future inflation movements. In that situation, which I believe describes the current environment, inflation expectations will be a key driver of inflation dynamics. The stable inflation expectations we have seen lately derive from confidence that monetary policy will keep inflation under control. If monetary policy allowed aggregate demand to get out of sync with supply and if the Fed was not expected to bring demand back into balance with supply, then inflation expectations would be much less likely to remain stable. This is why I believe that the Federal Reserve must remain vigilant on inflation but give appropriate attention to keeping demand from falling below supply as well. What does this all mean for the inflation outlook? At present, labor and product markets appear to be in reasonable balance. And I would expect the pressures on inflation that we have experienced from food and energy prices to abate. Accordingly, with inflation expectations remaining stable around their current level, I see inflation as remaining in alignment with long-run expectations at around a 2 percent pace for the PCE deflator. In addition, I believe that the risks to the inflation outlook have become more balanced, given the greater downside risks to real growth. Let me shift gears and discuss developments in financial markets. As you know, the recent turmoil had its beginnings in the subprime mortgage market. The development of the subprime market in the 1990s was an important financial innovation that enabled borrowers with higher credit risk to obtain mortgages that previously were unavailable to them. This expansion appears likely to have been a significant factor in raising the rate of homeownership from 64 percent, the level in 1994, to about 68 percent currently. In addition, subprime and other nonprime lending played an important role in the high volume of home sales in the mid-2000s. Indeed, data collected under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act indicate that about 25 percent of the loans used to purchase single-family, owner-occupied homes in 2005 were high-priced loans, including primarily subprime and some near-prime mortgages. However, as has been the case in previous instances of rapid financial innovations, adequate mechanisms to control excessive risk-taking may not have been in place during the subprime market's greatest growth. One innovation, further development of securitized products, gave mortgage lenders greater access to the capital markets and spread risks more broadly. However, securitization also widened the separation of the originators from the ultimate holders of the loans--that is, those who bought securities backed by loans. In this setup, a classic principal-agent problem can arise if originators (the agents) do not have a sufficient incentive to shield the owners of the securities (the principals) from suffering higher-than-expected losses. Against a backdrop of continued strong investor demand for high-yielding securities, some lenders began loosening underwriting standards for subprime mortgages in late 2005. Loans to subprime borrowers were approved with high loan-to-value ratios and incomplete income documentation. Had house prices kept appreciating, loan-to-value ratios would have fallen and some borrowers would have been able to refinance, perhaps into a prime loan with a lower interest rate. But, instead, as the housing market softened and interest rates rose, delinquencies in the adjustable-rate subprime market began to soar and reached nearly 15 percent in July. Among other types of nonprime mortgages, delinquencies on fixed-rate subprime mortgages have been fairly steady at less than 6 percent; rates on mortgages in alt-A pools have increased to nearly 3 percent, up notably from the 1 percent rate of only a year ago. The rise in delinquencies in the subprime market has led to the collapse of some large subprime lenders and inflicted substantial losses on holders of subprime residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) and of some collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). As a result, underwriting standards have been tightened, and fewer households are qualifying for subprime loans. In addition, some borrowers apart from the subprime segment are reportedly finding it more difficult to qualify for loans or are having to pay more for them. These developments have contributed materially to the drop in demand for housing this year. Without a doubt, they also have caused significant hardship for many individuals and families. Recently, we have watched the deterioration in financial conditions extend beyond the subprime market. Investors appear to have reassessed their outlook and their tolerance for risk, especially for structured financial products and for securities of highly leveraged firms. Bond spreads--especially those for speculative-grade debt--widened substantially in June and July, and the volatility of equity prices increased as well. In mid-August, following several events that led investors to believe that credit risks might be larger and more pervasive than previously thought, the functioning of financial markets, including short-term and interbank funding markets, became increasingly impaired. Notably, many asset-backed commercial paper programs found rolling over their paper increasingly difficult. To help restore orderly conditions, the Federal Reserve in recent weeks has increased the provision of reserves, cut the discount rate, and changed its usual discount-window lending practices in order to facilitate term borrowing, together with other measures. Stepping back from the rush of unfolding events, we are seeing a pattern that occurs from time to time. Financial markets and institutions perform the essential function of channeling funds to those individuals or firms having the most productive investment opportunities. However, an increase in uncertainty and concerns about the quality of information can lead investors to pull back from financial markets and restrict productive lending--with potentially adverse implications for real activity. That is essentially the story I laid out in a paper delivered at the Kansas City Fed's Jackson Hole conference about ten years ago. In my view, such an increase in uncertainty is an important part of what we have observed recently and stems from heightened concerns about the value of financial securities related to certain types of loans, about who is holding these securities, and about how a revaluation of these securities might affect the balance sheets of various financial intermediaries. Consequently, investors have become less willing to put funds into various financial markets, particularly into the more opaque segments of those markets. As best we can tell thus far, the imprint of these developments on economic activity appears likely to be most pronounced in the housing sector. However, economic activity could be affected more severely in other sectors should heightened uncertainty lead to a broader pullback in household and business spending. That scenario cannot, in my view, be ruled out, and I believe it poses an important downside risk to economic activity. I also believe that the process of adjustment that is under way in financial markets--of investors reassessing the outlook for risk and their tolerance for that risk--will ultimately create a more solid financial footing for the real economy. But in the meantime, the FOMC is monitoring the situation and is prepared to act as needed to mitigate the adverse effects on the economy arising from the disruptions in financial markets. Thank you for your interest and attention. I look forward to your questions and observations on recent developments. I would like to thank and for the excellent comments and assistance on this speech. Return to text , vol. 2007 (1), pp. 81-152.

6888,r071114a_FOMC,united states,2007-11-14,Federal Reserve Communications,bernanke,1,"The Federal Reserve, the central bank of the United States, provides the nation with a safe, flexible, and stable monetary and financial system. Montagu Norman, the Governor of the Bank of England from 1921 to 1944, reputedly took as his personal motto, ""Never explain, never excuse."" Norman's aphorism exemplified how he and many of his contemporaries viewed the making of monetary policy--as an arcane and esoteric art, best practiced out of public view. Many central bankers of Norman's time (and, indeed, well into the postwar period) believed that a certain mystique attached to their activities and that allowing the public a glimpse of the inner workings would only usurp the prerogatives of insiders and reduce, if not grievously damage, the effectiveness of policy. Norman's perspective on central banking now seems decidedly quaint. Over the past few decades, central banks around the world have worked assiduously to become more open about their activities. In fact, Norman's own institution, the Bank of England, has in recent years been a leading exponent of increased transparency in central banking. Monetary policy makers have adopted a range of methods to improve their communication with the public, including timely announcements of policy actions, expanded testimony before members of the legislature, the release of minutes of policy meetings, frequent public speeches, and the regular publication of reports about the economy and monetary policy. This increased openness is a welcome development for several reasons. Most importantly, monetary policy makers are public servants whose decisions affect the life of every citizen; consequently, in a democratic society, they have a responsibility to give the people and their elected representatives a full and compelling rationale for the decisions they make. Good communications are a prerequisite if central banks are to maintain the democratic legitimacy and independence that are essential to sound monetary policy making. In addition, a considerable amount of evidence indicates that central bank transparency increases the effectiveness of monetary policy and enhances economic and financial performance in several ways. First, improving the public's understanding of the central bank's objectives and policy strategies reduces economic and financial uncertainty and thereby allows businesses and households to make more-informed decisions. Second, if practitioners in financial markets gain a better understanding of how policy is likely to respond to incoming information, asset prices and bond yields will tend to respond to economic data in ways that further the central bank's policy objectives. For example, if market participants understand that arriving information about the economy increases the likelihood of certain policy actions, then market interest rates will tend to move in a way that reinforces the expected actions, effectively supporting the goals of the central bank. Third, clarity about the central bank's policy objectives and strategy may help anchor the public's long-term inflation expectations, which can substantially improve the efficacy of policy and the overall functioning of the economy. Finally, open discussion of the central bank's analyses and forecasts invites valuable input and feedback from the public. The benefits of an open and accountable policymaking process have spurred the Federal Reserve, along with other major central banks, to take a number of actions over the years to increase its transparency. Appropriately, given the unique position of the Federal Reserve and the sensitivity of financial markets to its communications, these steps have generally been incremental in nature; but, taken together, they have substantially increased the ability of the American public to understand and to anticipate monetary policy decisions. The Congress has also long been aware of the importance of Federal Reserve transparency and accountability; in particular, a series of resolutions and laws passed in the 1970s set clear policy objectives for the Federal Reserve and required it to provide regular reports and testimony to the Congress. Since 1975, the Federal Reserve has presented testimony twice each year to the Congress on the conduct of monetary policy. These semiannual presentations have become an important vehicle for the U.S. central bank to make known its views on the outlook and on the appropriate stance of policy. Other notable milestones in the Federal Reserve's progress toward greater openness include: in 1979, the first release of semiannual economic projections; in 1983, the first publication of the Beige Book, which summarizes information about economic conditions received from the Federal Reserve System's business contacts; in 1994, the decision to release a postmeeting statement when policy actions had been taken; in 2000, the beginning of the practice of issuing a statement after each meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and including in the statement an assessment of the balance of risks to the Committee's objectives; in 2002, adding the FOMC roll call vote to the postmeeting statement; and in 2005, the speeding up of the release of the minutes of FOMC meetings, from a delay of some six or seven weeks to just three weeks. In testimony to the Congress at the time of my nomination as Chairman, in 2005, I pledged to continue the trend toward greater openness sustained under Chairman Greenspan. In so doing, I stressed the importance of continuity with the policies and strategies that have served the American economy well. Any further changes, I promised, would come only pursuant to a consensus within the FOMC that those changes would enhance the Committee's ability to pursue its dual mandate of achieving maximum employment and price stability. Toward that end, the FOMC has engaged in extensive deliberations over the past year or so to consider further steps toward greater transparency. Guided by a subcommittee chaired by Board Vice Chairman Donald Kohn, the FOMC reviewed the full range of our communications with the public. As indicated in a statement issued by the FOMC today, these discussions have led to a decision to increase the frequency and expand the content of the publicly released economic projections that are made by Federal Reserve Board members and Reserve Bank presidents. As I mentioned, the Federal Reserve has published economic projections for almost thirty years, and, indeed, the Federal Reserve was the first major central bank to release such projections. Today's announcement builds on that foundation. In the remainder of my remarks I will describe the changes that we plan to make, and then explain why I believe that, collectively, they represent an important further step toward greater transparency. Because monetary policy affects spending and inflation with a lag, policy decisions must be based on an assessment of medium-term economic prospects. Thus, the Committee cannot fully explain its policy decisions without sharing its economic outlook with the public and the Congress. To provide more-timely information about the evolving outlook, the Federal Reserve will release FOMC participants' economic projections four times each year, rather than twice each year as we have done previously. Projections will continue to be released in February and July of each year to coincide with the semiannual Monetary Policy Report and the associated testimony to the Congress. Two additional sets of projections will be published in conjunction with the minutes of the FOMC meetings held around the beginnings of the second quarter and the fourth quarter of the year (in 2008, the April and October meetings). The first expanded set of projections will be released next week, on November 20, together with the minutes of the October FOMC meeting. The horizon of the projections will be extended from two years to three. The projections released next week will extend through 2010. Each of the participants in the FOMC meeting--including the Federal Reserve Board members and all the Reserve Bank presidents--will, as in the past, provide projections for the growth of real gross domestic product (GDP), the unemployment rate, and core inflation (that is, inflation excluding the prices of food and energy items). In addition, participants will now provide their projections for overall inflation. Both overall and core inflation will continue to be based on the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE). Projections will continue to be made independently by each FOMC participant under the assumption of ""appropriate"" monetary policy, that is, the future evolution of the federal funds rate judged by that participant to be the one most likely to foster economic outcomes that satisfy the Federal Reserve's dual mandate. Following past practice, we will publish the central tendency and the range of the projections for each variable and each year. We will also publish a comparison with the previous set of quarterly projections; a chart showing central tendencies and ranges for each variable; and charts showing the distribution of participants' projections and how that distribution has changed since the previous release. Accompanying the numerical projections will be a discussion--a projections ""narrative"" if you will--that summarizes participants' views of the major forces shaping the outlook, discusses the sources of risk to that outlook, and describes the dispersion of views among policymakers. By providing a medium-term perspective, the narrative will complement the discussion of shorter-term developments contained in the minutes. We will also provide qualitative information about participants' views on both the uncertainty and the balance of risks surrounding the outlook, together with quantitative historical information on the typical range of projection errors. Of course, the specific material provided and its form of presentation may change over time as we gain experience and receive feedback. The enhanced projections will provide the public with several types of useful information. In particular, I find it helpful to think of the projections as functioning in three different ways: as a forecast, as a provisional plan, and as an evaluation of certain long-run features of the economy. Most obviously, the projections reflect the economic forecasts of FOMC participants and as such should provide the public with greater and more-timely insight into the Committee's views of the economic outlook and the risks to that outlook. Of course, because our knowledge of the structure of the economy is incomplete and future economic disturbances are often unforeseeable, economic forecasting is a highly uncertain enterprise. The only economic forecast in which I have complete confidence is that the economy will not evolve along the precise path implied by our projections. Nevertheless, as I have already noted, because policy affects spending and inflation with a lag, Committee members have no choice other than to make medium-term forecasts--provisional and subject to uncertainty though they may be. Providing more information about these forecasts, including discussions of the factors underlying the forecasts and of FOMC participants' assessments of the risks to the Committee's objectives, should improve the public's understanding of the rationale for the current stance of monetary policy and any changes to that stance. The public will also be better able to judge the extent to which the Committee's rationale is reasonable and persuasive. The projections also function as a plan for policy--albeit as a rough and highly provisional one. As I mentioned earlier, FOMC participants will continue to base their projections on the assumption of ""appropriate"" monetary policy. Consequently, the extended projections will provide a sense of the economic trajectory that Committee participants see as best fulfilling the Federal Reserve's dual mandate, given the initial conditions and the constraints posed by the structure of the economy. To illustrate, consider the question of the length of time over which a central bank should aim to restore price stability following an unwanted increase in inflation. A central bank that places weight on both employment and price stability, like the Federal Reserve, would not attempt to disinflate immediately or establish a fixed time frame for the restoration of price stability. Rather, the optimal expected time required for completing the disinflation would depend on a host of factors, including the size of the initial deviation from price stability, the initial state of the real economy (for example, the level of unemployment), whether the rise in inflation resulted from transitory or more persistent sources, the extent to which inflation expectations are well anchored, and so on. In circumstances in which disinflationary policy is necessary, the extended economic projections would make clear that the Federal Reserve is committed to maintaining price stability, but they would also provide some indications about what the Committee views as the most appropriate pace of disinflation, given the state of the economy and the requirements of the dual mandate. In like fashion, the speed at which policy aims to return the economy to its sustainable rates of growth and employment following a period of resource slack should depend in part on the nature and extent of inflation risks, among other considerations. More generally, the extended projections will convey additional information about the Committee's policy strategies and thus help augment the Committee's transparency, predictability, and accountability. Finally, the extended projections will embody information about FOMC participants' evaluations of certain long-run features of the economy, evaluations determined both by the economy's structure and by the Committee's policy objectives. Because of the extension of the projection horizon to three years, participants' inflation projections will convey more information regarding their views about the measured rate of inflation that, in the long run, is consistent with the Committee's dual objectives of maximum employment and price stability. Were price stability the only objective mandated for the Federal Reserve, the FOMC presumably would strive to achieve zero inflation, properly measured--that is, the optimal measured inflation rate would deviate from zero on average only by the amount of the estimated measurement error in the preferred inflation index. But under the Federal Reserve's dual mandate, the determination of the appropriate long-run inflation rate must take account of factors that may affect the efficient functioning of the economy at very low rates of inflation, such as the risk that the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates might hinder the effectiveness of monetary policy. Thus, the (properly measured) long-run inflation rate that best promotes the dual mandate is likely to be low but not zero. Ultimately, households and businesses care about the overall, or ""headline,"" rate of inflation; therefore, the FOMC should refer to an overall inflation rate when evaluating whether the Committee has met its mandated objectives over the long run. For that reason, the Committee has decided to publish projections for overall inflation as well as core inflation. In its policy statements and elsewhere, the Committee makes frequent reference to core inflation because, in light of the volatility of food and energy prices, core inflation can be a useful short-run indicator of the underlying trend in inflation. However, at longer horizons, where monetary policy has the greatest control over inflation, the overall inflation rate is the appropriate gauge of whether inflation is at a rate consistent with the dual mandate. FOMC participants will continue to couch their inflation projections in terms of PCE inflation, rather than, say, inflation as measured by the consumer price index, because the PCE index is generally thought to provide the single most comprehensive and theoretically compelling measure of consumer prices. That said, no single measure of inflation is perfect, and the Committee will continue to monitor a range of measures when forming its view about inflation prospects. The lengthening of the projection horizon will also allow the public to infer more about FOMC participants' current judgments about the rate of GDP growth and the unemployment rate that the economy can sustain in the long run. Over time, effective monetary policies foster rates of growth and unemployment close to their long-run sustainable rates. However, in contrast to inflation, which in the long run is determined by monetary policy, the rates of economic growth and unemployment that can be sustained in the long run are determined by many factors outside the control of central banks. Among these factors are the advance of technology, entrepreneurial activities, the growth in the size of the labor force, the rate at which workers acquire new skills, tax and regulatory policies, and the efficiency of labor markets in matching workers with positions. Consequently, the long-run sustainable rates of economic growth and unemployment should be viewed as constraints on what monetary policy can achieve and not as variables that policymakers can freely choose. In addition, estimates of sustainable rates of growth and unemployment have been shown to be highly uncertain at any point in time; and they may vary significantly over time in light of new information and changes in the structure of the economy. Thus, the longer-run projections of growth and unemployment should be treated with considerable caution. As you may know, I have been an advocate of the monetary policy strategy known as inflation targeting, used in many countries around the world. Inflation targeting is characterized by two features: an explicit numerical target or target range for inflation and a high degree of transparency about forecasts and policy plans. The steps being taken by the Federal Reserve, I must emphasize, are intended only to improve our communication with the public; the conduct of policy itself will not change. Nonetheless, in light of the changes to communications we are undertaking, one might fairly ask how the Federal Reserve's approach relates to inflation targeting. A superficial drawback of inflation targeting is its very name, which suggests a single-minded focus on inflation to the exclusion of other goals. In fact, the practice of monetary policy in an inflation-targeting regime is not necessarily inconsistent with a dual mandate such as that given to the Federal Reserve; indeed, most if not all inflation-targeting central banks today practice ""flexible"" inflation targeting, meaning that they take account of other economic goals besides price stability--notably economic growth, employment, and financial stability--when making policy decisions. Moreover, a broad consensus exists among central banks, whether they have an explicit numerical target for inflation or not, that maintaining low and stable inflation over time is the best means by which monetary policy can promote economic efficiency and maximize the nation's economic welfare. Thus, at least since the stabilization of U.S. inflation in the 1980s, the Federal Reserve's approach to monetary policy has had much in common with that of central banks that describe themselves as inflation targeters. Nevertheless, some aspects of inflation targeting may be less well suited to the Federal Reserve's mandate and policy practice. In particular, although inflation-targeting central banks certainly pay attention to economic growth and employment, their formal accountability is often largely couched only in terms of a price-stability objective. Likewise, the communication strategies of inflation-targeting central banks tend to be focused on the formal inflation objective and the horizon over which that objective will be achieved. As I have emphasized today, the Federal Reserve is legally accountable to the Congress for two objectives, maximum employment and price stability, on an equal footing. My colleagues and I strongly support the dual mandate and the equal weighting of objectives that it implies. Of course, as I have discussed, the Federal Reserve's influence over these objectives differs importantly in the long run: Monetary policy determines the long-run inflation rate, whereas the factors that influence the sustainable rates of growth and employment in the long run are largely outside the central bank's control. Still, over time, monetary policy must strive to foster rates of growth and employment close to their long-run sustainable rates. The Federal Reserve must thus be accountable for the effects of its policies on the real economy as well as on inflation. The enhanced projections that I have described today will provide additional information pertinent to both halves of the Federal Reserve's mandate. At a more technical level, the Federal Reserve differs from most inflation-targeting central banks in that it provides information about the independent projections of Committee members rather than a single collective forecast. To some extent, that difference reflects the relatively large size of the FOMC and the geographic dispersion of Committee participants; those factors would make the development of a detailed consensus forecast quite difficult as a practical matter. But, as I will discuss briefly, such a diversity of viewpoints can enhance the quality of policy decisions. An important strength of the Federal Open Market Committee is its diversity. The Board members and Reserve Bank presidents who sit around the table at each meeting of the FOMC bring a wide range of perspectives to the deliberations that reflect the participants' professional backgrounds, the regions of the country with which they are most familiar, and their differing approaches to economic and policy analysis. The task participants face at each meeting is to forge a rough consensus regarding the outlook, the risks to the Committee's objectives, and the appropriate policy response. Of course, it is not always possible--indeed, it would be rather unusual--to come to a set of conclusions that fully represent the views of every participant. But the process of searching for common ground is itself an important aspect of how the Committee operates. Diversity of views drives the Committee to adopt an eclectic approach and thus serves to limit the risk that a single viewpoint or analytical framework might become unduly dominant. The changes to the projections process announced today preserve the important role played by this diversity of perspectives. As I have noted, Committee participants will continue to produce individual projections that reflect their judgments about the state of the economy and their approaches to policy. From the internal perspective, I expect the more frequent sharing of projections and the additional information they contain will improve our discussions and policy debates. From the external perspective, the public will gain additional and more frequent information about both the central tendencies and diversity of participants' views. In particular, the additional narrative material that will accompany the numerical projections will illuminate both the consensus of opinion and the differences in judgments that may emerge. The communications strategy of the Federal Reserve is a work in progress. I believe that the changes announced by the FOMC today are an important advance: The changes will provide a more-timely insight into the Committee's outlook, will help households and businesses better understand and anticipate how our policy decisions respond to incoming information, and will enhance our accountability for the decisions we make. But the changes are also evolutionary, in that they build on long-established practices; in that respect, they represent just one more step on the road toward greater transparency at the Federal Reserve. The Committee will continue to look for ways to improve the accountability and public understanding of U.S. monetary policy making.

7014,r091110a_FOMC,united states,2009-11-10,Supervising and Resolving Large Financial Institutions,tarullo,0,"The Federal Reserve, the central bank of the United States, provides the nation with a safe, flexible, and stable monetary and financial system. Proposals for the creation of a special resolution process for large financial firms have rightly assumed prominence in the wake of the financial crisis. Some events during the crisis have also focused attention on the difficult problems often created by the failure of a large, internationally active financial firm. In my remarks this afternoon I want to elaborate a bit on the relationship between resolution processes and an effective overall system of financial regulation and supervision in both the international and domestic spheres. At the risk of some oversimplification, I would state that relationship as follows: First, an effective domestic resolution process is a necessary complement to supervision that would bring more market discipline into the decisionmaking of large financial firms, their counterparties, and investors. Second, the high legal and political hurdles to harmonized cross-border resolution processes suggest that, for the foreseeable future, the effectiveness of those processes will largely depend on supervisory requirements and cooperation undertaken before distress appears on the horizon. I would further suggest that the importance of proposed requirements that each large financial firm produce a so-called living will is that this device could better tie the supervisory and resolution processes together. During the financial crisis, serious distress at a large financial firm presented authorities in the United States and many other countries with only two realistic alternatives. First, they could try to contain systemic risk by stabilizing the firm through capital injections, extraordinary liquidity assistance, or both. Second, they could allow the firm to fail and enter generally applicable bankruptcy processes. Faced with the possibility of a cascading financial crisis, most governments selected the bailout option in most cases. Yet this option obviously risks imposing significant costs on the taxpayer and supports the notion that some firms are too-big-to-fail, with consequent negative effects on market discipline and competitive equality among financial institutions of different sizes. Indeed, too-big-to-fail perceptions undermine normal regulatory and supervisory requirements. However, as the Lehman Brothers experience demonstrated, permitting the disorderly failure of a large, interconnected firm can indeed unleash just the systemic consequences that motivated the bailouts. The desirability of a third alternative is thus obvious--a special resolution process that would allow the government to wind down a systemically important firm in an orderly way. As compelling as the case for such a process is, the debate around resolution proposals has shown how challenging it is to craft a workable resolution regime for large, interconnected firms that will effectively advance the complementary--but at times competing--goals of financial stability and market discipline. Still, I think there are certain key features that are essential. First, any new regime should be used only in those rare circumstances where a firm's failure would have serious adverse effects on financial stability. That is, the presumption should be that generally applicable bankruptcy law applies to non-bank financial firms. One way to help ensure that the regime is invoked only when necessary to protect the public's interest in systemic stability is to use a ""multi-key"" approach--that is, one that requires the approval of multiple agencies and a determination by each that the high standards governing the use of the special regime have been met. Once invoked, however, the government should have broad authority to restructure or wind down the company in an orderly way. This authority should include--among other things--selling assets, liabilities, or business units of the firm, transferring the systemically significant operations of the firm to a new bridge entity that can continue these operations, and repudiating burdensome contracts of the firm, subject to appropriate compensation. Second, there should be a clear expectation that the shareholders and creditors of the failing firm will bear losses to the fullest extent consistent with preserving financial stability. Shareholders of the firm ultimately are responsible for the organization's management (or, more likely, mismanagement) and are supposed to be in a first-loss position upon failure of the firm. Shareholders, therefore, should pay the price for the firm's failure and should not benefit from any rehabilitation of the firm through a government-managed resolution process. To promote market discipline on the part of the creditors of large, interconnected firms, unsecured creditors of the firm should also bear losses, although the extent of these losses and the manner in which they are applied likely would need to depend on the facts of the individual case. Third, the ultimate cost of any government assistance provided in the course of the resolution process to prevent severe disruptions to the financial system should be borne by the firm or the financial services industry, not by taxpayers. The scope of financial institutions assessed for these purposes should be appropriately broad, reflective of the fact that a wide range of financial institutions likely would benefit, directly or indirectly, from actions that avoid or mitigate threats to financial stability. However, because the largest and most interconnected firms likely would benefit the most, it seems appropriate that these firms should bear a proportionally larger share of any costs that cannot be recouped from the failing firm itself. To avoid pro-cyclical effects such assessments should be collected over an extended period. The looming or actual failure of a large, internationally active financial firm inevitably complicates the already challenging process of resolution. Mismatches in the amount and maturities of assets and liabilities held by the firm in the various countries in which it operates can lead host governments to take special action to protect the interests of depositors and creditors. Different insolvency regimes apply to separately incorporated subsidiaries across the world. Some of those regimes may be substantively inconsistent with one another, or may not account for the special characteristics of a large international firm. A natural response, which one can find peppered through various law journals over the years, is to propose an international treaty that would establish and harmonize appropriate insolvency regimes throughout the world. Just to state the proposition is to see the enormous hurdles to its realization. The task of harmonizing divergent legal regimes, and reconciling the principles underlying many of these regimes, would be challenge enough. But an effective international regime would also likely require agreement on how to share the losses and possible special assistance associated with a global firm's insolvency. Despite the good and thorough work being undertaken in both the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and the Financial Stability Board, we must acknowledge that satisfyingly clean and comprehensive solutions to the international difficulties occasioned by such insolvencies are not within sight. It would certainly be useful if jurisdictions could at least broadly synchronize both standard bankruptcy and any special resolution procedures applicable to a failing financial firm. But even this significant advance would not settle many of the nettlesome problems raised by a cross-border insolvency. It thus seems reasonably clear that effective management of these problems will, at least for the foreseeable future, require regulatory coordination and supervisory cooperation before a large firm's failure becomes a real possibility. In one sense, this observation reinforces the importance of the international agenda for strengthening capital and liquidity standards. It also counsels continued attention to efforts to ensure that globally active institutions are subject to effective consolidated supervision, and that information-sharing arrangements among home and host country supervisors are well designed and implemented. To this end, the key supervisors and central banks for each of the largest global banks will begin to meet regularly to discuss crisis planning, with particular attention to contingency liquidity planning. The crisis demonstrated that issues around cross-border liquidity support are difficult. Liquidity pressures may arise in unexpected places; time for coordination will be short; and failures in one jurisdiction likely will spread quickly to other jurisdictions. The Basel Committee and the Committee of European Banking Supervisors are working on definitions of liquid assets, common stress testing metrics and structural balance sheet measures. We are actively discussing the appropriate division of responsibility between home and host authorities to provide liquidity support and the related issue of how to approach cross-border branch operations. Some have called into question the traditional assumption that home country authorities will be willing and able to support all of the worldwide operations of a banking group headquartered in its jurisdiction. What approach to substitute remains unclear, however, beyond the obvious need for broad international consistency and careful calibration with other prudential requirements. One of the key issues identified by the Basel Committee's Cross-border Bank Resolution Group is the complexity and interconnectedness of the largest organizations. Often the complexity is motivated by tax or regulatory factors, rather than a clear business purpose. Given the way these firms are structured and their linkages to key systems and other institutions, resolution of such an organization will carry significant risk of spillovers to other key markets, payments systems, or systemically important institutions. The Cross-border Bank Resolution Group consequently recommended developing initiatives that would result in simpler, less connected structures. This point leads us to one much-discussed idea, that of firm-specific resolution plans--sometimes referred to more colorfully, though not wholly accurately, as living wills. In one variant of the idea, each internationally active bank would be required to develop, and potentially to execute, its own resolution plan--literally to plan for its own demise. Such a requirement could doubtless be helpful to some degree, but it has notable limitations. Most obviously, it is very difficult to predict in advance of a crisis which parts of the firm will be under greatest stress, what geographical regions may be affected most severely, and what the condition in various markets and economies will be, as well as the stability of counterparties and similarly situated institutions. Furthermore, governments may be understandably reluctant to rely too much upon a wind-down plan developed by an internationally active financial firm that so mismanaged itself that it is on the brink of failure, placing other institutions at peril. Finally, management of an institution can be expected to seek to preserve as much value for shareholders as possible in its planning, whereas the supervisors' objective in a crisis is to achieve an orderly resolution, which will often entail winding down or restructuring the insolvent firm in ways that effectively wipe out shareholder interests. The living will requirement could be broadened so as to make it into a potentially very useful supervisory tool for healthy firms, as well as a resource in the event that resolution became necessary. Under this approach, the firm would, in addition to developing a resolution plan, be required to draw up a contingency plan to rescue itself short of failure, identify obstacles to an orderly resolution, and quickly produce the information needed for the supervisor to orchestrate an orderly resolution. These plans will need to evolve as the organization's business and economic conditions evolve and will need to become a regular part of normal supervisory processes. A living will of this type could remove some of the uncertainty around a possible resolution. It would force firms and their supervisors to review contingency plans regularly. As part of their ongoing oversight, supervisors could target the areas where a firm's planning falls short of best practice. Indeed, by focusing on the legal, contractual, and business relationships among the firm's subsidiaries, this requirement could yield significant benefits for prudential supervision in normal times, quite apart from its benefits in a stressed environment. Central to the success of a living will as a supervisory tool is the quality of information it would make available in a crisis. Some of the information would be relatively static. A firm would have to inventory all its legal entities, along with the legal regimes applicable to each one, and map its business lines into legal entities. A firm also would have to document interaffiliate guarantees, funding, hedging, and provision of information technology and other key services. This information would be needed to deal with any crisis, no matter what its specific form. Supervisory discussions will be essential to determine the scope and nature of the rapidly changing information that would be needed under each firm's living will. It can be expected to include matters such as credit exposures, funding, unpledged collateral and available lines of credit, cash flows, earnings, capital, and so forth--all coded by identifiers such as business line, legal entity, counterparty, and legal jurisdiction to allow for the ready retrieval of critical information needed depending on the nature, location, and type of stress. Much of this information can change monthly, daily, or even intraday. Once the centrality of accurate, comprehensive information is understood, it becomes apparent that a very significant upgrade of management information systems (MIS) may be the only way for the firm to satisfy living will requirements. Improved MIS are also needed for ongoing risk management at the institution. One of the lessons of the recent crisis is that many firms had inadequate information systems to measure and manage their risks. Improvements in automated MIS capacity will likely involve considerable expense. Again, though, the result will be improvements in risk management that will help avoid a crisis at the firm, as well as to manage such a crisis successfully should it nonetheless occur. Supervisory demands for improved MIS could have another benefit. Just as a homeowner has an incentive to shed belongings to reduce the expense of moving, so a financial firm may have a powerful incentive to simplify its organizational structure and rationalize relationships among its corporate entities in order to reduce the cost of developing comprehensive MIS that enables an organization to retrieve information in multiple formats across jurisdictions, business lines, and legal entities. Simpler structures can also be encouraged by re-emphasizing existing supervisory guidance requiring banking organizations to measure and manage their risks not only on the global, consolidated level, but also on a legal entity basis. Together, the information requirements of living wills and the need to measure and manage risks at the legal entity level can help create the right incentives for firms to simplify their structures without necessarily requiring a supervisor to delve into the details of a banking group's structure. All the work on resolution, both domestically and internationally, is important and necessary. But we must be realistic about what it can accomplish. In light of what has happened over the past 18 months, it is imperative that governments convince markets that they can and will put large financial firms into a resolution process rather than bail out its creditors and shareholders. Yet no one can guarantee that future resolutions of systemically important firms will proceed smoothly or predictably. Resolution mechanisms must be understood not as silver bullets, but as critical pieces of a broader agenda directed at the too-big-to-fail problem. Measures such as strengthening capital standards and bringing all systemically important firms within the perimeter of regulation are other essential elements of that agenda. The views expressed are my own and not necessarily those of other members of the Board of Governors.

7095,r110429a_FOMC,united states,2011-04-29,Community Development in Challenging Times,bernanke,1,"As always, I'm pleased to join you at the Federal Reserve's biennial Community Affairs Research Conference. This meeting brings together researchers, community development professionals, and public-sector officials to explore how best to strengthen struggling communities. Needless to say, that endeavor is more crucial than ever. The past few years have been very difficult. Weak economic conditions at the national level have translated into hardships in many communities at the same time that communities have fewer resources available for stabilization and revitalization. Considerable good work is going on nonetheless, and I will offer a few examples of that today. At the national level, the economy is recovering at a moderate pace. In particular, the labor market has been gradually improving and the unemployment rate has declined somewhat. But unemployment remains quite high, particularly among minorities, the young, and those with less education. What's more, long-term unemployment remains at historically high levels. Nearly half of the unemployed have been out of work for six months or more. The housing market is also holding back the recovery. The foreclosure rate remains very high, and many homeowners who have avoided foreclosure find themselves ""under water,"" meaning their mortgage debt exceeds the value of their homes. Obviously, the problems in the labor market and the housing market are not unrelated. In particular, lost income from unemployment is causing many families to fall behind on their mortgage payments. As families have struggled, so have their communities. In some areas, for example, high foreclosure rates have produced significant numbers of vacant properties, depressing surrounding home prices, attracting crime, and creating financial burdens for  local governments. Thus, some community development groups now are simply trying to hold onto past progress that they have made in building up the physical infrastructure and human capital of their communities, while others have lost ground and are beginning the process of rebuilding. While the scale of the problems has been exceptional, many of the problems themselves are not new for lower-income families and communities that were already struggling. People who were vulnerable to begin with--those with low incomes, few assets, and less education--have had a more difficult time weathering the financial storm or recovering from setbacks. The same is true for communities that were already relatively poor, with fewer community assets and insufficient drivers of economic growth. To solve problems, we must first understand them. Like many of you here today, the Federal Reserve has been engaged for some time in research and analysis of the economic challenges faced by neighborhoods and communities as well as by individuals and families. For example, in 2008, the Federal Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors, in partnership with the Brookings Institution, published a study of the effects of concentrated poverty on communities. The communities studied included older inner cities in the North, smaller cities in the South and West, Native American reservations, ""gateway"" neighborhoods that are entry points for immigrants, and rural areas in Appalachia and the Mississippi Delta. What these diverse communities had in common was that they did not share in our country's general prosperity, even in good times. Our  research identified some of the barriers to economic progress shared by these communities, including inadequate schools and workforce skills, lack of investment in infrastructure and business development, and limited institutional capacity. Not surprisingly, these communities were particularly ill-equipped to deal with the recession. Of course, economic conditions in a given community both affect and are affected by the economic status of the individuals and families in that community. One of the most valuable sources of data on family finances is the Federal Reserve Board's triennial To better understand the effects of the crisis on households, the Board, in a special update to its 2007 survey, asked the participants about their financial and personal circumstances two years later, in 2009. The findings help illustrate the challenges facing families and communities. According to this special survey, lower-income households continued to experience significantly more unemployment than higher-income households. In 2009, nearly one-fourth of the families in the bottom half of the income distribution had at least one member who was out of work for some portion of the year prior to the survey; this rate was about double that of higher-income households. Declines in the values of homes and stocks sharply reduced the wealth of many Americans during the crisis. Three-fifths or more of families across all income groups reported a decline in wealth between 2007 and 2009, and the typical household lost nearly one-fifth of its wealth, regardless of income group. Moreover, one in eight of the  households in the panel started the crisis with zero or negative net worth and thus had scant resources to fall back on to maintain their standard of living during bouts of unemployment. Unemployment and declines in wealth obviously can make it difficult for a household to pay its debts on time. The survey update found that lower-income households fell behind on their payments at a substantially higher rate than higher- income households. Among households with debt, about 11 percent of those with incomes in the bottom half of the income distribution fell 60 days or more behind on at least one of their obligations in 2009, compared with nearly 3 percent of those in the highest tenth of the income distribution. Just as lower-income households weather financial storms with more difficulty, the same is true of communities. Even before the crisis, some neighborhoods, towns, and cities were in distress. Those areas already lacked sufficient assets such as strong public schools and community facilities, and rising unemployment and falling tax revenues reduced the funds available for public services even as needs increased. Often, residents were disproportionately unbanked or underbanked and relied on expensive alternative financial service providers. In communities with already low housing values--due, for instance, to oversupply caused by population shifts--the wave of foreclosures that began in 2007 sent the number of vacant properties soaring, causing additional problems. In short, the financial crisis and recession touched many families and communities. But those that were struggling before the crisis were often disproportionately affected.  Responding to the Challenges The challenges for those working to address the many evident problems in troubled communities can be daunting. When so many social and economic problems are interconnected--high unemployment, foreclosures, crime, loss of tax revenues and social services, lack of economic opportunity--deciding where to start to improve the situation can be quite difficult. Certainly no single program or approach will address all of the problems. But realistically, we have to pick places to begin, with the expectation that finding solutions in one area will confer wider benefits. For example, providing responsible credit for individuals and small businesses through community development financial institutions can stimulate economic activity that generates local tax revenues. Those tax revenues can be spent on programs to put vacant properties back into active use, helping to reduce crime, or on job training or economic development programs, leading to more employment and wage income that can help homeowners avoid foreclosures. As the Board's eyes and ears around the country, the Federal Reserve Banks have kept us well informed of the variety of ways local communities are meeting the challenges of tough times in troubled communities. Though the following is only a small sampling of the work going on around the country, I'd like to share a few of these stories with the hope that one community's success may lead others to emulate it. In Massachusetts, for example, a community development financial institution called Boston Community Capital is pursuing an innovative strategy to prevent occupied homes from becoming vacant and creating a strain on the community. Through special financing entities, it buys foreclosed-upon but still occupied homes from lenders at  market value. The initiative, dubbed Stabilizing Urban Neighborhoods, or SUN, is focused on six low-income neighborhoods in Boston that have the city's highest concentration of foreclosures. Taking advantage of the diminished home values, the group buys the properties and then resells them at affordable prices to existing occupants--both owners and tenants--who can demonstrate that they have suffered hardship. This program prevents properties from becoming vacant and provides families with a sustainable and affordable housing situation; it is designed to start small and expand as needed. In the South, ACCION Texas-Louisiana, a nonprofit organization, has been focused on assisting entrepreneurs start small businesses and helping existing small businesses to expand. ACCION lends to entrepreneurs whose businesses are too small or too new to qualify for a regular bank loan. Minority-owned businesses receive more than 80 percent of its loans, and almost half of the lending goes to women-owned businesses. Since 2009, the organization has expanded from Texas into Louisiana to respond to small businesses affected by Hurricane Katrina. The recession put extra pressure on ACCION, as existing borrowers were having increasing trouble paying back their loans. At the same time, demand for its services increased, as newly laid-off workers were seeking loans to start their own businesses. The organization responded by expanding its services--opening a business support center and business incubators, providing more comprehensive technical assistance, developing new business partnerships, reaching into new markets, and strengthening its underwriting platform to reduce waiting time for applicants and reduce its own costs.  In my home state of South Carolina, as in many parts of the country, the effects of the crisis varies from community to community. For instance, the city of Charleston, a popular tourist destination known for its historic architecture and fine cuisine, is faring relatively well overall. Even so, both unemployment and poverty in the greater Charleston area increased significantly between 2007 and 2009. Median income in the nearby city of North Charleston, which has struggled ever since a naval base closed in 1996, is about three-fourths that of Charleston. In some older neighborhoods, families have moved out, leaving behind many vacant properties. Some parts of the metropolitan area are experiencing economic growth, but the benefits of that growth do not reach all communities. While some major corporations have expanded into the area, inadequate education and training, as well as the lack of public transportation, make it difficult for many residents of low-income and minority communities to take advantage of new jobs. Local development groups have been working to ameliorate the situation. For example, Metanoia CDC, a community development corporation, is located in the heart of the old naval communities of North Charleston, and its work has visibly improved the hardest hit communities. Its holistic range of programs--in community leadership, quality affordable housing, and economic development--appears to be contributing to decreasing crime, rising student grades, and homes for first-time homebuyers. The group focuses on building assets--both physical and human--such as transforming vacant buildings into  homes for families and helping students in a Young Leaders program improve their performance in school. In the San Joaquin Valley of California, the unemployment rate hovers around 18 percent. In 2009, in response to the ongoing foreclosure crisis, nonprofit agencies; local, state, and federal agencies; academics; real estate professionals; financial institutions; small business and workforce development professionals; and loan servicers coordinate efforts on a regional scale to avoid preventable foreclosures. This work continues, and the group is now expanding its efforts to also help families that have already gone through a foreclosure. This year, the task force is beginning a series of foreclosure recovery workshops across the valley. Families will learn about local programs and assistance, including job training and employment assistance. Credit counselors will help them begin repairing their damaged credit. And, in cases in which they may be victims of fraud, they will receive guidance and referrals to legal aid attorneys. As a final example, in Cleveland, local leaders in the Slavic Village neighborhood have been dealing with some of the highest foreclosure rates in the nation since the 1990s. Cleveland saw population loss for five successive decades, resulting in an oversupply of housing. With the onset of the financial crisis, the problem began to worsen dramatically. By 2007, Slavic Village was the Zip code with the highest number of foreclosures in the nation. By 2010, more than 1,500 properties in a neighborhood of 11,000 homes needed to be demolished. This community has a history of strong neighborhood organizations, and as might be expected, its residents, community leaders,  nonprofits, local governments, and companies stepped up their efforts. In one partnership, community groups are using data provided by a local university to identify borrowers at risk of foreclosure and are reaching out to them, door to door, to see what might be done to prevent a foreclosure. In another example, residents and community leaders in Slavic Village alerted county prosecutors to fraudulent lending in the neighborhood. As the crisis continues to play out, community leaders have found ways to reuse vacant land, adding gardens, yard expansions, and bike trails among the neighborhood's declining number of homes, making it safer and more attractive. Business leaders are helping as well by purchasing and demolishing properties adjacent to the gardens and trails and supporting the renovation and expansion of a nearby school and recreation center. I have cited just a few examples of work that is making a difference at the grass- roots level all around the country. They show that, though the challenges in troubled communities are indeed daunting, we are far from helpless, and much good work is being accomplished. For our part, we at the Federal Reserve will remain closely attuned to the economic health of all communities, including low- and moderate-income communities. Each of our Federal Reserve Banks works with local leaders and community groups to provide relevant research, data, and support, with the Board backing up these efforts across the country. The broader economy is in a moderate recovery, and we have recently seen some welcome, if gradual, improvement in the labor market. But our economy is far from where we would like it to be, and many people and neighborhoods are in danger of being  left behind. The work of community groups, local leaders and businesses, and others is a critical component to a national economic recovery. In addition to our work in regulating banks and in conducting monetary policy so as to achieve maximum employment with price stability, the Federal Reserve will continue to assist these efforts through local community outreach, by using its convening power, and through research like that being discussed at this conference. If we work together, I believe we can find effective ways to repair the damage done by the crisis to the economic prospects of families and communities. Until vulnerable families and troubled communities have regained lost progress, the economic recovery will remain incomplete.","['recession', 'unemployed', 'unemployment', 'rebuilding', 'prosperity']","['communities struggling', 'struggling communities', 'economy recovering', 'communities crisis', 'economic recovery']","['strengthen struggling communities', 'communities struggling crisis', 'communities struggling people', 'gradually improving unemployment', 'challenges troubled communities']"
7265,r150218a_FOMC,united states,2015-02-18,"Financial Institutions, Financial Markets, and Financial Stability",powell,1,"It has now been over six years since the most acute phase of the financial crisis. Over the intervening years, market structures have evolved, and financial firms have changed their business models in important respects. Authorities around the world are implementing reforms that address the painful lessons of the crisis, while at the same time keeping the evolution of markets and firms in mind. Today, I will briefly summarize this sweeping reform program as it relates to large, global systemically important banks (G-SIBs), critical financial market infrastructure, and money markets. In my view, the basic agendas in these areas are, to different degrees, well developed, although a great deal of implementation remains. In contrast, I will argue that thinking about financial stability in the context of credit markets is less advanced and presents difficult challenges for supervisors. I will consider a range of factors that may address those challenges, illustrated with a discussion of recent developments in the syndicated leveraged loan market. And I will argue that the standard for regulatory intervention in the credit markets should be higher than for the other three areas. before the financial crisis ended, it was clear that reforms to strengthen the most systemically important firms and their regulation and supervision needed to be the first order of business. I will mention four critical elements of that program. First, these institutions are required to hold, and now do hold, much higher levels of higher-quality capital, as measured by both risk-based ratios and a much more comprehensive leverage ratio. Under the ""enhanced prudential standards"" of the  phased-in capital requirements will be meaningfully higher for these institutions because of the greater threat their failure would pose to the financial system and to the broader economy. Second, these institutions are for the first time becoming subject to rule-based Ratio, and liquidity stress testing. These innovations are in part designed to address the firms' vulnerabilities to damaging runs on their short-term financing, runs that occurred repeatedly during the crisis and clearly increased its severity. Third, we now have rigorous, forward-looking capital stress testing that recognizes the dynamic nature of the financial system and guards against the excessive optimism that can build during a credit boom. These three reforms are well advanced and, in my view, have left the G-SIBs far stronger than they were before the crisis. Together, they significantly reduce the probability of a large bank failure. But they would leave us short of meeting the overriding objective of eliminating the too-big-to-fail conundrum without a fourth reform--a viable resolution mechanism that could handle the failure of these institutions without severe damage to the economy. Until recently, no nation has had a way of handling such failures without that degree of damage. Authorities around the world have been working to develop an approach to resolving large financial firms that credibly imposes losses on shareholders and debt holders consistent with the basic tenets of our capitalist system, but does so in a way that protects the rest of the financial system and the real economy from severe damage. The  single-point-of-entry approach developed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in conjunction with other U.S. supervisors is a promising innovation, especially in combination with the recent proposal of the Financial Stability Board to increase the ""total loss absorbency capacity"" of systemically important firms in terms of their total levels of equity and long-term debt. When fully worked out, these new regulatory regimes should permit a large, consolidated entity that owns banks or broker-dealers to continue to function even if the ultimate holding company ceases to be viable and must be recapitalized or wound down. As I said at the outset, these reforms directed at the G-SIBs are well advanced. But much implementation remains, including, most notably, addressing cross-border issues associated with the failure of complex global firms. It will take time and continued international cooperation to complete this task. The crisis exposed a number of important weaknesses in the infrastructure of the financial markets--what might be more plainly called the plumbing. Reforms aimed at addressing these weaknesses receive less public attention than those focused on the G-SIBs, and are in some respects less advanced in their conception and execution. But they are, in my view, of great importance. I will mention two important sets of reforms in the U.S. context, one well advanced and the other still under development. The first concerns the triparty repurchase agreement (repo) market, which is a principal source of overnight financing  for the largest securities dealers. Before the crisis, the functioning of this market was critically dependent on the extension of large volumes of discretionary intraday credit by two clearing banks. When confidence in Bear Stearns collapsed in March 2008, the vulnerability of this market and its settlement procedures in particular became very clear. Today, almost seven years later, in no small measure thanks to the leadership and persistence of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the triparty repo settlement process has been substantially reengineered, with reliance on discretionary intraday credit essentially eliminated. In addition, a smaller fraction of the market now involves the financing of lower-quality collateral, and far less of the overall funding is provided overnight and thus subject to daily rollover risk. Dealers in general manage their short- term funding risk far more conservatively than before the crisis, including by carrying substantially higher levels of liquidity, in part because of the introduction of prudential liquidity standards that I mentioned earlier. Second, as I have discussed at some length in other venues, in the run-up to the crisis, the highly opaque and fast-growing market for over-the-counter derivatives gave rise to an underappreciated and largely invisible buildup of risk, which proved a major source of instability when the crisis broke. In light of this experience, authorities around  the world agreed in 2009 that standardized derivatives should be cleared through central counterparties (CCPs), and that noncentrally cleared derivatives should be subject to minimum margin requirements. Central clearing holds the promise of enhancing financial stability through the netting of counterparty risks, creating greater transparency, and applying stronger and more consistent risk-management practices. But this reform program will only succeed if CCPs, in which counterparty credit risks are concentrated, are strong enough to withstand severe but plausible stress scenarios, including, for example, the failure of multiple clearing members. Achieving this degree of resiliency will require robust liquidity risk- management practices, including the maintenance of substantial buffers of liquid resources that can quickly be tapped. In addition, adequate loss absorption capacity is essential, including through substantial initial margin requirements and default funds. A framework for such requirements has been agreed upon at the international level through Vigorous implementation at the national level is essential. There is also a need for greater transparency for clearing members and the public regarding the risk-management practices of CCPs, for heightened stress testing, for consideration of ""skin-in-the-game"" requirements, and for credible recovery and resolution plans. A great deal of work remains to be done to finalize and implement these additional reforms in all of the important CCPs around the world.  Money markets involve money-like investments such as commercial paper and repo. Investors in these markets include money market funds, corporations and other large holders of excess cash seeking a safe return in the short term, frequently no longer than overnight. Borrowers in money markets include banks, securities dealers and other financial companies, nonfinancial corporations, and governments. By linking investors seeking a safe return with borrowers needing short- term credit, money markets do what commercial banks have always done, but without deposit insurance and other aspects of the safety net provided for regulated depository institutions. After Lehman failed and the Reserve Fund ""broke the buck,"" money market fund investors realized that their investments were not as safe and liquid as ""money"" after all. There were widespread runs in these markets, and it took a U.S. Treasury guarantee, augmented by a number of unprecedented liquidity facilities established by the Federal Reserve, to stabilize the money market fund industry and, more importantly, stave off a sudden stoppage of the flow of credit to households and businesses. This experience tells us clearly that disruptions in the money markets can threaten the broader financial system. Regulation to increase the resilience of the money markets needs to reflect their systemic importance. Some important steps have been taken to address the most immediate risks--for example, through the liquidity standards for large institutions I mentioned earlier. But the risks associated with dislocations in the money markets go far beyond the large banks. to address the money market fund issue, notably through its 2014 rule amendments.  address so-called repo runs, the Financial Stability Board is in the final phases of developing a framework of margin rules designed to be applied uniformly across nations for securities financing transactions involving nongovernmental securities. These minimum standards should increase the resiliency of those markets and mitigate the pressures on terms that inevitably emerge during benign periods. We expect to propose regulations implementing these rules in the United States in due course. That brings me to the credit markets, where households, businesses and governments engage in borrowing to fund their purchases and operations. These markets figured importantly in the crisis, most notoriously through securities collateralized by subprime mortgages. The story is by now well known. Lenders offered these loans to retail borrowers, often with negligible or simply fraudulent underwriting. Many of our largest financial institutions packaged the loans into marginally capitalized securitization structures that were rated highly by the credit rating agencies and thus generally viewed as suitable for purchase by a range of investors--including the most risk averse. As conditions in the housing market deteriorated, the threat of significant mortgage defaults emerged in 2007. The panic began in earnest when it became apparent that exposure to subprime mortgages was ubiquitous, from the balance sheets of key financial intermediaries and their supposedly ""off balance sheet"" vehicles to the investment portfolios of other institutional investors around the world. Although the total losses were initially thought to be not so large as to threaten the system, some of these toxic mortgage-backed securities (MBS) were financed with the types of short-term, confidence-sensitive funding mechanisms I have just described, which amplified the  dislocations once the run in funding markets began and caused great harm to the broader economy. As the crisis has receded, supervisors--not to mention market participants, commentators, and the general public--have eyed financial markets with a heightened sensitivity to anything that resembles the buildup of risks that occurred in the run-up to the crisis--a natural and useful exercise in pattern recognition. In that spirit, the Fed, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the FDIC have focused significant attention on the origination activities of depository institutions in the syndicated leveraged loan market, where some of the troubling patterns that were evident in subprime MBS have been observed. These conditions prompted policymakers first to ask questions and then to act. Fed officials raised concerns publicly as early as 2011. The Fed, the OCC, and the FDIC issued supervisory guidance emphasizing these concerns in 2013. agencies clarified the guidance through published FAQs and began to exercise intensive supervision at the largest regulated banks emphasizing the need to improve underwriting standards and credit risk management on safety and soundness grounds.  The case of the leveraged loan market is an interesting one, because it sits at the intersection between core financial institutions and credit markets and illustrates the challenges supervisors face in thinking about intervention in credit markets. I will turn to that market now in some detail. The term portions of leveraged loans are typically not held in the arranging banks' portfolios, but rather sold to a wide range of institutional investors--collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), retail loan funds, pension funds, insurance companies, hedge funds, a range of markets and reflects the movement over several decades of credit intermediation from portfolio lending (from the firm's perspective, the ""storage business"") to the capital markets (the ""moving business""). This practice transfers and disperses credit and liquidity risks from the core of the financial sector to capital market investors that are willing to bear such risks for what they deem appropriate compensation. While the risks do not disappear, the system can, in principle, be safer if the ultimate institutional investors pose lower risk to the system than banks. For example, movement of credit exposure to speculative grade firms from a bank's balance sheet to a vehicle that is stably funded by sophisticated, deep-pocket institutional investors could be a net gain to financial stability. Movement of such loans to a highly leveraged, runnable vehicle beyond the regulatory perimeter could have the opposite effect. Pre-crisis conditions in leveraged finance markets were, with the benefit of hindsight, clearly in bubble territory. Deal leverage was at historically high levels (figure 3), and spreads were at historic lows (figure 4). Interest coverage ratios were quite low  (figure 5). Unusually large leveraged buyouts were common. Banks entered into very large, long duration commitments to fund deals that faced significant regulatory and other requirements before they could close. Estimates vary, but when the crisis emerged and liquidity in these markets evaporated, large dealers were left holding roughly $350 billion in loans and commitments in their pipelines that they could not sell, and these positions remained on banks' balance sheets for a time. As loan values declined an unprecedented 40 percent (figure 6), there were significant mark-to-market losses on these assets, which may have contributed to doubts about the condition of institutions at the core of the system. Subsequent default rates were not outsized by historical standards, and recovery rates were in line with past averages (figure 7). Of course, the Fed's monetary policy eased financial conditions across the economy and enabled the refinancing of many of these loans at lower rates and with issuer-friendly terms. Because leveraged loans were generally not held in investment structures that used short-term, confidence-sensitive funding, these investments were not a principal focal point of runs such as those that plagued MBS funding structures. CLOs were the largest institutional investors in leveraged loans, holding over 50 percent of loans outstanding. These structures are funded with stable capital, with both equity and debt tranches committed for several years--a longer duration than that of the underlying loans. This picture of the pre-crisis leveraged lending market is one of a sharp decline in underwriting standards and a breakdown of risk management, resulting in a large risk buildup involving many of the G-SIBs--something the Fed and other regulators want to avoid. Leveraged loans may not have been a material cause of the crisis, and leveraged lending alone would likely not have threatened the overall health of the large institutions.  But caution on the part of supervisors is certainly understandable here. It is worth remembering that the destructive potential of the subprime mortgage market was not obvious in advance and not fully reflected in real-time measures of balance sheet exposure. In light of that demonstrated uncertainty, since the crisis, supervisors have opted to react earlier and more aggressively to the buildup of risk. Let's now turn to post-crisis market conditions, which exhibit both similarities and differences compared with the pre-crisis period. Borrowing through leveraged loans by speculative-grade companies has been brisk since 2010, with about $800 billion of institutional loans now outstanding (figure 8). Over much of the post-crisis low interest rate period, demand for higher-yielding assets has been very strong, often outstripping supply. Price and nonprice terms in the syndicated leveraged loan market have been highly favorable to borrowers, as credit spreads declined, albeit not to particularly low agreements that lack traditional maintenance covenants increased to historic highs CLOs and other stably funded investors continue to be the primary owners of leveraged loans. But in recent years, mutual funds that invest in fixed income assets have seen large inflows and have become more significant investors in this market. Some of these funds, including those holding syndicated leveraged loans and high-yield bonds, provide investors with what is called ""liquidity transformation""--providing daily liquidity  even when the underlying assets are relatively illiquid. The risk is that, in the event of a shock or a panic, investors will demand all of their money back at the exact time when the liquidity of the already illiquid underlying assets deteriorates even further. Investors may not anticipate or recognize this problem until it is too late--the so-called liquidity illusion. Bank loan funds, which attract retail investors and offer daily liquidity, now total about $150 billion, or 20 percent of institutional leveraged loans outstanding (figure 11). The liquidity transformation provided by these funds has not created problems so far despite recent outflows from bank loan funds, but supervisors and market participants have raised valid concerns that stressful times could well bring large-scale redemptions regarding open-ended mutual funds a priority for the SEC. While it is possible to observe the characteristics of cash market investments, it is far more challenging to assess comparable positions in the derivatives and secured lending markets. Investors may take highly leveraged positions in leveraged loans through total return swaps and secured funding transactions, and a substantial buildup of these positions could present run and fire-sale risks if asset values started to fall. Today, the evidence suggests that such positions are fairly limited, but challenges in measurement and data make it hard to get a clear picture. While some of these conditions evoke the pre-crisis bubble period and thus raise red flags, there are important differences as well. The large institutions that arrange these  loans have significantly reduced both the size and duration of their leveraged loan commitments (figure 13). Thus, they are not exposed to the large ""pipeline risk"" they faced as the crisis broke. In addition, banks now routinely limit their risk by including ""flex"" provisions that, among other things, enable them to increase the interest rate on a loan offered for sale by 150 basis points or more, at the borrower's expense. So far, we have not seen the very large transactions of the pre-crisis period. In these and other respects, the leveraged finance markets have evolved, probably because of supervision as well as lessons learned by the banks themselves. Given these changes, banks at the core of our financial system seem less likely to experience stress should conditions in leveraged lending deteriorate. Of course, the guidance now stands in the way of a return to pre-crisis conditions. Let's now step back from the leveraged loan market to ask the broader question of how supervisors should address a clear deterioration of credit market conditions. I will consider three factors that are often discussed in considering the broader question of when and how to intervene in the credit markets to promote financial stability through institution-specific supervisory policy. do conditions present a threat to the safety and soundness of financial institutions at the core of the system?  It hardly needs saying that we must to be alert to the buildup of risks in the credit markets that could undermine the safety, soundness, or solvency of the G-SIBs or the broader system. If deterioration in one or more of the key credit markets would credibly raise such threats, the Fed and the other supervisors should react preemptively. An object lesson in this regard is the damage done by the accumulation of excessive exposures to high-risk MBS and other mortgage-related assets in the years leading up to the crisis. The originate-to-distribute model of mortgage lending on its face promised a social-welfare-enhancing distribution of mortgage credit risk away from banks and toward stable capital market investors. But the banks remained profoundly exposed through contractual putback rights, mortgage and MBS litigation, residual balance sheet holdings, and implicit support to sponsored investment vehicles. Since the crisis, there have been significant and eminently justified legislative and regulatory actions to assure that mortgage originators follow minimum underwriting standards and that banks are better protected from exposure to high-risk mortgages. These efforts include the Dodd-Frank risk retention rules and ability-to-pay standards, much higher capital and liquidity requirements, stricter accounting rules that limit off-balance-sheet treatment for sponsored vehicles, and a much greater supervisory focus on litigation and reputational risk. Second, is there use of run-prone financing by other investors that can lead to damaging fire sales? Supervisors should be highly alert to the reemergence in the markets--that is, not on the balance sheets of the large banks--of structures that are prone to runs and damaging fire sales triggered by sharp declines in asset values. As I mentioned earlier,  two different features can create vulnerability to runs and fire-sale risk. The first involves funding of volatile assets with high leverage that includes short-term, confidence sensitive debt. These structures were widely used before the crisis in the funding of MBS. The second involves ""liquidity transformation,"" in which the investment structure provides investors daily liquidity, but the underlying assets are far less liquid and prone to becoming quite illiquid in times of stress. Either or both of these features can be replicated in the derivatives or securities lending markets, which provide less visibility to market participants and supervisors. Financial markets evolve constantly in response to market conditions, financial engineering, and regulation. It will be important to keep up with trends in these markets that may give rise to this threat. Third, if left unaddressed, is it likely that conditions will risk meaningful damage to the real economy when the credit cycle turns? A positive answer on either of the first two questions should raise red flags for supervisors. Let's say, for the sake of argument, that the answers to these questions were negative. One might still try to make the case for supervisory intervention into the credit markets to avoid the risk of meaningful damage to the economy down the road. History shows that excesses that occur at the height of a credit boom can result in substantial losses not just to financial firms and market investors, but also to households and businesses, when that boom turns to bust.  The question of whether to ""lean against"" the credit cycle through supervisory policy--and when, and with what tools--is a difficult one. An important threshold question is whether supervisors will be able to correctly and in a timely manner identify ""dangerous"" conditions in credit markets, without too many false positives and without unnecessarily limiting credit availability by interfering with market forces. Interesting recent research seeks to identify observable variables that could be used to monitor credit conditions and detect trends that could threaten the performance of the real economy in the future. This research is promising, and it could be used by supervisors to inform their thinking as it develops further. In the meantime, unless there is a plausible threat to the core of the system or potential for damaging fire sales, I would set a high bar for supervisory interventions to lean against the credit cycle. Such interventions would almost surely interfere with the traditional function of capital markets in allocating capital to productive uses and dispersing risk to the investors who willingly choose to bear it. Finally, another issue to consider when contemplating such intervention is that, particularly in the United States, activity is free to migrate outside the commercial banking system into less regulated entities. As supervisory scrutiny has increased in recent years, a growing number of nonbanks have become involved in the distribution of leveraged loans. Migration of this activity could be either a net positive or a net negative for financial stability, depending on whether it actually transfers risk irrevocably from the  core of the financial system, and whether the institutions to which activity migrates rely on funding that is stable and robust to fire sale dynamics. To wrap up, I believe that sustaining financial stability requires supervisors to consider financial markets, in addition to financial institutions and infrastructure. That is most obviously so when conditions threaten the safety and soundness of the financial system through leverage, liquidity transformation, or deterioration of credit underwriting or other risk-management standards. At the same time, financial stability need not seek to eliminate all risks. We need to learn, but not overlearn, the lessons of the crisis. I believe there should be a high bar for ""leaning against the credit cycle"" in the absence of credible threats to the core or the reemergence of run-prone funding structures. In my view, the Fed and other prudential and market regulators should resist interfering with the role of markets in allocating capital to issuers and risk to investors unless the case for doing so is strong and the available tools can achieve the objective in a targeted manner and with a high degree of confidence.","['banking', 'banks', 'finance', 'lending', 'financing']","['banking regulated', 'regulated banks', 'banks stable', 'credit liquidity', 'commercial banking']","['systemically important banks', 'crisis leveraged lending', 'commercial banking regulated', 'markets commercial banks', 'regulated banks emphasizing']"
7326,r160520a_FOMC,united states,2016-05-20,Insurance Companies and the Role of the Federal Reserve,tarullo,0,"It is a pleasure to be here with you this morning to discuss the statutory role of the Federal Reserve in supervising and regulating insurance firms. Since we inherited from the Office of Thrift Supervision the oversight of savings and loan holding companies (SLHCs) that contain insurance companies, we have looked at our role as complementing the role you--as insurance regulators--play. We value the interaction we have had with state insurance commissioners on policy matters and are pleased with the growth of ongoing, regularized cooperation in supervising the firms over which we both have oversight authority. Personally, I have profited enormously from the assistance provided by the staff of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) as I delved into the history and practice of capital regulation of insurance companies. Today I would like to begin by describing how I view the Federal Reserve's role in insurance regulation and supervision--both what it is and what it is not. As I think you will find, we have tried to occupy that role in a way that is closely grounded in the duties that Congress has given us. Then I will present current thinking on a topic that I know has occasioned great interest--the Federal Reserve's plans for adopting capital requirements for the insurance firms over which we now have statutory responsibilities. The U.S. insurance industry has historically been, and remains, a significant part of the U.S. economy. For the industry across all sectors, written premiums last year totaled nearly $2 trillion and earned premiums totaled nearly $1.8 trillion, representing increases from 2014 of approximately 6 percent and 4 percent, respectively. gross domestic product, as it has in recent years. The two largest sectors in the U.S. insurance industry, property/casualty and life/annuities, together wrote approximately $1 trillion of premiums in 2015, up nearly 3 percent from the year prior. industry as a whole, written and earned premium last year were the highest in five years. gave the Federal Reserve regulatory responsibilities both for insurance holding companies that own a federally insured bank or thrift and for insurance companies designated as systemically companies for which the Federal Reserve is the consolidated supervisor hold about $2 trillion in total assets, representing about one-quarter of U.S. insurance industry assets. These firms are highly diverse: they range in size from firms with total assets of approximately $3 billion to firms with total assets of over $700 billion. They engage in a wide variety of insurance and non- insurance activities. Some are fully domestic, while others have material international operations. Some are organized as mutual companies, while others are owned by public shareholders. The approach of the Federal Reserve in regulating insurance holding companies is derived from its overall statutory responsibilities for financial regulation as those have evolved over the years, most recently through the changes made by the Dodd-Frank Act. First, as was the case prior to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, we are responsible for protecting the safety and soundness of federally insured depository institutions affiliated with any kind of holding company. With the Dodd-Frank Act's transfer of SLHC oversight to the Federal Reserve, that statutory responsibility now includes insurance holding companies. While the particulars are somewhat different than for bank holding companies, the aim and many of the tools to achieve this aim are the same. Second, the Dodd-Frank Act sharpened our statutory mandate to make clear that the Federal Reserve is to regulate and supervise holding companies with a view to the safety and soundness of not only the holding company itself, but also its functionally regulated subsidiaries, including affiliated insured depository institutions. Again, while the particulars differ, this mandate applies to SLHCs as well as to bank holding companies. Act of 1999 had, at the least, rendered ambiguous the question of whether the Federal Reserve could take supervisory measures that involved a functionally regulated subsidiary of a holding company unless a specific threat to an affiliated depository institution could be established. The financial crisis underscored the importance for safety and soundness of not waiting until problems in the holding company were manifestly affecting the depository institution. Third, the Dodd-Frank Act also changed our statutory mandate to require that we regulate holding companies so as to promote the stability of the financial system as a whole. This means paying attention to interconnections among financial firms, correlations of asset holdings, and other characteristics that could endanger the nation's financial stability during periods of stress. One of the most notable differences between the Dodd-Frank Act and other financial legislation over the preceding half century is the frequency with which the phrases ""financial stability"" and ""systemic risk"" occur, either as the specific goal of certain new provisions or as a consideration to be taken into account in administering general regulatory authorities. As I have explained elsewhere, this systemic or ""macroprudential"" regulatory aim does not apply equally to all holding companies or banks. Indeed, with respect to community banks, for example, it does not really apply at all. It is important that financial regulation be tiered so as to regulate for the kinds of risks various groups of financial institutions actually pose, rather than to regulate in a monolithic fashion. Fourth, for all the broadening of our statutory mandate, one feature of the financial regulatory system that the Dodd-Frank Act preserved was the functional regulation of holding company affiliates based on the kind of financial intermediation in which they are engaged. Thus, even though we do apply consolidated capital and liquidity requirements at the holding company level, we do not specifically apply them to broker-dealer, commodities merchant, or investment company affiliates. Nor do we have any role in the investor protection and market functioning mandates in the regulatory regimes administered by the Securities and Exchange role in regulating the types of insurance offered by affiliates of the holding companies we supervise or the manner in which the insurance is provided. These matters are the province of state insurance regulators. In fact, because of the overall structure of insurance regulation as specified by Congress in the McCarran-Ferguson Act and elsewhere, the line here is arguably brighter than in other areas. In pursuing what might be termed its dual regulatory mandate of protecting the safety and soundness of depository institutions and their holding companies and promoting financial stability, the Federal Reserve must develop regulatory and supervisory measures that are appropriate for a range of non-bank financial intermediaries. Consider, for example, the risks associated with bank holding companies containing large broker-dealer operations. Unlike traditional commercial banks whose activities are funded with retail deposits, these bank holding companies are typically heavily reliant on repurchase agreements (or repos) and other types of short-term wholesale funding. The events of 2007 to 2008 reminded us that, while this type of funding may be very stable during normal times, it can disappear overnight in periods of stress. Runs by providers of short-term wholesale funding may not only precipitate the failure of an individual firm by depleting that firm's capital and liquidity buffers, but also precipitate contagion that can imperil the rest of the financial system. As a result of this very dynamic during the financial crisis, the five large, formerly freestanding broker-dealers have mostly been absorbed by, or converted into, bank holding companies. In our post-crisis development of liquidity requirements and stress testing, and in reforming capital requirements, we needed to pay particular heed to these critical funding differences between traditional commercial banks and broker-dealers. Similarly, in building out our regulation and supervision of insurance companies, we are paying particular attention to how their funding patterns differ from other forms of financial intermediaries. Here, though, the major relevant difference is that the funding structures of traditional insurers are generally much more stable than the funding structures of commercial banks, much less broker-dealers. A traditional insurance company's liabilities are largely composed of contingent claims based on the occurrence of specified events, such as the death of an insured person or the destruction of property. Because these claims generally cannot be accelerated, companies engaged in traditional insurance activities are less vulnerable to runs and, accordingly, to short-term pressures to sell assets into declining markets. This insulation from creditor runs in turn suggests that capital and liquidity requirements for insurance companies should be calibrated differently than capital and liquidity requirements for dealer banks. Because Congress modified the Collins Amendment in late 2014, we can now tailor capital requirements for insurance companies. However, it is important to add that the balance sheet of an insurance company can look quite different from the traditional picture I have just sketched. For example, a life insurer may offer investment and retirement products with account values that can be withdrawn at the discretion of policyholders, sometimes with little or no surrender penalty. The option to surrender creates the potential for increased claims that could strain the liquidity of the firm. Relatedly, the extensive involvement of an insurance firm in securities lending, repo, over-the- counter derivatives, and other capital markets activities can create a balance sheet with much tighter connections to the rest of the financial system and greater liquidity risk in times of financial market stress. As with other financial intermediaries, insurers then become subject to demands for posting additional collateral or closing out positions as unfavorable market conditions take hold. In addition, if the positions of the insurance company are large enough, it could become a potential vehicle for transmitting distress at the company to other parts of the financial system. The foregoing considerations suggest that we should distinguish between insurance companies that we oversee solely because they own an insured depository institution and those that have been designated as systemically important by the FSOC. This is precisely the path we are taking with regard to our supervision of these firms. For the former group, our supervisory efforts to date have focused on ensuring that the companies have strong internal controls and effective corporate governance, as well as satisfactory risk identification, measurement, and management. For firms designated as systemically important, our supervision has additionally emphasized capital and liquidity planning and positions, management of core business lines, and recovery and resolution planning. Board staff meets with the primary state insurance departments that supervise the insurance companies for which we have consolidated supervisory responsibility and, together with lead state supervisors, we co-host supervisory colleges and continue to discuss supervisory plans and findings for the insurance firms, extend invitations for joint inspection activities, and discuss common areas of supervisory focus. As you likely know, the Board is also working to develop a regulatory framework for its supervised insurance companies. The Dodd-Frank Act authorizes the Board to establish minimum capital requirements for both systemically important insurance companies and SLHCs and bank holding companies predominantly engaged in insurance activities. For systemically important insurance companies, the Dodd-Frank Act directs the Board to establish enhanced prudential standards in order to mitigate risks to U.S. financial stability that could arise from the material distress, failure, or ongoing activities of these companies. The enhanced prudential standards must include, among other things, enhanced capital requirements, liquidity requirements, corporate governance and risk-management standards, and resolution planning requirements. We have already established resolution planning requirements for the systemically important firms. At present, we have three major regulatory initiatives underway for our supervised insurance firms: first, reporting requirements for the systemically important firms; second, enhanced corporate governance, risk management, and liquidity standards for those same firms; and third, capital requirements for all supervised insurance firms. Let me say a few words about the first two and then spend the rest of my remarks on capital requirements, which I know are probably of the greatest interest. About a month ago, the Federal Reserve proposed new reporting requirements specifically for the systemically important insurance companies. These reporting requirements are designed, among other things, to keep us informed as to the financial condition and risk profile of these firms, as well as the extent to which their activities and operations could pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States. The proposed reporting requirements differ substantially from reporting requirements for bank holding companies, and from available U.S. SEC. They are highly tailored to the assets, liabilities, and risks of insurance companies. We look forward to receiving public comment on the proposal. Regarding enhanced prudential standards, the Federal Reserve's enhanced corporate governance and risk-management standards for systemically important insurance companies will likely build on the core provisions of our consolidated supervisory framework for large domestic and foreign banking organizations, with appropriate adjustments to reflect these firms' predominantly insurance business model. The framework will mandate standards for the systemically important insurance companies to follow in managing risk and will identify the parties responsible for ensuring the integrity of a company's risk-management practices. Enhanced liquidity requirements will likely include internal control requirements, general comprehensive cash flow projections, contingency plans to manage liquidity stress events, and internal liquidity stress testing requirements. I expect that these proposed enhanced prudential standards for systemically important insurance companies will be considered by the Board in the coming weeks. Of course, we look forward to public comment on these standards, once proposed. In formulating capital standards for the insurance companies we supervise, our goals should track our overall goals in financial regulation, as I described them a few moments ago. Thus we should aim, first, to protect depository institutions and, second, to promote financial stability in a manner that takes account of both the unique form of financial intermediation reflected in the traditional insurance business and the activities by a few firms that are much more closely connected to short-term financial markets and the rest of the financial system. As with some of the other measures I have mentioned, these factors argue for different approaches to capital requirements for the systemically important insurance companies, on the one hand, and for the rest of the insurance companies we supervise, on the other. That is, indeed, the direction in which I believe we are headed. There are, as all of you know, a lot of ideas out there as to how we should construct the capital requirements we will apply to insurance companies. Some, such as variations on the Solvency II approach used in the European Union, strike us as unpromising. The valuation frameworks for insurance liabilities adopted in Solvency II differ starkly from U.S. GAAP and may introduce excessive volatility. Such an approach would also be inconsistent with our strong preference for building a predominantly standardized risk-based capital rule that enables comparisons across firms without excessive reliance on internal models. Finally, it appears that Solvency II could be quite pro-cyclical. Other ideas have some conceptual appeal, but strike us as impractical for the foreseeable future. Most prominent among these is an approach based on internal cash flow stress testing. The appeal of this idea lies in its melding of capital and liquidity considerations. The relationship between a firm's capital levels and liquidity profile is something that needs to be kept in mind when formulating regulatory regimes for all forms of financial intermediaries. However, as I noted earlier, we are reluctant to rely on internal models for basic regulatory capital requirements, which makes this idea less appealing to us. The novelty and untested nature of this idea as a basis for regulation would, in any case, necessitate extensive development, likely over a period of years. While we have consciously taken a good bit of time in considering a capital regime for our supervised insurance firms in order to make sure we get it right, we cannot wait years more, especially because there is no guarantee that even this investment of effort would produce a feasible internal models-based capital rule. However, I think it is worth continuing to explore internal cash flow stress testing as we build the supervisory stress testing program for systemically important insurance companies. Another set of possibilities is raised by the work of the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS). As part of its effort to create a common framework for the supervision of internationally active insurance groups, the IAIS began work on a comprehensive insurance capital standard (ICS) in 2013, issued an initial consultative proposal on the ICS in late 2014, and will continue work on the ICS for at least the next few years. The ICS would be the first international, group-wide capital standard broadly applicable to internationally active insurance groups and would incorporate internationally compatible valuation principles, definitions of capital resources, and risk-based capital requirements for assets and insurance liabilities. Progress in developing such a global capital standard for internationally active insurance firms has been slow. I will mention some of the difficulties that have been encountered. First, there is considerable heterogeneity among the insurance products offered in different jurisdictions. As one example, annuities and other savings and retirement products tend to be offered less frequently in countries with relatively expansive government pension programs. In the context of developing capital requirements, a second factor has been jurisdictional variations in accounting and valuation standards on which global capital requirements for insurance companies can be built. A third factor has been significant disagreement on the extent to which capital standards for internationally active insurance companies should be built on internal models. These challenges and the protracted process they have occasioned have, as a practical matter, rendered the ICS insufficiently developed to be an option as the Federal Reserve moves forward with capital requirements applicable to the insurance companies we supervise. A second relevant initiative of the IAIS involves the design of an enhanced regulatory and supervisory framework for global systemically important insurers (G-SIIs). In 2014, the consolidated capital standard developed for the insurance industry. The IAIS developed the BCR in an effort to ensure the soundness of global insurance firms with the largest systemic capital standard for G-SIIs. But the IAIS will need to revisit the BCR after the first version of ICS is complete and will also need to revisit HLA after further refinement is made on its G-SII identification methodology. This somewhat provisional character of the BCR, along with its reliance on a method of valuation not in use by U.S. companies and regulators, mean it does not really fit our need for an approach that can--as a practical matter--be developed and implemented in the relatively near term. These are some of the paths we do not intend to take in formulating capital requirements for insurance firms. The approach we do intend to follow will be elaborated in what I anticipate will be an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) to be issued in the coming weeks. As I suggested earlier, the ANPR will likely put forward two different methodologies--one for the insurance firms that we supervise solely because they own a bank or thrift and the other for the firms designated as systemically important. The Federal Reserve has traditionally set capital requirements for holding companies on a consolidated basis. Among other things, a consolidated capital standard deters firms from moving assets around its affiliates in order to take advantage of lower requirements applied to different affiliates for particular assets. Insofar as publicly traded banking organizations are required by securities laws to file consolidated, U.S. GAAP-consistent financial statements, there is both a parallelism between accounting and capital regulation and a measure of economy in the compliance costs of a consolidated capital rule. In contrast, most insurance firms subject to our regulation only because they own depository institutions do not produce consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, Congress has prohibited the Federal Reserve from requiring insurance firms that file only Statutory statements. Given that these firms have not been designated systemically important and that the depository institutions they own tend to be relatively small parts of the total firm, the compliance costs of requiring a move to some non-U.S. GAAP form of consolidated approach may well not be worth the incremental safety and soundness benefits of doing so. Together, these considerations are leading us to what we refer to as the building block approach (BBA), which is likely the approach that we will put forth for comment in the ANPR for this group of firms. The BBA would aggregate capital resources and capital requirements across the different legal entities in the group to calculate combined, group-level capital resources and requirements. A firm's aggregate capital requirements generally would be the sum of the capital requirements at each subsidiary. The capital requirement for each regulated insurance or depository institution subsidiary generally would be based on the regulatory capital rules of that subsidiary's lead regulator--whether a state or foreign insurance regulator or a federal banking regulator for depository institutions. The regulatory capital requirement for any non-insurance, non-banking subsidiaries--which at present are relatively minor parts of these firms--would probably be determined under the standardized risk-based capital rules applicable to affiliates of bank holding companies. Should we adopt this approach, we will need to develop a formula or scalar to put the different regulatory regimes on a comparable basis. With an eye towards the kind of issues that are usually addressed by a consolidated capital approach, we will also need to fashion standards for adjustments to address inter-company transactions and possibly some other exposures. An example of the latter would be potential adjustments to harmonize permitted accounting practices that vary across states. The BBA would efficiently leverage existing legal-entity-level regulatory capital frameworks that already apply to the various units of the supervised insurance group. As such, it would involve relatively low regulatory burden for these entities, even as it produces regulatory capital requirements that are reasonably well tailored to the insurance-related risks for each distinct jurisdiction and business line of the group. By definition, the insurance companies designated by the FSOC are systemically important. For these firms, application of an aggregated approach like that of the BBA could pose significant risks to the Federal Reserve's statutory aims of safety and soundness and financial stability. The BBA, recall, would simply aggregate capital requirements that may not be founded upon financial stability considerations. A consolidated form of capital requirements is key to ensuring that risks to the financial system as a whole (as compared, say, to investor or policyholder protection) are accounted for. For these firms, then, the ANPR is likely to seek comment on what we have internally been calling the consolidated approach (CA). Let me note at the outset that this is not the consolidated capital framework we apply to bank holding companies. As with our capital requirements for bank holding companies, the CA would categorize all of the consolidated insurance group's assets and insurance liabilities into risk segments, apply risk factors to the amounts in each segment, and then set a minimum ratio of required capital comparing the consolidated capital requirements to the group's consolidated capital resources. However, the CA would use risk weights or risk factors that are more appropriate for the longer-term nature of most insurance liabilities. Like the BCR of the IAIS, the CA would take a consolidated approach to capital requirements. However, unlike the BCR, the foundation of the CA would be consolidated financial information based on U.S. GAAP, with appropriate adjustments for regulatory purposes. Our current thought is that the CA would initially be relatively simple in design, with a relatively small number of risk categories. Thus there would be a broad risk segmentation of asset classes and insurance liabilities. However, as we gained experience with the CA, we would have the option of making it increasingly granular in order to achieve greater risk sensitivity. The CA, as a consolidated capital framework, would help prevent intra-group regulatory arbitrage opportunities and the potential for double leverage. It would also be compatible with supervisory stress testing, which--as you all know--is now a central component of our supervisory program for making systemically important firms highly resilient, as well as for giving us a more complete picture of risks in the financial system as a whole. Obviously, the compliance costs associated with the CA will be higher than those of the BBA. But this enhanced regulation is justified by the increased risks to the financial system associated with these firms. Indeed, it is our obligation under the Dodd-Frank Act to impose stricter regulation on these firms. Even so, by constructing a separate consolidated approach to capital for systemically designated insurance firms, compliance costs for these firms should be considerably lower than if they had to conform to the bank holding company capital regime. Finally, I would note that adoption by the Federal Reserve of a fully consolidated capital requirement for systemically important insurance companies might also help advance the international development of appropriate and effective capital requirements for insurance firms of global systemic importance. As noted earlier, the Board's prudential regulatory objectives pertaining to supervised insurance companies are to protect the safety and soundness of the consolidated company, to protect any subsidiary depository institutions of the company, and to mitigate any threats to financial stability that might be posed by the activities, material financial distress, or failure of the company. Just as we have done with other non-bank financial intermediaries for which we have been given regulatory responsibilities, we will fashion a regime that takes account of the particular characteristics and risks of those intermediaries. We have taken a good bit of time in arriving at some potential insurance regulatory capital frameworks precisely because we wanted to consider these issues thoroughly. Our tentative conclusion is that a bifurcated approach to a capital regime for insurance companies makes sense in light of these considerations. But we anticipate using the vehicle of an ANPR in order to give all interested parties an opportunity to comment on this approach before we turn to developing and proposing its details. In this process, we of course especially welcome the views of those of you on the front lines of insurance supervision.

7351,r161117a_FOMC,united states,2016-11-17,"The ""Gig"" Economy: Implications of the Growth of Contingent Work",brainard,0,"I would like to thank Bill Dudley and Sara Horowitz for inviting me to participate in today's conference. The subject we are tackling today--the evolution of work--is a particular interest of mine and is a matter of great importance to the Federal Reserve. The Congress has mandated the Federal Reserve to implement monetary policy so as to promote maximum employment and stable prices. Our dual mandate recognizes the importance of work in enabling people to contribute to the financial security of their family and the prosperity of their community and the country overall. Moreover, there is a long-standing recognition that secure and dignified work provides a key sense of purpose and worth. Understanding the changing nature of employment in today's economy is not only central to the mission of the Federal Reserve, but also goes to the core of who we are as providers for our families and productive members of society. In contrast to traditional work arrangements, in which an employee has a durable employment relationship with a single primary employer, a large and growing proportion of the workforce is working through contracting, temporary arrangements, on-call arrangements, or as freelancers being hired for episodic ""gigs."" Broadly speaking, contingent arrangements are more transitory than traditional arrangements, in the extreme consisting of a single transaction or gig. They often provide considerably greater flexibility than long-term employment contracts, allowing workers and employers to move in and out of work relationships easily. Depending on the nature of the  employment relationship, this enhanced flexibility could have benefits and costs that accrue to workers and employers very differently. Although they have always been a feature of the American economic landscape, there has been a sharp increase in the prevalence of contingent working arrangements over the past decade, and it is too early to tell how much of this acceleration is a cyclical phenomenon associated with the Great Recession or reflects a structural trend. growing share and variety of contingent work has important implications for policy and puts a premium on data and research exploring this topic. For monetary policy, the growth of contingent work affects the way we assess maximum employment and the way we interpret important labor market outcomes, such as the level of part-time employment and aggregate hours worked. Depending on the contractual arrangements, it may also have important implications for economic security and the behavior of households as consumers and savers. Richer and timely data and analysis could help guide employers, workers, and public officials toward outcomes where benefits and risks are better understood and managed. Official measures of the changing nature of work have not kept pace with the evolution of the economy. But thanks to some cutting-edge researchers, several of whom are present today, there is a growing foundation of analysis. Last year, Larry Katz and Alan Krueger conducted a version of the Contingent Worker Survey (CWS) to track alternative and nonstandard work arrangements using the Their findings are striking: Over the past decade,  contingent workers have increased by roughly one-half and now make up 16 percent of the workforce. This rapid increase is in marked contrast to the preceding decade, when contingent workers remained at a relatively stable 10 percent of the workforce, according They conclude that all of the net growth in aggregate employment in the decade leading up to 2015 can be accounted for by contingent work arrangements, which means there has been no net employment growth in traditional work arrangements. Given that this period spanned the Great Recession and the first five years of a slow recovery, it naturally raises the question of how much of the large recent shift toward contingent work is attributable to cyclical factors, as opposed to structural forces that may be here to stay. Long before the advent of firms such as Uber and TaskRabbit, many individuals worked in contingent arrangements, such as freelancing and contracting, and it is these groups that have increased their share of the workforce most notably over the past decade. The largest increase in contingent work over this time has been among workers whose services are contracted out by another company, which rose from 0.6 percent to 3.1 percent of the workforce. There was also a large increase in workers who are independent contractors, consultants, or freelancers, whose share grew from 6.9 percent  of the workforce. Over this same period, technological platforms have emerged that are transforming the way people identify, schedule, and engage in contingent work and are also helping people to monetize their assets to generate income. These developments, potential to be transformative. Although the data are still relatively sparse, it appears that the number of workers using online platforms to secure gigs is still small but is growing quickly. Katz and Krueger found that workers who provide services through three online intermediaries accounted for only 0.5 percent of all workers in 2015. Diana Farrell and Fiona Greig (2016) reach a similar conclusion, using a unique and rich data set. The Federal Reserve Board fielded a survey to better understand the many ways adults are generating income, regardless of their employment status and the frequency of these activities. The survey uses an expansive concept of contingent work, capturing all of the activity individuals are undertaking to generate income. The Enterprising and Informal Work Activity survey, or EIWA, suggests that more than a third--36 percent--of the adult population undertook informal paid work activity either as a complement to, or as a substitute for, more traditional and formal work arrangements. Similarly, a survey  undertaken by Upwork and the Freelancers Union that also uses an expansive definition of contingent work finds that 35 percent of the labor force engages in freelance work. The Upwork survey provides further insight by subdividing the 35 percent of the labor force who have done some form of informal work over the past 12 months into five categories. In the categories most comparable with the Katz and Krueger CWS categories, roughly 12 percent of the workforce identify as independent contractors who do not have an employer and engage in project-by-project work, whereas between 2 and 3 percent are traditional contract or temporary workers who have a single employer or project at a time and whose work status is temporary. By contrast, roughly half of the Upwork respondents do informal work in addition to traditional employment relationships; almost 10 percent derive their income from multiple different types of arrangements, including both traditional employment relationships and freelancing, while about 9 percent report having a full-time traditional job and ""moonlighting"" to gain additional income on top of that. The group that derives income from multiple different types of jobs has evidenced the fastest growth over the last few years covered by the survey. In addition, 2.5 percent identify as business owners.  Finally, the EIWA survey provides valuable insights into the use of recent technologies in informal work. The EIWA survey suggests that over the previous six months, roughly 11 percent of adults in the United States have engaged in paid services using an online platform, such as arranging transportation activities with companies such as Uber, arranging work opportunities on sites like Care.com, Amazon Mechanical Turk, or TaskRabbit, generating projects through companies such as Fiverr, selling goods and crafts on sites such as eBay and Etsy, and renting rooms or homes through services like Airbnb, among others. This figure is much larger than the Katz and Krueger finding of 0.5 percent, partly because the EIWA survey was fielded to all adults regardless of their formal employment status, asked about all online paid services, and used a six-month look-back period, rather than the past week. Together, these recent surveys of informal work paint a varied picture of the universe of informal work arrangements, along with participants' motivations for engaging in them. Nineteen percent of informal workers in the EIWA survey, for example, were engaged in three or more online and/or offline informal paid work activities in the prior six months, and 25 percent indicated that informal and contingent work activities have been ""very much"" or ""somewhat"" a regular and consistent source of their monthly income. Results regarding the ages of workers attracted to nontraditional work vary: Katz and Krueger find that the share of contingent work arrangements increases with age,  while the Upwork study finds that freelancing is more prevalent among the young. The earnings experiences of contingent workers appear to span a wide range. Katz and Krueger find that those engaged in contingent work tend to be concentrated in the highest income quintiles. But while independent contractors and contract workers earn relatively high wages, on-call and temporary-help work tends to occur among workers in lower wage quintiles. One common theme that emerges is the desire to earn extra money, which is a primary motivation for 74 percent of part-time, and 68 percent of full-time, freelancers in the Upwork survey. Similarly, in the EIWA survey, 65 percent of informal workers reported that earning income was their main reason for engaging in informal and contingent work, and the EIWA provides many examples that corroborate this result. full-time restaurant cook in his 50s, reports that he does yard work and sells items both online and offline to earn extra income and to help family members. He averages 60 hours per month from side and gig work and reported that these earnings constitute 75 percent of his household's monthly earnings. Similarly, a respondent in her 20s works part time as a dental hygienist and supplements this employment with about 8 hours per month of additional gig work. She said that the gig work somewhat mitigated the effect of the Great Recession, which found her working fewer hours, with stagnant wages and a loss of benefits. For others, work-life balance considerations seem to play a significant role in choosing contingent work arrangements. For example, a mother in her 20s reported spending 12 hours per month selling self-crafted items online, babysitting, and  completing online tasks, collectively providing about 20 percent of her family's income. She reported that her main reason for participating in the gig economy is to be home with her daughter. Many others find themselves in highly variable work arrangements not by preference but because of the requirements of their employers. As employers have outsourced noncore tasks to contract firms and moved to technologically enabled ""just- in-time"" scheduling of employees, contract workers and on-call workers have had to adjust to variable and sometimes unpredictable hours. As these stories indicate, there are a variety of reasons workers engage in alternative and nonstandard work arrangements. Many individuals use the flexibility and enhanced connectivity of new technology-enabled platforms to pursue expanded opportunities. While some supplement their traditional job, using their free time to earn extra income, others cobble together contingent work arrangements or gigs to generate necessary income in the absence of traditional work opportunities. Still others move into contingent work arrangements due to their employers' work requirements. While some workers seem to appreciate the greater opportunities contingent work arrangements provide, others engage in this work out of necessity because they appear unable to obtain a full-time traditional work arrangement that meets their needs. Overall, the Upwork study finds that 63 percent of freelancers say they are pursuing this type of work by choice, while 37 percent do it out of necessity. It is unclear whether this outcome would hold true of the more tightly defined population in the Katz and Krueger survey.  If market forces and technology are driving the growing prevalence of gig work, these trends will likely continue, and policymakers must better understand these changes. A natural starting point is measurement. There is some good news on this front, as the BLS is preparing to field a CWS in May 2017 for the first time since 2005. Better data should help deepen our understanding of how the growth of contingent work is changing the behavior of workers and employers and what these developments imply for the overall economy and household welfare. From a macroeconomic perspective, we should be attuned to the possibility that the growth in flexible work arrangements may alter the natural rate of employment and how the labor market reacts to shocks as we assess the cyclical behavior of important aggregates--such as labor force participation, employment, hours worked, and underemployment. One possibility is that new technologies, by lowering the barriers to workforce entry, could raise employment and labor force participation. Because there are fixed costs to obtaining and maintaining a job--such as searching for the job, learning about the job, and traveling to the job site every workday--the traditional work arrangement embeds incentives for individuals to work only one job, thus minimizing these fixed costs. And for those individuals who desire to work relatively few hours, these fixed costs in the past may have led to a decision to remain out of the labor force. But if technology makes it less costly for individuals to find work, manage multiple work relationships, and flexibly work more or fewer hours as their schedule permits, this could significantly increase workers' options and have important effects on labor market  behavior. Importantly, any such increases in participation and employment would likely be structural, not cyclical, enabling the economy to run at a sustainably higher level. New technologies could also make it easier for individuals' actual hours to match their desired hours of work in a day or a week. Instead of seeing hours per week bunched around 40, we may see greater variation in the hours that individuals work. Lower barriers to workforce entry may make it more attractive for more individuals to work only a few hours a week if they desire--and can afford--to do so. At the same time, by making it easier to find additional work, new technologies may lead to more individuals working greater-than-full-time hours every week. In addition, we may see individuals changing the number of hours they work more frequently, as these changes become less costly. Both the EIWA and Upwork surveys confirm that gig work does, indeed, lower barriers to workforce entry and increase hours and flexibility for some individuals. The increasing prevalence of gig work may also affect the unemployment rate and productivity. To the extent that gigs provide an easy entryway to employment, unemployment may decrease. However, if gig work is less stable, it may increase job loss. The net effect on unemployment is, thus, unclear. Regarding productivity, gig work could lower aggregate productivity to the extent that it requires less human capital or specialized knowledge than traditional jobs, or if it primarily increases hours worked by lower-skilled individuals. That said, gig work, especially when enabled by new technologies, may allow hours to respond more flexibly to changes in demand and individuals to more easily connect with many different clients or employers. As a result, workers' downtime and the time required to acquire new clients and manage existing clients may decrease, in which case resource utilization and productivity may increase.  It is also possible that the increasing prevalence of gig work will cause the cyclical behavior of unemployment, participation, and the workweek to change, with implications for how we assess the amount of slack. We know that contingent work increases when the economy worsens. If new technologies make it easier to find gig work, then we could see unemployment rise less in recessions, to the extent that gig workers are counted as employed. However, it could be that individuals who are able to avoid unemployment through contingent work would still be underemployed if it is difficult to cobble together enough gigs to achieve full-time employment. This would likely show up as lower average workweeks and higher levels of involuntary part-time employment during downturns. As a result, cyclical changes in resource utilization could be reflected less in movements in the unemployment rate and more in variation in hours per worker. Beyond the behavior of macroeconomic variables, it is unclear how the growth of different types of gig work affects the welfare of workers. Welfare should increase in cases where gig work meets the needs of workers by providing a low-barrier means of accessing employment and by allowing workers to better match actual hours worked with desired hours of work, especially if the gig work is available at times and in places where traditional work opportunities are in short supply. There is some evidence that this has, indeed, been the case. For example, 24 percent of informal workers in the EIWA survey indicated that contingent work had offset their spells of unemployment, loss of working hours, loss of benefits, or frozen wages in their formal employment ""very much"" or ""somewhat."" In addition, three-  fourths of Uber drivers say that the greater control over their work schedules that Uber allows has made their lives better. However, there are likely many workers who would prefer regular full-time traditional work to contingent work, particularly if much of the power in determining hours worked in alternative work arrangements belongs to the employer. Technological advances have enabled firms to use just-in-time strategies for their employees, making them in effect on-call workers. This is a rising trend in industries such as retail and food preparation. Several recent articles describe the challenges faced by these just-in-time workers, who must conform their hours to the daily and even hourly ebbs and flows of business, often not knowing whether they will have work on a given day until they call in that morning to inquire. These arrangements can leave workers scrambling to patch together child care, elder care, and transportation to meet the often unpredictable demands of their workplace, while making it difficult to engage in regularly scheduled activities to enhance their income and opportunities, such as a second job or career training. While such workers often are not given full-time work, they often must make themselves available to work full-time hours. According to one survey, 71 percent of retail workers in New York stated that their hours fluctuated from week to week, while half said their employers could change their hours at will. It is also notable that the increase in contingent work over the past decade has coincided with an increase of one-third in the share of employees working part time but who would prefer to work full time from 3 percent prior to the Great Recession to close to 4 percent today.  In addition, contingent workers may receive lower wages, less training, and fewer benefits than their counterparts with traditional jobs. Typically, the wages of low-skilled employees within a company are boosted by social norms regarding pay equity, and nonpecuniary benefits are often equalized across a company's employees, in certain cases as mandated by law. However, the wages that contractors receive are unlikely to reflect the same equity considerations. Moreover, contingent work generally does not offer employer-based benefits and workplace protections that come with traditional employment opportunities, like overtime compensation, minimum wage protections, health insurance, family leave, employer-sponsored retirement plans, workers' compensation, and paid sick leave. As a result, for some, contingent work may entail greater risks than in traditional full-time employment, with more variable and less predictable hours and earnings. The Upwork study notes that one of freelancers' biggest concerns is managing income variability and benefits. For lower-income workers, unpredictable fluctuations in income can lead to severe hardship. The Federal Reserve Board's Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking, for example, finds that 46 percent of households report that they would need to borrow money or sell something in order to pay an unexpected expense of $400. These findings suggest that employers, policymakers, and workers should seek ways to help individuals better manage the risks inherent in most forms of contingent work. For example, we may need to enhance social safety net programs, such as  unemployment and disability insurance, to better support some types of contingent work. Another possibility is to make benefits, such as health insurance and retirement saving, portable across different employers. We may also want to encourage the additional saving that many contingent workers need to ensure that their basic consumption needs are not sacrificed when demand for their work declines, perhaps by providing monetary or other types of incentives. The apparent trend toward contingent work has recently coincided with new advances in technology that can potentially amplify this trend and push it in new directions. We are still at an early stage in these developments, and it is too soon to say how these changes will play out. But the effects on the labor market could be long lasting and significant. Taking into account the potentially varied effects of the rising prevalence of gig work on household welfare, public policy should strive to maximize the benefits of the greater flexibility and lower entry barriers provided by advances in technology, while addressing the risks that currently accompany many forms of gig employment. Going forward, better data will be necessary, along with detailed research and analysis, in order to enable workers, employers, and policymakers to guide these changes in the labor market in a direction that ensures the benefits are broadly shared and the risks are well understood and well managed.  . . . . . . first_century_work_krueger_harris.pdf . .  .

7387,r170706a_FOMC,united states,2017-07-06,Government Policy and Labor Productivity,fischer,0,"I want to talk tonight about labor productivity growth. Labor productivity is the amount of goods and services produced per hour spent on the job. Increases in labor productivity--again, that's the amount of goods and services produced per hour on the job--are a fundamental factor in determining how fast the economy grows, and how fast the average standard of living grows. And productivity growth can be influenced by government policy, about which I also want to say a few words. Labor productivity growth varies a lot from year to year, but it is possible to discern longer historical periods with high or low productivity growth, as shown in figure 1. For example, labor productivity rose at an average annual rate of 3-1/4 percent from 1948 to 1973, whereas in the period 1974 to 2016, the average growth rate of productivity was about 1.7 percent. That is to say that, with the important exception of the information technology (IT) boom beginning in the mid-1990s, the U.S. economy has been in a low-productivity growth period since 1974. The record for the past five years has been particularly dismal. How much does productivity growth matter? A great deal. The person who made that clear, in an article published in 1957, 60 years ago, Professor Robert Solow, is here tonight. That is a pleasure, an honor, a joy, and something of a difficulty for anyone wanting to talk about productivity and its growth in the presence of the master. The reason the rate of productivity growth matters so much is that it is a basic determinant of the rate of growth of average income per capita over long periods.  understand that one needs to know only the trick of calculating how long it takes for a growing economy to double. A good rule of thumb for calculating the time it takes labor productivity (or anything else that is growing) to double can be calculated by dividing 70 by the growth rate. When labor productivity was growing at 3-1/4 percent per year--during the 25 years from 1948 to 1973--it took 22 years for labor productivity to double. Looking again at Figure 1, in the 42 years from 1974 to 2016, when labor productivity was growing on average at a rate of 1-3/4 percent, it would have taken approximately 41 years for labor productivity to double. There is a vast difference between the prospects facing the young in an economy where incomes per capita are doubling every 22 years and an economy in which incomes are on average doubling only every 41 years. Now, productivity statistics are imperfect in many respects--for example, capturing the value of the seemingly free apps we use on our smartphones is challenging. And many of us who live in the modern age cannot believe that the iPhone has not fundamentally changed our lives. It has certainly changed our lives to some extent, and there is likely some underestimation of productivity growth in the official data. But to figure out whether the current degree of data bias has reduced estimated growth, we have to ask not whether there is bias, but whether the bias has increased. To a first approximation, one could assume that the rate of bias is constant, and does not account for the estimated decline in productivity growth and that we should not dismiss the slowdown as an artifact of measurement difficulties That is the conclusion most researchers reach, but the data issue is not settled. As Bob Solow famously said, just  before the increase in productivity growth of 1996-2003, ""the computer is everywhere except in the growth data."" And there are serious researchers who have made serious arguments that we will soon be seeing more rapid growth in the productivity data. Factors determining productivity growth Clearly, a key question for economic forecasters, and even more so for U.S. citizens, and indeed for the entire global economy, is whether we should anticipate a return of the more rapid productivity gains experienced in the IT boom and for the quarter century after the end of World War II, or should instead resign ourselves to tepid economic growth in future years. And a central policy issue is whether government policies can help push the economy toward a higher-productivity regime. In this context, it is useful to think of labor productivity growth as coming from three sources, as shown in figure 2. First, greater investment by firms in tangible equipment and structures, as well as ""intangible"" investments such as software and product designs, raise labor productivity. Second, improvements in labor quality, or the capabilities of the workforce, contribute as well--through education, training, and experience. Finally, innovations yield more or better output from the same inputs--the same capital and labor--such as the introduction of the assembly line and computer-aided product design. I will consider the role that policy may play through each of these channels. It is noteworthy that most of the recent drop in productivity is due to a lower contribution from innovation, although weaker investment has played a role as well. The contribution to labor productivity from labor quality has changed very little.  Our prospects for further significant technological innovations are hotly debated. Some observers believe that we have exhausted the low-hanging fruit on the productivity tree and, in particular, that efficiency gains from the use of IT have run their course. Other observers argue that we can reach fruit higher on the tree with each passing year. These observers believe that innovation yields better tools, such as 3-D printers and genetic sequencing equipment, which themselves enable further technological advances. For what it is worth, I believe the early signs of self-driving cars, the emergence of disease treatments based on genetics, and the falling costs for conventional and alternative energy production suggest that we are continuing to innovate, both in IT as well as in other parts of the economy. One possibility is that we are in a productivity lull while firms reorganize to exploit the latest innovations; it took decades before the full benefits of the steam engine, electrification, and computers were seen. One way to ensure the vigor of innovation is to support research and development since recovered. However, government-funded R&D as a share of gross domestic product is at the lowest level in recent history. A great deal of the ""R"" in overall R&D is  government funded and not tied to a specific commercial goal. The applied research built on this basic research ultimately yields productivity gains far into the future. Consequently, the decline in government-funded R&D is disturbing. To raise productivity and economic well-being, firms must adopt innovations that emerge from R&D as quickly as possible. This adjustment may occur as start-ups introduce innovation to the market, as existing innovative firms expand, or as competing firms imitate the innovators. Recent research suggests that all three of these channels, which reflect the economic dynamism of businesses, have been operating sluggishly of late: New firms are not created as often as in the past, innovative firms are not hiring or investing as aggressively as they once did, and the diffusion of innovations is weak from frontier firms to trailing firms. It is difficult to pinpoint specific policy actions that would address this decline in dynamism. Broadly speaking, however, government policymakers should carefully consider the effects of regulations and tax policy on the free flow of workers, capital, and ideas. In recent years, the contribution to labor productivity growth from investment has declined. Business fixed investment rose roughly 2-1/2 percent per year, on average, from 2004 to 2016, compared with about 5 percent from 1996 to 2003. Some bright  spots do exist: Capital expenditure by leading IT companies--Google, Amazon, and the like--has soared since 2010, and investment in the energy sector has returned to life. Nevertheless, firms as a whole seem reluctant to invest. This cautious approach to investment may in part reflect uncertainty about the policy environment. By one measure, U.S. policy uncertainty was elevated for much of the recovery, subsided in 2013, and then rose again late last year, underpinned by uncertainty about policies associated with health care, regulation, taxes, and trade. Reasonable people can disagree about the right way forward on each of those issues, but mitigating the damping effect of uncertainty by providing more clarity on the future direction of government policy is highly desirable--particularly if the direction of policy itself is desirable. Government investment can be an important source of productivity growth as well. For example, the interstate highway system is credited with boosting productivity in the 1950s and 1960s. That highway system and many other federally supported roadways, waterways, and structures have been neglected in recent years. Indeed, real infrastructure spending (that is, adjusting for inflation) has fallen nearly 1 percent per year since 2005. This area of government investment deserves more attention.  Also important to raising labor productivity is investment in human capital-- workers' knowledge and skills. Such investment is a particular issue because most forecasts anticipate that the long rise in educational attainment--both for college and high school--may soon come to an end. One area where policy may play a role is promoting educational access and readiness for groups for whom educational attainment is relatively low. Recent research has shown a substantial return to public investment in early childhood education for economically disadvantaged groups. Such programs increase high school graduation, promote income over the life cycle for both participants and their parents, and produce other socially beneficial outcomes, such as greater health. At the other end of the education process, a college degree has long been considered a worthwhile investment, and thus our society should promote access to and readiness for college among a broad range of individuals--in particular through federal support for need-based financial aid. Lastly, I will note that ultimately the return on the human capital embodied in our workforce is closely tied to public health. A rise in morbidity or fall in longevity in the U.S. population is not a concern only for humanitarian reasons. Workers too ill to perform at their potential represent lost productivity and welfare for society as a whole. Research has shown just such a trend among prime-age non-Hispanic Americans without  a college degree. More study is needed to determine what policies would help reverse this trend, and government funding could likely assist the effort. More broadly, programs to promote clean air and drinking water are examples of public health policies that bolster the health and longevity of the present and future workforce as a whole. Concluding remarks To conclude, we return to the basic question: How much does productivity growth matter? The basic answer: simple arithmetic says it matters a lot. If labor productivity grows an average of 2 percent per year, average living standards for our children's generation will be twice what we experienced. If labor productivity grows an average of 1 percent per year, the difference is dramatic: Living standards will take two generations to double. But fortunately, when it comes to productivity, we are not simply consigned to luck or to fate. Governments can take sensible actions to promote more rapid productivity growth. Broadly speaking, government policy works best when it can address a need that the private sector neglects, including investment in basic research, infrastructure, early childhood education, schooling, and public health. Reasonable people can disagree about the right way forward, but if we as a society are to succeed, we need to follow policies that will support and advance productivity growth. That is easier said than done. But it can be done.  Frontier firms, technology diffusion and public policy: Micro evidence from OECD countries, . . .  .

7460,r190210a_FOMC,united states,2019-02-10,Ideas of Order: Charting a Course for the Financial Stability Board,quarles,0,"Let me begin by thanking the Bank for International Settlements and Agustin Carstens for the invitation to join you today. In considering venues for my inaugural speech as chair of honor to be here, in Hong Kong, with colleagues from around the world, representing central banks who are committed to advancing financial stability not only in their home countries but also globally. I would like to discuss with you tonight my view of how the work of the FSB must evolve, and some key principles that I think should inform that work. My predecessor, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, guided the FSB for the last seven years along a path that was formidably challenging. The Global Financial Crisis had exposed fault lines in the financial system that had to be addressed immediately, comprehensively, and vigorously. The body of post-crisis regulation that has resulted, though it involved the energy and efforts of a kaleidoscopically varied host of standard setters, regulators, and central banks--including all the institutions in this room--was nonetheless accomplished under the aegis and at the instigation of the FSB. It was a tour de force of orchestration, and it has unquestionably made the financial system safer and more resilient. Today, however, the post-crisis reform agenda has been largely completed. Basel III is final, the largest global banks have substantially more capital and liquidity, over-the-counter derivatives markets are safer, and steps have been taken to address the risks of too-big-to-to fail institutions. Through greater monitoring and policy measures, the FSB is addressing risks from non-bank financial intermediation. And there has been remarkable progress on the difficult and unsung task of establishing workable resolution regimes that are consistent with the FSB's clearly defined principles.  Yes, we all have work to do to ensure full, timely, and consitent implementation of the agreed reforms, and, yes, we will do that work, but, it is time for the FSB to turn more of its energy and attention to the future. Tonight I would like to outline a few core principles that should guide this pivot forward. First, engagement: to maintain the legitimacy of our work, to increase understanding of it, and to enhance its effectiveness, we must improve our outreach and transparency--including to our membership, other global authorities, the public, and key stakeholders. Second, rigor: as we devote more attention to evaluation of new and evolving risks in the financial sector, we must ensure that our assessment of vulnerabilities is based on cutting-edge thinking and a disciplined methodology. And third, analysis: regulation has evolved rapidly in the last decade, and--if we are doing our jobs right--will continue to evolve with rapid developments in the financial sector. An important part of our work must be continual, critical analysis of the effects of regulaton with an eye to making useful improvements where possible. Let me begin with the principle of engagement, and let me lay the groundwork for this discussion by reviewing the way the FSB was established and its mandate, to see how we can continue to fulfill that mandate going forward. As we all know, the FSB was born out of the crucible of the 2007-09 Global Financial Crisis--a crisis that demonstrated in the starkest possible way the importance of global financial stability to the well-being of families and businesses around the world. In the months following the peak of the crisis, the world was struggling with financial market turmoil, and the resultant macroeconomic effects were felt by people everywhere around the world. It was clear that the response to this crisis needed to be global, and the G7 and G10, without any emerging market representation, were not the right  bodies to organize a global response. As such, the Heads of State and Government of the G20 called for the Financial Stability Forum (FSF), a relatively small and unmuscular group, to expand its membership and to strengthen its institutional framework. The result was the Financial Stability Board, which was designed as a mechanism for national authorities, global standards-setting bodies, and international authorities to identify and address vulnerabilities in the global financial system and to develop stronger regulatory and supervisory policies to create a more resilient global financial system. This new group is more representative of the interconnected global economy and financial system and can more effectively mobilize to promote global financial stability than anything that existed before. Whereas the FSF included only 11 jurisdictions (all of which were advanced economies), the FSB includes 24 jurisdictions and 73 representatives, which include all the members of the G20 and of which 10 are emerging market economies. In fostering global financial stability, the actions of the FSB have the potential to affect the global economy and financial system in important ways. Success in promoting global financial stability should benefit everybody, through more sustainable and stronger economic growth. At the same time, financial stability policy will also affect institutions and markets beyond the FSB's membership. Recognizing the wide-reaching effects of its work, the FSB must seek input from a broad range of stakeholders, each of whom brings a different perspective to the issues under consideration. While we are directly accountable to the G20, we are, through the G20, accountable to all of the people affected by our actions. In my view, that means we must engage in genuine, substantial dialogue with all of these stakeholders, to a greater and more effective degree than we have in the past.  Let me take an example that may be of particular relevance to many of you here tonight: our Regional Consultative Groups or RCGs. These are six groups around the globe--the Independent States, and Asia--that bring together FSB members with about 70 additional jurisdictions. These groups help the FSB get broader input into its policy development and improve our outreach efforts. Each RCG meets once or twice a year to discuss policy development, regional and global financial vulnerabilities, and other current topics of particular interest to the respective region. For instance, topics discussed at the last meeting in Asia included capital flow volatility, cyber resilience of financial institutions, and fintech. These RCGs are great in concept, but they have struggled in practice. We have already begun a study to look back at how the RCGs have operated since their creation in 2011, how they interact with the FSB, and what best practices have been learned. Even while that study is underway, I am committed to improving our mechanisms for reaching out to countries outside the FSB for genuine learning about the effects of FSB actions. I plan to attend a number of RCG meetings each year because of the importance I place on making sure these groups are truly useful tools, and we will improve these vital conduits of two-way information in order to improve our effectiveness and our transparency. While the RCGs may be of particular interest to some here tonight, they are just the tip of the iceberg for what we have to do to improve our engagement and outreach. Because the FSB's authority is ultimately derived from the people and from the political power given to authorities in their countries, we have a responsibility to seek input from and to provide information about our deliberations and actions to the broader public. To that end, for the first time in the FSB's  history, we will shortly publish our work program to the public to provide people with a full picture of the issues we are investigating over the coming year. Finally, there are the businesses, institutions, and market participants that are directly affected by the policy recommendations of the FSB. We currently engage with those entities to gather information as we consider recommendations to the G20. For example, we have in the past conducted public consultations on FSB policy recommendations--but often on a very short timetable, which limits the ability for true exchange. We have now established an expectation that the public consultation period will be at least 60 days. The key point is that when it comes to outreach to inform our work and transparency in the communication of it, we must do more, and more eagerly. This discussion of engagement, outreach and transparency may seem like an odd place to begin a ""vision"" speech, but I think it is foundational. The FSB must maintain its legitimacy in order to be effective, and to do that we have to work hard to hear from all relevant parties when deliberating. What's more, we have to do so publicly and methodically. Everyone around the world should understand that we only make recommendations once we have gathered and considered all points of view. Process is important, and good process leads to good substance. With that said, let me turn to the core piece of the FSB's mission--assessing and mitigating vulnerabilities, especially in the nonbank sector. The FSB's work has a natural flow. We strive to identify vulnerabilities in the financial system that could threaten financial stability when a shock hits. When a vulnerability has been identified, we examine possible policy responses. If a policy is recommended to the G20 and adopted, we then monitor the  implementation of that recommendation globally. Finally, when enough time has passed for the enacted policies to have had measurable effects, we study those effects. For much of the post-crisis period, our focus was on developing policy recommendations to address vulnerabilities made apparent by the crisis. Now, however, with nearly all of the post- crisis reform agenda complete, the FSB needs to put more of our resources into identifying new vulnerabilities in a financial sector that continues to evolve and to studying the effects of the many reforms that have been enacted. Let me start by discussing vulnerability assessment. The reforms that have been implemented over the past decade have changed the financial system for the better. However, that does not mean we are immune from future financial crises. It means that we have boosted the financial system's resilience to some of the types of shocks and vulnerabilities that precipitated the crisis. To be sure, some of these measures, like higher bank capital and liquidity requirements, after effective against a wide range of shocks. However, we cannot be complacent and assume that we are safe from all shocks. As a result, the FSB has decided to undertake a review of its framework for assessing vulnerabilities to ensure that we are at the cutting edge of financial stability vulnerability assessment. This work will be undertaken by our committee charged with assessing vulnerabilities Nederlandsche Bank). This should be a framework that starts from first principles and benefits from substantial dialogue with nonbanks as well as banks, regulators, and other relevant official bodies. There is a lot that we can draw on. The crisis led to an explosion of work in this area aimed at improving the ability of authorities to identify financial vulnerabilities in order to be able to take appropriate action in a timely fashion. I trust that the framework will harness the strength of the broad and diverse membership of the FSB, that it will be forward looking, and  that it will be flexible enough to handle a financial system that will continue to evolve over time. This will not be easy--developments like the emergence of crypto-assets may challenge any framework--but that makes the goal of a robust framework all the more important. Finally, let me turn to the FSB's evaluation of the effects of reforms that have been implemented. In the past few years, we have reached a point where many of the reforms have been in place for long enough to have effects that we can measure and analyze. For those reforms, we need to ask several key questions. First, to what extent are those reforms having the intended effects and building a more resilient financial system? Second, have those reforms had any unintended, adverse effects that we can address? These first two questions are, perhaps, apparent. We should also ask a third question, however, that is equally important: can we achieve a strong level of financial resilience with reforms that are more efficient, simple, transparent, and tailored? If so, we owe it to everyone affected by the policies recommended by the FSB to try, because there is a strong public interest in the efficiency of the financial sector, just as there is in its safety and soundness. If reforms are unnecessarily burdensome and we can achieve strong resiliency more efficiently and simply, we should be able to boost sustainable financial and economic activity, thus benefitting everyone. Evaluating reforms in light of these questions requires rigor--in terms of the selection of evaluation topics, the choice of analytical methods, the assessment of effects, and the development of policy conclusions. This rigor is critical for the quality and credibility of the evaluation work. For this reason, the FSB developed a clear Evaluation Framework, under which the evaluations are based, as much as possible, on quantitative data to measure the costs and benefits of reforms. Equally critical to a successful review is a truly open mindset with  which to evaluate the relevant data. One public measure of whether we are doing this review process well will be whether we recommend any improvements or revisions on the basis of it. In any system as complex and consequential as the body of post-crisis financial regulations, there will always be aspects--and sometimes material aspects--that can be improved on the basis of experience and analysis. A credible review process that is both rigorous and dispassionate will find a few. Last year, the FSB completed the first two evaluations under its framework, of the effects of reform on infrastructure fin ance and the clearing of derivative contracts. We are currently engaged in work examining the effects of reforms on the financing of small and medium enterprises, which are the lifeblood of many of the world's economies. We will consult publicly on the findings of this evaluation in June, ahead of the G20 Summit in Osaka. And we are in the process of launching an important study on the effects of reforms aimed at ending too big to fail. This evaluation is being led by Claudia Buch, vice president of the Deutsche Bundesbank. This is an important time for the FSB. We are nearing completion of the post-crisis reform agenda, a major accomplishment. With that comes the opportunity to turn our focus to ways in which we can improve the FSB and prepare it for the next phase of its existence. We will work diligently to enhance our transparency and to expand our efforts to reach out to as many stakeholders as possible. We will prepare for the next crisis by making sure that our framework to assess vulnerabilities to financial stability is state of the art and remains so going forward. And, we will work hard to maintain the important reforms in place, ensure they are working as intended, and, where possible, improve them.","['banks', 'bank', 'fsb', 'crises', 'regulation']","['global banks', 'fsb established', 'crisis regulation', 'bank financial', 'banks substantially']","['global banks substantially', 'nonbank sector fsb', 'resilient global financial', 'regimes consistent fsb', 'fsb authority ultimately']"
7667,r220708a_FOMC,united states,2022-07-08,Crypto-Assets and Decentralized Finance through a Financial Stability Lens,brainard,0,"Recent volatility has exposed serious vulnerabilities in the crypto financial system. While touted as a fundamental break from traditional finance, the crypto financial system turns out to be susceptible to the same risks that are all too familiar from traditional finance, such as leverage, settlement, opacity, and maturity and liquidity transformation. As we work to future-proof our financial stability agenda, it is important to ensure the regulatory perimeter encompasses crypto finance. New technology often holds the promise of increasing competition in the financial system, reducing transaction costs and settlement times, and channeling investment to productive new uses. But early on, new products and platforms are often fraught with risks, including fraud and manipulation, and it is important and sometimes difficult to distinguish between hype and value. If past innovation cycles are any guide, in order for distributed ledgers, smart contracts, programmability, and digital assets to fulfill their potential to bring competition, efficiency, and speed, it will be essential to address the basic risks that beset all forms of finance. These risks include runs, fire sales, deleveraging, interconnectedness, and contagion, along with fraud, manipulation, and evasion. In addition, it is important to be on the lookout for the possibility of new forms of risks, since many of the technological innovations underpinning the crypto ecosystem are relatively novel. Far from stifling innovation, strong regulatory guardrails will help enable investors and developers to build a resilient digital native financial infrastructure. Strong  regulatory guardrails will help banks, payments providers, and financial technology companies (FinTechs) improve the customer experience, make settlement faster, reduce costs, and allow for rapid product improvement and customization. We are closely monitoring recent events where risks in the system have crystallized and many crypto investors have suffered losses. Despite significant investor losses, the crypto financial system does not yet appear to be so large or so interconnected with the traditional financial system as to pose a systemic risk. So this is the right time to ensure that like risks are subject to like regulatory outcomes and like disclosure so as to help investors distinguish between genuine, responsible innovation and the false allure of seemingly easy returns that obscures significant risk. This is the right time to establish which crypto activities are permissible for regulated entities and under what constraints so that spillovers to the core financial system remain well contained. Several important insights have emerged from the recent turbulence in the crypto- finance ecosystem. First, volatility in financial markets has provided important information about crypto's performance as an asset class. It was already clear that crypto-assets are volatile, and we continue to see wild swings in crypto-asset values. The price of Bitcoin has dropped by as much as 75 percent from its all-time high over the past seven months, and it has declined almost 60 percent in the three months from April through June. Most other prominent crypto-assets have experienced even steeper declines over the same period. Contrary to claims that crypto-assets are a hedge to inflation or an uncorrelated asset class, crypto-assets have plummeted in value and have  proven to be highly correlated with riskier equities and with risk appetite more generally. Second, the Terra crash reminds us how quickly an asset that purports to maintain a stable value relative to fiat currency can become subject to a run. The collapse of Terra and the previous failures of several other unbacked algorithmic stablecoins are reminiscent of classic runs throughout history. New technology and financial engineering cannot by themselves convert risky assets into safe ones. Third, crypto platforms are highly vulnerable to deleveraging, fire sales, and contagion--risks that are well known from traditional finance--as illustrated by the freeze on withdrawals at some crypto lending platforms and exchanges and the bankruptcy of a prominent crypto hedge fund. Some retail investors have found their accounts frozen and suffered large losses. Large crypto players that used leverage to boost returns are scrambling to monetize their holdings, missing margin calls, and facing possible insolvency. As their distress intensifies, it has become clear that the crypto ecosystem is tightly interconnected, as many smaller traders, lenders, and DeFi (decentralized finance) protocols have concentrated exposures to these big players. Finally, we have seen how decentralized lending, which relies on overcollateralization to substitute for intermediation, can serve as a stress amplifier by creating waves of liquidations as prices fall.  The recent turbulence and losses among retail investors in crypto highlight the urgent need to ensure compliance with existing regulations and to fill any gaps where regulations or enforcement may need to be tailored--for instance, for decentralized protocols and platforms. As we consider how to address the potential future financial stability risks of the evolving crypto financial system, it is important to start with strong basic regulatory foundations. A good macroprudential framework builds on a solid foundation of microprudential regulation. Future financial resilience will be greatly enhanced if we ensure the regulatory perimeter encompasses the crypto financial system and reflects the principle of same risk, same disclosure, same regulatory outcome. By extending the perimeter and applying like regulatory outcomes and like transparency to like risks, it will enable regulators to more effectively address risks within crypto markets and potential risks posed by crypto markets to the broader financial system. Strong guardrails for safety and soundness, market integrity, and investor and consumer protection will help ensure that new digital finance products, platforms, and activities are based on genuine economic value and not on regulatory evasion, which ultimately leaves investors more exposed than they may appreciate. Due to the cross-sectoral and cross-border scope of crypto platforms, exchanges, and activities, it is important that regulators work together domestically and internationally to maintain a stable financial system and address regulatory evasion. The same-risk-same-regulatory-outcome principle guides the Financial Stability Board's work on stablecoins, crypto-assets, and DeFi; the Basel consultation on the prudential treatment of crypto-assets; the work by the International Organization of Securities  Commissions' FinTech network; the work by federal bank regulatory agencies on the appropriate treatment of crypto activities at U.S. banks; and a host of other international and domestic work. In implementing a same-risk-same-regulatory-outcome principle, we should start by ensuring basic protections are in place for consumers and investors. Retail users should be protected against exploitation, undisclosed conflicts of interest, and market manipulation--risks to which they are particularly vulnerable, according to a host of research. If investors lack these basic protections, these markets will be vulnerable to runs. Second, since trading platforms play a critical role in crypto-asset markets, it is important to address noncompliance and any gaps that may exist. We have seen crypto- trading platforms and crypto-lending firms not only engage in activities similar to those in traditional finance without comparable regulatory compliance, but also combine  activities that are required to be separated in traditional financial markets. For example, some platforms combine market infrastructure and client facilitation with risk-taking businesses like asset creation, proprietary trading, venture capital, and lending. Third, all financial institutions, whether in traditional finance or crypto finance, must comply with the rules designed to combat money laundering and financing of terrorism and to support economic sanctions. Platforms and exchanges should be designed in a manner that facilitates and supports compliance with these laws. The permissionless exchange of assets and tools that obscure the source of funds not only facilitate evasion, but also increase the risk of theft, hacks, and ransom attacks. These risks are particularly prominent in decentralized exchanges that are designed to avoid the use of intermediaries responsible for know-your-customer identification and that may require adaptations to ensure compliance at this most foundational layer. Finally, it is important to address any regulatory gaps and to adapt existing approaches to novel technologies. While regulatory frameworks clearly apply to DeFi activities no less than to centralized crypto activities and traditional finance, DeFi protocols may present novel challenges that may require adapting existing approaches. The peer-to-peer nature of these activities, their automated nature, the immutability of code once deployed to the blockchain, the exercise of governance functions through tokens in decentralized autonomous organizations, the absence of validated identities, and  the dispersion or obfuscation of control may make it challenging to hold intermediaries accountable. It is not yet clear that digital native approaches, such as building in automated incentives for undertaking governance responsibilities, are adequate alternatives. There are two specific areas that merit heightened attention because of heightened risks of spillovers to the core financial system: bank involvement in crypto activities and stablecoins. To date, crypto has not become sufficiently interconnected with the core financial system to pose broad systemic risk. But it is likely regulators will continue to face calls for supervised banking institutions to play a role in these markets. Bank regulators will need to weigh competing considerations in assessing bank involvement in crypto activities ranging from custody to issuance to customer facilitation. Bank involvement provides an interface where regulators have strong sightlines and can help ensure strong protections. Similarly, regulators are drawn to approaches that effectively subject the crypto intermediaries that resemble complex bank organizations to bank-like regulation. But bringing risks from crypto into the heart of the financial system without the appropriate guardrails could increase the potential for spillovers and has uncertain implications for the stability of the system. It is important for banks to engage with beneficial innovation and upgrade capabilities in digital finance, but until there is a strong regulatory framework for crypto finance, bank involvement might further entrench a riskier and less compliant ecosystem.  Stablecoins represent a second area with a heightened risk of spillovers. Currently, stablecoins are positioned as the digital native asset that bridges from the crypto financial system to fiat. This role is important because fiat currency is referenced as the unit of account for the crypto financial system. Stablecoins are currently the settlement asset of choice on and across crypto platforms, often serving as collateral for lending and trading activity. As highlighted by large recent outflows from the largest stablecoin, stablecoins pegged to fiat currency are highly vulnerable to runs. For these reasons, it is vital that stablecoins that purport to be redeemable at par in fiat currency on demand are subject to the types of prudential regulation that limit the risk of runs and payment system vulnerabilities that such private monies have exhibited historically. Well-regulated stablecoins might bring additional competition to payments, but they introduce other risks. There is a risk of fragmentation of stablecoin networks into walled gardens. Conversely, there is a risk that a single dominant stablecoin might emerge, given the winner-takes-all dynamics in such activities. Indeed, the market is currently highly concentrated among three dominant stablecoins, and it risks becoming even more concentrated in the future. The top three stablecoins account for almost 90 percent of transactions, and the top two of these account for 80 percent of market capitalization.  Given the foundational role of fiat currency, there may be an advantage for future financial stability to having a digital native form of safe central bank money--a central bank digital currency. A digital native form of safe central bank money could enhance stability by providing the neutral trusted settlement layer in the future crypto financial system. A settlement layer with a digital native central bank money could, for instance, facilitate interoperability among well-regulated stablecoins designed for a variety of use cases and enable private-sector provision of decentralized, customized, and automated financial products. This development would be a natural evolution of the complementarity between the public and private sectors in payments, ensuring strong public trust in the one-for-one redeemability of commercial bank money and stablecoins for safe central bank money. Crypto and fintech have introduced competition and put the focus on how innovation can help increase inclusion and address other vexing problems in finance today. Slow and costly payments particularly affect lower-income households with precarious cash flows who rely on remittances or miss bills waiting on paychecks. Many hard-working individuals cannot obtain credit to start businesses or to respond to an emergency.  But while innovation and competition can reduce costs in finance, some costs are necessary to keep the system safe. Intermediaries earn revenues in exchange for safely providing important services. Someone must bear the costs of evaluating risk, maintaining resources to support those risks through good times and bad, complying with laws that prevent crime and terrorism, and serving less sophisticated customers fairly and without exploitation. In the current crypto ecosystem, often no one is bearing these costs. So when a service appears cheaper or more efficient, it is important to understand whether this benefit is due to genuine innovation or regulatory noncompliance. So as these activities evolve, it is worth considering whether there are new ways to achieve regulatory objectives in the context of new technology. Distributed ledgers, smart contracts, and digital identities may allow new forms of risk management that shift the distribution of costs. Perhaps in a more decentralized financial system, new approaches can be designed to make protocol developers and transaction validators accountable for ensuring financial products are safe and compliant. Innovation has the potential to make financial services faster, cheaper, and more inclusive and to do so in ways that are native to the digital ecosystem. Enabling responsible innovation to flourish will require that the regulatory perimeter encompass the crypto financial system according to the principle of like risk, like regulatory outcome, and that novel risks associated with the new technologies be appropriately addressed. It is important that the foundations for sound regulation of the crypto  financial system be established now before the crypto ecosystem becomes so large or interconnected that it might pose risks to the stability of the broader financial system.","['crypto', 'securities', 'finance', 'financial', 'fintech']","['finance crypto', 'crypto finance', 'risks crypto', 'crypto financial', 'future crypto']","['vulnerabilities crypto financial', 'evolving crypto financial', 'future crypto financial', 'risks evolving crypto', 'crypto finance new']"
