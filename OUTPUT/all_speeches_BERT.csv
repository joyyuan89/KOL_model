6114,r220620a_BOE,united kingdom,2022-06-20,UK monetary policy in the context of global spillovers,mann,0,"Welcome to this presentation of the May . The main development since our last in February has been Russia's unprovoked and illegal invasion of Ukraine. The Bank of England condemns Russia's actions and the suffering inflicted on Ukraine. The Bank is working closely with the UK Government to support its response in coordination with international authorities. Global inflationary pressures have intensified sharply in the build up to and following the invasion. This has led to a material deterioration in the outlook for world growth. Concerns about further supply chain disruption have also risen, both due to the invasion and to Covid developments in China. These developments have exacerbated greatly the challenges already facing the UK, and many other economies, from the series of adverse supply shocks we continue to face. Monetary policy must, therefore, navigate a narrow path between the increased risks from elevated inflation and a tight labour market on one hand, and the further hit to activity from the reduction in real incomes on the other. While these shocks are global in nature, there are important differences in the way they are impacting different economies. To characterise the situation, the United States is facing what looks like a demand shock, with a strong domestic labour market, strong domestic demand and relatively less exposure to the energy price shock given its position as a major gas producer. The euro area by contrast is facing a supply/cost shock, as it starts with a somewhat weaker domestic labour market, and is heavily exposed to the rise in gas prices. In the UK we are seeing elements of both. Like the euro area, we are experiencing a sharp terms of trade shock emanating from the rise in the price of tradable goods and energy. But our strong labour market is more akin to that in the US. The outlook for inflation Turning to our latest projections, this is a forecast of two halves: with inflation well-above target in the near term, but subsequently falling back to end the forecast below the target, as global inflationary pressures fall sharply and domestic activity weakens. This is similar in nature to our February forecast, although developments since then have increased the size of these swings. In line with the MPC's conventions, the projections are conditioned on a market-implied path for Bank Rate that rises to around 2 1/2 % by mid-2023, 1.1 percentage points higher than in February, before falling to 2% at the end of the forecast period. Wholesale energy prices are assumed to follow their respective futures curves for the first six months of the projections and remain constant beyond that. Given that path for wholesale prices and Ofgem's published method for calculating the retail gas and electricity price caps, Bank staff currently forecast that household energy prices would rise by a further 40% in October. UK CPI inflation rose to 7.0% in March. The strength of inflation relative to the 2% target mainly reflects previous large increases in global energy and tradable goods prices, owing to the build up to and subsequent Russian invasion of Ukraine, and to the continuing effects of the pandemic on the pattern of global demand and disruption to global supply chains. In the MPC's central projection, CPI inflation is expected to rise over the remainder of the year, averaging slightly over 10% at its peak in 2022 Q4. The majority of that further increase reflects higher household energy prices. The price cap mechanism means that it takes some time for changes in wholesale gas and electricity prices to be reflected in retail energy prices. That means consumer price inflation is likely to peak later in the United Kingdom than in many other economies, and may therefore fall back later. Though responsible for less of the current and projected rise in inflation, domestic inflationary pressures have also increased. The Labour Force Survey unemployment rate fell to 3.8% in the three months to February, consistent with a continuing tightening in the labour market. Underlying nominal earnings growth has risen to around 4 to 4 1/2 % and is expected to strengthen further in coming months to average 5 3/4 % in 2022, given the further tightening of the labour market and some upward pressure on wage growth from higher price inflation. Consistent with this, there has been some increase in the inflation rates of more domestically supplied services. UK GDP growth is expected to slow sharply over the first half of the forecast period. That predominantly reflects the significant adverse impact of the sharp rises in global energy and tradable goods prices on most UK households' real incomes. It is a measure of the scale of the shock that total real household disposable income is projected to fall by 1 3/4 % in 2022 which, apart from 2011, would be the largest contraction since comparable records began in 1964. I recognise the hardship this will cause for many people in the UK, particularly those on the lowest incomes, often with little or no savings, who are hit hardest by increases in the prices of basic necessities like food and energy. As a result of the associated decline in activity, although the unemployment rate is likely to fall further in the near term to 3.6% in Q2, it is projected to rise to 5 1/2 % in three years' time given the sharp slowdown in activity. With monetary policy acting to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations are anchored at the 2% target, upward pressure on CPI inflation is, therefore, expected to dissipate over time. Global commodity prices are assumed to be consistent with the conditioning paths for energy prices and so rise no further in the central projection. Global bottlenecks are expected to ease over time, and the weakening in growth and building excess supply leads domestic inflationary pressures to subside. Once CPI inflation starts to fall, it is projected to fall relatively quickly; to a little above the 2% target in two years' time, largely reflecting the waning influence of external factors, and to 1.3% in three years, well below the target and mainly reflecting weaker domestic pressures. The risks to the inflation projection are judged to be skewed to the upside at these points, given the risks of more persistent strength in nominal wage growth and domestic price setting than we have assumed. The policy decision I will now turn to the monetary policy decision. The MPC's remit is clear that the inflation target applies at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework also recognises that there will be occasions when inflation will depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. The economy has recently been subject to a succession of very large shocks. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is another such shock. In particular, should the current very elevated levels of global energy and tradable goods prices prove persistent, this will necessarily weigh further on most UK households' real incomes and many UK companies' profit margins. This is something monetary policy is unable to prevent. But what monetary policy can do is to ensure that, as this real economic adjustment occurs, it does so in a manner consistent with achieving the 2% inflation target sustainably in the medium term, while minimising undesirable volatility in output. Recent developments have exacerbated materially both the near-term peak in CPI inflation, and the prospective negative impact on activity and medium-term inflationary pressures. Nevertheless, given the current tightness of the labour market, continuing signs of robust domestic cost and price pressures, and the risk that those pressures will persist, the Committee voted at this meeting to increase Bank Rate by a further 0.25 percentage points to 1%. Based on their updated assessment of the economic outlook, most members of the Committee judge that some degree of further tightening in monetary policy might still be appropriate in the coming months. There are risks on both sides of that judgement and a range of views among these members on the balance of risks. The MPC will continue to review developments in the light of incoming data and their implications for medium-term inflation. Given the uncertainty around the outlook, it is unsurprising there were a range of views amongst members of the committee about the extent of tightening required at this meeting and in the coming months. This reflects the narrow path we are navigating, given the magnitude of the risks on both sides of our inflation projections. Reflecting the risks on one side of that narrow path, at this meeting three members preferred a 0.5 percentage point increase in Bank Rate. Reflecting the risks on the other side, however, there were also a range of views about the need for, and extent of, any further tightening in policy in the coming months. While most members judged that some degree of further tightening might still be appropriate, some members judged that the risks around activity and inflation over the policy horizon were more evenly balanced and that such guidance was not appropriate at this juncture. Finally, the MPC is providing further information on unwinding the stock of assets previously purchased as part of the QE programmes. As Bank Rate is being increased to 1%, and consistent with the MPC's previous guidance, the Committee will now consider beginning the process of selling UK government bonds held in the Asset Purchase Facility. The Committee recognises the benefits of providing market participants with clarity on the framework for any potential sales programme. The MPC has therefore asked Bank staff to work on a strategy for UK government bond sales, and will provide an update at our August meeting. This will allow the Committee to make a decision at a subsequent meeting on whether to commence sales. I should reiterate that no decision on whether to commence sales has yet been made. The Committee reaffirmed that that decision will depend on economic circumstances including market conditions at the time, and that sales would be expected to be conducted in a gradual and predictable manner so as not to disrupt the functioning of financial markets.

Ben, Dave and I will be happy to take your questions.","['inflation', 'inflationary', 'shocks', 'monetary', 'economy']","['shocks russia', 'shocks global', 'supply shocks', 'demand shock', 'uk monetary']","['large shocks russia', 'shocks russia invasion', 'shocks global nature', 'supply shocks continue', 'domestic inflationary pressures']","['domestic inflationary pressures', 'demand shock', 'global inflationary pressures', 'adverse supply shocks', 'energy price shock']"
3220,r220620a_ECB,euro area,2022-06-20,Hearing of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament,lagarde,1,"It is a pleasure to be here again for our second regular hearing this year and my first in Brussels since the start of the pandemic two years ago. The economic and geopolitical landscape facing Europe has changed dramatically following the unjustified aggression by Russia towards Ukraine. Over the past few weeks and months, Europe - thanks also to the work of this Parliament - has responded forcefully by imposing sanctions and implementing measures to reduce its dependence on Russia and to cushion the economic impact of the war. Over the same period, the conditions facing monetary policy have changed markedly. At our June meeting we therefore decided to take further steps in normalising our monetary policy. Let me start by discussing our updated assessment of the outlook before going on to explain our decisions in greater detail. In view of the new rules that require me to give a shorter introductory statement, I will only be able to present a few elements of our assessment and decisions taken at our meeting on 8-9 June 2022. Euro area activity is being dampened by high energy costs, intensified supply disruptions and greater uncertainty, which affect the manufacturing sector in particular. At the same time, activity in the services sector is supporting growth and the recovery in this sector is expected to strengthen over the coming months. The lifting of pandemic-related restrictions and good prospects for the tourist season are driving stronger activity, particularly in contact-intensive services. Moreover, a strong labour market, with more people in jobs, will continue to support incomes and consumption. The headwinds from high energy costs, the deterioration in the terms of trade, greater uncertainty and the adverse impact of high inflation on disposable income are expected to gradually fade. As a result, our latest Eurosystem staff projections see growth of 2.8% in 2022 and 2.1% in both 2023 and 2024. Looking at inflation, it has risen further, standing at 8.1% in May. Energy prices stand 39.2% above their levels one year ago. Food prices rose 7.5% in May, in part reflecting the importance of Ukraine and Russia among the main global producers of agricultural goods. Prices have also gone up more strongly because of renewed supply bottlenecks amid recovering domestic demand, especially in the services sector, as our economy reopens. As a result, price rises are becoming more widespread across sectors and measures of underlying inflation have risen further. Wage growth has started to pick up, although it remains moderate. We expect negotiated wage growth to strengthen slightly further over 2022 and then to remain above average levels for the projection horizon, supported by tight labour markets, increases in minimum wages and some effects of compensation for the high rates of inflation. These developments are reflected in longer-term inflation expectations, which have increased, with most measures derived from financial markets and from expert surveys standing at around 2%. Initial signs of above-target revisions to these measures, however, warrant close monitoring. The baseline inflation projections by Eurosystem staff have been revised up significantly. These projections indicate that inflation will remain undesirably elevated for some time. They foresee annual inflation at 6.8% in 2022 before it is projected to decline to 3.5% in 2023 and 2.1% in 2024. This means that headline inflation at the end of the projection horizon is projected to be slightly above our target. The current inflation environment - with figures well above our target - clearly poses a challenge. That's why at its 8-9 June meeting the Governing Council expressed its unwavering commitment to bring inflation back to its medium-term target of 2%. With this in mind, and on the basis of the updated assessment I have just outlined, we decided at that meeting to take further steps in normalising our monetary policy. First, we decided to end net asset purchases under our asset purchase programme (APP) as of 1 July 2022. Second, as the Governing Council concluded that the conditions underlying our forward guidance have been satisfied, we intend to raise the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points at our July monetary policy meeting. Third, looking further ahead, we expect to raise the key ECB interest rates again in September. The calibration of this rate increase will depend on the updated medium-term inflation outlook. If the medium-term inflation outlook persists or deteriorates, a larger increment will be appropriate at our September meeting. And fourth, beyond September, based on our current assessment, we anticipate that a gradual but sustained path of further increases in interest rates will be appropriate. In line with our commitment to our 2% medium-term target, the pace at which we adjust our monetary policy will depend on the incoming data and how we assess inflation to develop in the medium term. Since the gradual process of policy normalisation was initiated in December 2021, we have pledged to act against resurgent fragmentation risks. The pandemic has left lasting vulnerabilities in the euro area economy which are indeed contributing to the uneven transmission of the normalisation of our monetary policy across jurisdictions. Based on this assessment, on 15 June we decided that we will apply flexibility in reinvesting redemptions coming due in the PEPP portfolio, with a view to preserving the functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism, a precondition for the ECB to be able to deliver on its price stability mandate. In addition, we decided to mandate the relevant Eurosystem committees together with the ECB services to accelerate the completion of the design of a new anti-fragmentation instrument for consideration by the Governing Council. These decisions underpin our previous commitments to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate, incorporating flexibility if warranted, to ensure that inflation stabilises at our 2% target over the medium term. To conclude, Russia's unjustified aggression towards Ukraine is severely affecting the euro area economy and the outlook is still surrounded by high uncertainty. But the conditions are in place for the economy to continue to grow and to recover further over the medium term. Fiscal policy is helping to cushion the impact of the war and governments have intervened to slow energy inflation. Alongside targeted fiscal policies, the implementation of the Next Generation EU programme, the ""Fit for 55"" package and the REPowerEU plan should also help the euro area economy. I count on the work of this Parliament to ensure that these important EU initiatives can actively contribute to forging a sustainable growth path and increasing the EU's resilience to shocks. Thank you. I now stand ready to take your questions.","['euro', 'eurosystem', 'monetary', 'brussels', 'sanctions']","['affecting euro', 'monetary policy', 'relevant eurosystem', 'help euro', 'vulnerabilities euro']","['facing monetary policy', 'severely affecting euro', 'functioning monetary policy', 'normalisation monetary policy', 'affecting euro area']","['monetary policy', 'monetary policy meeting', 'euro area activity', 'relevant eurosystem committees', 'euro area economy']"
279,r220621a_BOA,australia,2022-06-21,        Inflation and Monetary Policy,lowe,1,"I would like to thank AMCHAM for the invitation to speak today. It is a pleasure to be here. It is a challenging time in the global economy. Most countries, including the United States and Australia, are experiencing the highest rates of inflation for many years. The tragic events in Ukraine have led to sharp increases in the prices of food and energy. And interest rates are rising around the world from the record lows during the pandemic. All this is happening at a time when unemployment rates are as low as they have been for many decades and household budgets are under pressure. So, it is a complex policy environment. Today, I would like to begin by focusing on the recent inflation data and the outlook for inflation. I will then turn to how monetary policy is responding to the higher inflation. I would also like to share with you some of the observations from the Reserve Bank Board's review of the yield target, which was published earlier this morning. This review is one element of a broader set of reviews the Board is undertaking of our pandemic response. We want to be transparent and open, and to learn lessons for the future. First to inflation. The rise in inflation is a global story - it is occurring everywhere (Graph 1). In the United States and Europe, inflation is above 8 per cent and the peak has not yet been reached in some countries. Inflation has also picked up across Asia, although it is lower there than in the North Atlantic. Japan is a notable standout; while inflation in Japan has picked up, it is only just above 2 per cent. Australia is no exception to the general trend, although inflation here remains below that of most other advanced economies. In headline terms, inflation in Australia was 5.1 per cent over the year to the March quarter, which is the highest rate in many years (Graph 2). In underlying terms, the inflation rate was 3.7 per cent, which is higher than it has been in recent years, but still lower than it was during the resources boom. In both headline and underlying terms, inflation is much higher than we had earlier expected. The fact that inflation is higher everywhere tells us that there are powerful global factors at work. During the pandemic, supply chains were interrupted around the world, delivery times were pushed out and firms' costs of production rose. The inevitable result has been higher prices. And on top of this, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has caused major disruptions to the global markets for energy and food. As a result, oil prices have increased by 28 per cent since February and global food prices, including the prices of wheat and vegetable oils, have increased sharply (Graph 3). There has also been strong growth in demand globally, supported by stimulatory fiscal and monetary policy around the world. When major events like these occur, it simply isn't possible to insulate ourselves here in Australia from their effects. We live in an interconnected world and big shocks in global markets affect our domestic markets and the prices that we pay. Petrol prices in Australia are up by 37 per cent over the past year, which alone is adding around 1 percentage point to headline inflation (Graph 4). Another example where disruptions to global production are having an effect in Australia is the price of new cars, which has increased at the fastest rate for many years. As important as these global influences are, they do not provide a full explanation for higher inflation in Australia. Increasingly, domestic factors are also at play. Following the strong recovery from the pandemic, growth in domestic spending is now testing the ability of the economy to meet the demand for goods and services. This is particularly evident in the labour market, with many firms reporting that the availability of labour is a significant constraint on their ability to operate and/or expand (Graph 5). Many parts of the construction sector are also operating at, or close to, full capacity. And some public infrastructure investment is being delayed or scaled back because of capacity constraints. Not surprisingly, this pressure on domestic capacity has led to a broadening of inflation pressures in Australia. Reflecting this, the share of items in the CPI basket with annualised price increases of more than 3 per cent is at the highest level since 1990 (Graph 6). When the RBA published its latest set of forecasts in early May, we expected that inflation would peak at around 6 per cent at the end of this year. The information available since then has led us to push this forecast peak higher. Since early May, petrol prices have risen further due to global developments and the outlooks for retail electricity and gas prices have been revised higher due to pressures on capacity in that sector. As a result, we are now expecting inflation to peak at around 7 per cent in the December quarter. Following this, by early next year, we expect that inflation will begin to decline. I would like to highlight three factors that lie behind this assessment that inflation will moderate next year. The first is that some of the pandemic-related supply-side problems in the global economy are gradually being resolved. Firms have been adjusting to their new operating environment and solving the problems in global production and logistic networks - as a result, delivery times have shortened a little from last year, the prices of semiconductors have declined from their recent peak and the global production of cars is showing signs of a recovery (Graph 7). While it is still possible there will be further setbacks, the global production system is adjusting and this should help lessen some of the inflationary pressures. The second factor is a more technical one, but one that we should not lose sight of. It is important to remember that inflation is the rate of change of prices. It is not a measure of the level of prices. This means that for inflation to stay high, prices have to keep increasing at an elevated rate; if prices simply remain steady at a high level, the rate of inflation falls to zero. As an example of this, if global oil prices were to stay at the current elevated level, the annual rate of increase in oil prices would fall from 66 per cent to zero per cent. This might not be of much comfort to people struggling with the current high level of prices, but it would mean that the rate of measured inflation would decline. The third factor that provides confidence that inflation will decline is the tightening of monetary policy that is underway around the world, including here in Australia. The higher interest rates globally will help to create a more sustainable balance between the demand for goods and services and the ability of our economies to meet that demand. Achieving that balance is not straightforward and there are risks involved, but higher interest rates will lessen the current inflationary pressures. This brings me to the Reserve Bank Board's recent decisions. In May, the Board increased the cash rate target by 25 basis points and, in June, by a further 50 basis points (Graph 8). These were the first increases in the cash rate since 2010. The Board judged that, given the inflation data and outlook that I have just discussed, it was no longer appropriate for interest rates in Australia to remain at the COVID-emergency levels. The increase in the cash rate in May followed the higher-than-expected CPI outcome in the March quarter and evidence from business surveys and our own liaison that growth in labour costs had picked up and would continue to do so in the months ahead. In June, we decided to make a bigger, 50 basis points, adjustment on the basis of the additional information suggesting a further upward revision to an already high inflation forecast. The Board also gave consideration to the fact that the level of interest rates was still very low. The Board is committed to doing what is necessary to ensure that inflation returns to the 2 to 3 per cent target range over time. High inflation damages the economy, reduces the purchasing power of people's incomes and devalues people's savings. It is also regressive, hurting most those who are least well equipped to protect themselves. So it is important that we chart our way back to an inflation rate in the 2 to 3 per cent target range. We do not need to, nor can we, get there immediately. Australia has long had a flexible mediumterm inflation target, which, by design, can accommodate deviations of inflation from target. For a number of years inflation was below target and now it is above. What is important here is that we chart a credible path back to an inflation rate of 2 to 3 per cent. That path will be easier to navigate if the inflation psychology in Australia does not shift too much. A lesson from the 1970s is that if an inflation shock shifts people's expectations about the ongoing rate of inflation, it becomes harder to reverse. Applying this lesson to today, it is important that the higher rate of inflation this year does not feed through into ongoing inflation expectations. If it did, the period of higher inflation would persist and it would be more costly to reverse. To date, mediumterm inflation expectations have been well anchored at around 2 to 3 per cent, suggesting that people believe we will get back to target. We want to do what we can to make sure this remains the case. Higher interest rates have a role to play here, by helping ensure that spending grows broadly in line with the economy's capacity to produce goods and services. Higher interest rates can also directly affect expectations by demonstrating the commitment of the RBA to return inflation to target. As we chart our way back to 2 to 3 per cent inflation, Australians should be prepared for more interest rate increases. The level of interest rates is still very low for an economy with low unemployment and that is experiencing high inflation. I want to emphasise though that we are not on a pre-set path. How fast we increase interest rates, and how far we need to go, will be guided by the incoming data and the Board's assessment of the outlook for inflation and the labour market. As we make that assessment each month, the Board will be paying close attention to developments in the global economy, the evolution of labour costs and how household spending is responding to higher interest rates. The recent news on household spending has been broadly positive, with spending bouncing back following the Omicron setback. Household balance sheets are generally in good shape, with households overall having accumulated more than $200 billion in additional savings during the pandemic. Furthermore, the current rate of saving out of income remains materially higher than it was before the pandemic, so there is a degree of flexibility in many household budgets. It is also relevant that strong employment growth is continuing and that there are many job opportunities at the moment. However, on the other side of the ledger, many households have not previously experienced a period of rising interest rates. Households are also experiencing a decline in real incomes because of the higher inflation and some of the large gains in housing prices over recent years are being unwound. Given these various considerations, we will be watching household spending carefully as we chart our way back to 2 to 3 per cent inflation. I would now like to shift gear and turn to the review of the yield target, which the RBA released earlier this morning. First, some background. As part of its pandemic response in March 2020, the RBA implemented a target for the yield on three-year Australian Government bonds. At the time, the target was 25 basis points. This target was part of a comprehensive package designed to lower funding costs in Australia and support the supply of credit. The Board chose to directly target the yield on three-year government bonds, rather than implement a program of bond purchases. It judged that, in the circumstances of the time, this was a more direct way of influencing the interest rates that matter most to the cost of finance in Australia. The target was lowered from 25 basis points to 10 basis points in November 2020 and was discontinued a year later, in November 2021. For most of the time the target was in operation, the RBA did not need to buy bonds to achieve the target, although there were a few episodes when we entered the market to keep the three-year yield consistent with the target (Graph 9). All up, the RBA purchased around $36 billion of three-year bonds in support of the target. The review published this morning discusses the main decision points and lessons from this experience. It concludes that the yield target was successful in lowering funding costs and supporting credit provision. In doing this, it helped the economy recover from the pandemic. But these benefits came with complications. If similar circumstances were to arise in the future, the Board would likely make different choices, although it has not ruled out using a yield target again in some form. Given the yield target was part of a policy package, it is difficult to disentangle its specific contribution to the declines in the interest rates faced by households and businesses. But following the introduction of the target, lending rates fell considerably, especially fixed rates. Indeed, banks lowered the interest rates for their three-year fixed-rate loans to be well below the new variable rate for the first time and the fixed-rate share of new housing lending rose to new highs (Graph 10). This helped support the housing market and household finances during the pandemic. One particular feature of the yield target that the review draws attention to is that it was construed as a form of time-based guidance. This interpretation was reinforced by the Bank's communication that, in the central scenario, policy interest rates were unlikely to be increased until 2024. This time- based element of our communication was helpful in the dark days of the pandemic, sending a strong message that the RBA would provide the support that was needed. But the yield target was not a flexible policy instrument as times changed. It also created a communication challenge given that the Board's decisions were, in fact, dependent upon the state of the economy, not the calendar. As the health situation improved and the economy turned out much better than expected, the yield target became a less effective policy. Other market interest rates for similar terms moved away from the yield on three-year government bonds, limiting the transmission of the target to the real economy. This was in contrast to the first phase of the pandemic, when the target was closely aligned with market interest rates. The review also draws attention to the fact that the Board maintained a very strong focus in its decision-making on insuring against downside risks. At the time the target was adopted, there were credible forecasts that tens of thousands of Australians would die, the demand for hospital beds would exceed capacity and a vaccine would be years away. The unemployment rate was expected to reach double-digit levels and there were fears that there would be deep economic scarring and a generation of Australians would face lost opportunity. In this environment, the Board was very concerned about downside risks to the economy. It sought to provide insurance against these potentially very bad outcomes, and the yield target was part of this. It certainly recognised that things could turn out better than expected, but its priority was guarding against the downside. This was on the basis that if the downside did prevail, the costs to our society and our economy would be very high and there would be little further scope for the Bank to respond. On the other hand, if the worst outcomes were avoided and the upside prevailed, the policy could be adjusted, as it ultimately was. The review discusses various decision points and the different decisions that could have been made at these points. With hindsight, it can be argued that there was too much focus on the downside risks to the economy and the need to insure against them, and too little focus on the possibility that things could work out better than expected. But in real time, in which decisions had to be made under great uncertainty, the review notes that the focus on the downside risks was understandable. The Board recognises that opinions will differ as to whether it struck the right balance. As part of its review, the Board has agreed to strengthen its scenario analysis in future decision- making. It also recognises that the way the target ended in late 2021 was disorderly and caused some reputational damage to the Bank. It accepts that earlier communication from the Bank could have eased the situation, although the end of a target that was losing credibility was always likely to generate some volatility in market prices. The Board has not ruled out using a yield target again in extreme circumstances, but views the probability of doing so as low. The use of a yield target in some form would need to be evaluated against other policy options, including a bond purchase program. Such a program offers more flexibility, but it does carry other risks. These include larger potential financial costs for the central bank and the possibility of impaired bond market functioning as central bank bond holdings increase. There can also be challenges in unwinding a large bond purchase program. To assist with its future policy choices and to learn further lessons from recent experience, the Board will undertake a review of Australia's experience with the bond purchase program later this year. It will also undertake a review of the Bank's approach to forward guidance. Consistent with our commitment to transparency and accountability, these reviews will also be published.

3222,r220622a_ECB,euro area,2022-06-22,"Good, bad and hopeful news: the latest on the supervision of climate risks",elderson,0,"I understand that today's audience includes managers and experts from banks and banking associations, supervisors, academics and students. So this is an ideal platform for exchanging views on the financial sector's role in addressing the risks of the ongoing climate and environmental crises. Conferences like these are a chance to inform each other of what we are doing and to share the knowledge and expertise we are accumulating to gear ourselves to a world that is already undergoing a climate crisis. Physical and transition risks from climate change and environmental degradation are already materialising all around us. Today I will update you on the recent progress on both the international agenda and the ECB's own supervisory agenda on climate-related and environmental risks, or C&E risks for short. I will share some preliminary findings from our review of how banks incorporate C&E risks into their risk management practices. There will be good, bad and hopeful news. The good news is that, one year after my first on the state of C&E risk management by euro area banks as Vice-Chair of the ECB's Supervisory Board, banks are starting to progress in their management of these risks. The bad news is that this progress is not across the board, and laggards remain in all areas. But there is hopeful news too. The silver lining is that the state-of-the-art governance and risk management practices now being adopted by some banks confirm that what the ECB is asking is possible. We just need all banks to do it. All around the world, there is a growing consensus on the urgency of dealing with the climate and environmental crises. For banks, the prominence of C&E risks is significant, too. During various supervisory exercises recently conducted by the ECB, most banks recognised that they have significant exposures to these risks, which they expected to materialise in the short to medium term. And we see that banks are consequently allocating more and more financial and human resources to managing these risks. And this is what supervisors around the world expect from banks. Just last week, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the main global standard-setter for the prudential regulation of banks, published its "" These principles have been prepared in a Basel Committee task force that I co-chair. They are a major milestone, as it means that supervisors from all around the world now unanimously confirm not only that climate risks may be material, but also that both banks and supervisors urgently need to contend with them. The Basel Committee backed this up by announcing it expects implementation of these principles as soon as possible and that it will monitor progress in these fields across its member jurisdictions. Importantly, the Basel Committee's principles promote many of the practices that the ECB had signalled as crucial for the proper management of C&E risks. For instance, they emphasise the importance of assessing the materiality of climate risks and considering their potential impact on banks' business models. They also highlight the need to fully incorporate material risks into banks' own internal capital and liquidity adequacy assessment processes. Moreover, the principles expect a bank's board and senior management to ensure that the bank's internal strategies and risk appetite statements are consistent with any publicly communicated climate-related strategies and commitments. This expectation comes at a timely moment as more and more banks publicly commit to aligning their financing activities with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. Failing to meet their commitments may expose these banks to a number of risks, including reputational risks as well as any potential prudential risks of misalignment with these objectives. This is particularly true for jurisdictions, such as the European Union, which have binding climate targets. Addressed to both banks and supervisors, these principles seek to improve, on the one hand, banks' risk management and, on the other, the supervisory practices linked to climate-related financial risks. Furthermore, the revisions to the Capital Requirements Directive currently under discussion by the EU co-legislators further reaffirm the ECB's mandate in this area by broadening the supervisory toolkit to address environmental, social and governance risks, and by explicitly requiring banks to have concrete plans to address C&E risks arising from misalignment with EU climate targets. Indeed, since 2020 the ECB has been starting to implement many of the principles that the Basel Committee has now established on a global scale. It has now been two years since we started taking concrete steps to include C&E risks in our ongoing supervision. In 2020 we published a guide on C&E risks, which outlined our expectations for the management and disclosure of these risks. In 2021 we published a report on banks' self-assessments of where they stood relative to those expectations and shared some of the good practices we had observed in the banking industry. Early in 2021 we also asked all banks under our supervision to devise concrete action plans for ensuring full alignment with our expectations. Banks provided us with such plans, and where we found them deficient, we asked them to be sharpened, which was subsequently done. In 2022 we continue to check progress under these action plans by assessing whether banks have advanced the plans submitted in 2021 and the extent to which they use them as an effective steering instrument to advance their C&E risk practices. Moreover, in 2021, for the first time, C&E risks were qualitatively integrated in the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP). This year, our joint supervisory teams will complement the SREP assessments with their observations from a climate risk stress test and a thematic review on how banks incorporate these risks into their day-to-day business. This will also be qualitatively integrated in the SREP scores, which may have an indirect impact on minimum capital requirements. We are also launching on-site inspections of banks' management of these risks and are rounding off a targeted review focusing on commercial real estate exposures. All initiatives - the stress test, the thematic review and the on-site inspections - aim to monitor banks' alignment with the expectations set out in the ECB's Guide on C&E risks. They are part of what I described at the start of the year as a move towards an immersive approach to the management of climate-related and environmental risks in the banking sector. We intend to fully integrate C&E risks in the regular supervisory dialogue and cycle and keep them there, treating them in the same way as any other material risks that banks face. The climate risk stress test, the results of which will be published in July, constitutes an unprecedented effort, also on the ECB's part, to more fully understand how exposed euro area banks are to C&E risks. It will also give us a clearer picture of how resilient they are against these risks, as we are assessing, among other things, banks' climate risk stress test frameworks, but also the sustainability of their income sources vis-a-vis the green transition. Let me emphasise that in this exercise we define resilience very broadly. We test the capabilities of banks to analyse, assess and respond to the consequences of climate-related and environmental stress in both a quantitative and qualitative fashion. What I call a narrow stress test - i.e. the typical number-crunching to assess the impact of physical and transition stress on capital and income - is only one part of the overall exercise. At this stage, the fact that banks provide proof of their climate stress testing capabilities is as important as the results of the test. The results from this stress test will complement the information from the thematic review, in which we will assess the evolution of the soundness, effectiveness and comprehensiveness of banks' C&E risk management practices, as well as their ability to steer their C&E risk strategies and risk profiles towards the targets they set forth in their action plans. I will now delve a little deeper into this exercise. A year has passed since banks completed their self-assessments and drew up their action plans. So, where do banks stand in terms of their alignment with the ECB's supervisory expectations on managing C&E risks? This is the question the ECB's thematic review on C&E risks seeks to answer. The thematic review is being carried out jointly by the ECB and the national competent authorities and assesses 107 significant banks and 79 less significant banks. Truly all of European banking supervision is pitching in - supervisors from the ECB and the national competent authorities are working together to ensure the consistency of the supervisory approach as well as the outcomes of the exercise. This broad scope and our close cooperation have been incredibly enriching, as they have enabled us to actively share our knowledge and experience and to learn from each other's practices on a daily basis. While the ultimate objective is for all banks to be fully aligned with our supervisory expectations, the thematic review is intended to be a learning exercise - not just for supervisors across Europe, but also for the banks. This is why we have made a point of sharing good practices we have observed - so that banks can draw inspiration and push forward. New supervisory tools are being developed as banks step up their modelling and management of C&E risks. There is now a common understanding that these risks are a fundamental part of a bank's risk map and a key focus of the ECB's supervision of banks' risk management. The thematic review is still ongoing, but I would like to share some of our preliminary findings with you today, also ahead of the upcoming supervisory dialogue with banks on this topic. As I said before, there is good and bad news, but also reason to be hopeful. The good news is that one year after my first speech on the state of C&E risk management in the euro area banking sector, most banks have started to adapt their practices to incorporate C&E risks into their daily business. In early 2021 banks deemed that 90% of their practices were only partially or not at all aligned with our supervisory expectations. One year on, we are seeing positive change. More and more banks report that they are taking actions to become more closely aligned with the ECB's expectations. Similarly to last year, banks have made the most progress with the C&E expertise of their management body and within governance structures. The bad news is that clear gaps remain in all areas of focus of the Guide, and individual banks are not making progress across the board. Moreover, we have observed several inconsistencies. For example, banks' strategies account significantly more for transition risks than for physical risks. And although an increasing number of banks have deemed themselves to be materially exposed to C&E risks in the short to medium term, there are banks that have still not performed a materiality assessment. In addition, we see that banks do not fully consider how the misalignment of their clients with the Paris Agreement affects their own risk exposures. Thankfully, there is also reason to be hopeful. For each ECB expectation, there is at least one bank - and often many - with good practices. The governance and risk management practices that some banks have started to adopt confirm that what the ECB is asking of banks can be done. As the supervisor, our focus is on the safety and soundness of banks. Above all, we want to promote the stability of individual institutions and preserve financial stability. But banks should also want to effectively manage C&E risks and position themselves to benefit from the green transition. After all, the financing needs of the real economy during the green transition are only going to increase. As intermediaries with comprehensive knowledge about their customers, banks are exceptionally well positioned to support their clients during the transition. The development and deployment of innovative tools for measuring and monitoring C&E risks is also gaining momentum - among supervisors and banks. For instance, in our supervisory dialogue with banks as part of the thematic review, we have started to discuss real client cases to understand how thorough banks are being in their assessment of their clients' sustainability trajectories. We are also piloting tools aimed at improving our insights into how well banks are identifying and responding to the transition risk of their corporate clients. Our joint supervisory teams will soon start another round of feedback sessions with banks. These will give banks a better idea of where they stand relative to their peers. I would like to take this opportunity to invite the banks to use these exchanges to share more good practices and to clarify any of their practices that we have so far overlooked. After these feedback sessions, banks will receive comprehensive letters setting out any identified shortcomings together with concrete follow-up actions. I have referred to the progress that banks are making, which is in itself encouraging. However, as a supervisor we will only be satisfied when all banks are fully aligned with all of our expectations. This will be our mindset when we draft our feedback letters later this year. Because for all the encouraging progress we are seeing, there is still a long way to go. And this is a journey that needs to be completed as swiftly as possible. After last year's supervisory exercises, virtually all banks developed action plans to advance their practices. We have since banks to speed up their efforts. In more than 80% of cases, banks intend to complete the actions set out in their plans before the end of 2023. However, there is still a group of banks whose plans lack sufficient detail across the board and do not define clear and ambitious timelines for their actions. Having assessed the banks' action plans and the progress made in their practices for two years now, I see it as reasonable that banks can be fully compliant with all our expectations by the end of 2024 at the latest. At the same time, we remain open to listen to arguments of banks that may render this not feasible in individual cases. The absence for some banks of a thorough and complete assessment of the C&E risks and their materiality cannot be a reason for lack of progress and should be remediated promptly. Let me conclude. The recent Basel Committee principles confirm the urgent need for banks and supervisors to incorporate the management of climate-related and environmental risks into their practices. The ECB started to roll out its supervisory agenda on C&E risks in 2020 and, two years later, banks are making tangible progress with their C&E agendas, too. Many banks are still lagging behind in at least one area, though. That is why the ECB is laying out sufficiently accommodative deadlines for banks to fully implement C&E risks into their daily practices. At the same time, however, many banks already comply with at least one of the areas of C&E risk management the ECB wishes to see developed. We must use this opportunity to learn from each other - an effort that the ECB is happy to support by continuing to share good practices in the industry. This, in my view, is reason to be hopeful.","['ecb', 'risks', 'risk', 'crises', 'climate']","['risks climate', 'risks banks', 'practices ecb', 'climate risk', 'climate risks']","['risk management ecb', 'risks practices ecb', 'banks climate risk', 'environmental risks banking', 'ecb supervisory agenda']","['eu climate targets', 'climate risks', 'climate crisis', 'environmental crises', 'european banking supervision']"
7666,r220623a_FOMC,united states,2022-06-23,The Outlook for Inflation and Monetary Policy,bowman,0,"Thank you to the Massachusetts Bankers Association for the opportunity to speak to you today. It is often good to get away from Washington to gain some perspective, and it's always worthwhile for me when I can get some perspective from bankers. I will touch on some of the banking issues I expect are on your minds, but one of the biggest issues for everyone right now is inflation, what the Fed is doing to get inflation under control, and the implications for your businesses, your customers, and your communities. Inflation is the highest we have seen in the United States in 40 years and so far it shows little sign of moderating. At the same time, the economy is growing at a moderate pace, and the labor market is extremely tight, as indicated by a variety of measures including reports of many employers unable to find workers despite significantly raising wages. That tightness is contributing to inflation, because labor is the largest input cost for producing goods and providing services. Inflation is a significant challenge for everyone, but it hits lower- and moderate-income people the hardest, since they spend a larger share of their incomes on necessities and often have less savings to fall back on. Inflation is also a burden for businesses that must somehow balance unpredictable costs while setting prices that aren't so high that they discourage customers from purchasing. Inflation that continues at these levels is a threat to sustained employment growth and to the overall health of the economy. The inflation data show that, after moderating slightly for a short time, price increases for motor vehicles have picked up again, energy prices rose sharply in May, and prices for food have risen more than 10 percent from a year ago. The inflationary effect from the invasion of Ukraine has proven to be lasting for both energy and food  commodity prices, with little prospect of the conflict or those price pressures abating very soon. More broadly, global supply chain issues continue, in part because of the effect of ongoing COVID-19 lockdown policies in China that have slowed production and shipping. One important factor that we often point to in driving today's spending decisions and inflation outlook are expectations of future inflation. Near-term expectations tend to rise as current inflation increases, but when inflation expectations over the longer-term-- the next 5 to 10 years--begin to rise, it may indicate that consumers and businesses have less confidence in the Fed's ability to address higher inflation and return it to the Federal above our 2 percent goal, it would make it more difficult to change people's perceptions about the duration of high inflation and potentially more difficult to get inflation under control. As we see surveys like the Michigan survey report higher longer-term inflation expectations, we need to pay close attention and continue to use our tools to address inflation before these indicators rise further or expectations of higher inflation become entrenched. As I mentioned earlier, one force driving inflation is the extremely tight labor market. The benefits from a tight labor market are easy to see--the U.S. economy continued to add jobs at a pace of 400,000 per month for the past three months, which is remarkable considering the low number of people looking for work. Today, most people who want to work can find a job, and wages and salaries have risen faster than they have in decades. Even with these gains, wages have not kept pace with inflation, which has  made it much more difficult for many workers to make ends meet in the face of soaring housing, energy, and food costs. Job creation signals strong labor market demand, particularly in the current environment, with a large number of available jobs and fewer job seekers. In addition, the tightness of the labor market is exacerbated by a labor force participation rate that remains far below the pre-pandemic benchmark, representing millions of workers sitting on the sidelines. Many of these are early retirees, some incentivized to retire during the pandemic, and those with family caregiving challenges including very high costs for childcare. While the strong job market has brought some of these workers back into the workforce, it seems that many are still waiting or may not return, meaning that labor shortages will likely persist in many sectors of the economy. I've laid out many of the challenges, so now let me talk about what the Federal Reserve is doing to get inflation under control. In the face of inflation that continues to be much too high and in light of the recent high readings, the FOMC raised the federal funds rate by 75 basis points at our most recent meeting last week. That increase followed two rate hikes totaling 75 basis points earlier this year, and we indicated that further increases will likely be appropriate in the months ahead. On June 1, the Fed took a separate step to tighten monetary policy by beginning to reduce its large balance sheet of securities holdings. I strongly supported the FOMC's decision last week, and I expect to support additional rate increases until we see significant progress toward bringing inflation down. Based on current inflation readings, I expect that an additional rate increase of 75 basis points will be appropriate at our next meeting as well as increases of at least 50 basis  points in the next few subsequent meetings, as long as the incoming data support them. Depending on how the economy evolves, further increases in the target range for the federal funds rate may be needed after that. The case for further rate hikes is made stronger by the current level of the ""real"" federal funds rate, which is the difference between the nominal rate and near-term inflation expectations. With inflation much higher than the federal funds rate, the real federal funds rate is negative, even after our rate increases this year. Since inflation is unacceptably high, it doesn't make sense to have the nominal federal funds rate below near-term inflation expectations. I am therefore committed to a policy that will bring the real federal funds rate back into positive territory. While I expect that the labor market will remain strong as the FOMC continues to tighten monetary policy, these actions do not come without risk. But in my view, our number one responsibility is to reduce inflation. Maintaining our commitment to restore price stability is the best course to support a sustainably strong labor market. The Fed's credibility, earned over decades of low inflation, is a powerful policy tool that is critical to our long-term success. If that credibility erodes, it must be re-earned. As a step toward that goal, I also supported the Committee's action to begin reducing the Fed's balance sheet, which is providing unneeded economic stimulus making inflation worse. The current balance sheet is composed of Treasury securities and a significant amount of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Since the longer- term goal of the balance sheet reduction plan includes a Treasuries-only balance sheet, it would make sense to eventually incorporate MBS sales into the plan so that reaching this  goal does not take too long. My longer-term goal would be to get the Fed out of the business of indirectly intervening in the real estate market. In closing, I know that inflation, and our efforts to lower it, may present challenges for banks. The first session on your agenda this morning discussed interest rate risk, and I would be interested to learn how you are managing this risk so far and what you expect as the year progresses. Many of your sessions and speakers overlap with the Fed's work in supervision and much of what I'm focused on, including innovation and how best to use technology like AI and fintech to level the playing field for banks. Attracting and retaining talent, along with succession planning, are absolutely critical for long-term sustainability. One other matter is the recently issued Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) proposed rule that would significantly change supervisory implementation and qualifying activities. I strongly encourage you to review this proposal and comment so that banks subject to the CRA understand the changes and will be able to continue to effectively serve their customers and communities. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on these issues, and I look forward to our discussion. Thanks again for the invitation to join you this week--it's great to be here with you to discuss these and other important matters.","['inflation', 'inflationary', 'massachusetts', 'monetary', 'economy']","['inflation continues', 'difficult inflation', 'increases inflation', 'economy inflation', 'inflation extremely']","['fed doing inflation', 'inflation difficult workers', 'inflation fed doing', 'inflation continues high', 'reduce inflation maintaining']","['current inflation increases', 'high inflation', 'inflation outlook', 'higher inflation', 'low inflation']"
6115,r220624a_BOE,united kingdom,2022-06-24,What did the monetarists ever do for us?,pill,0,"Bank of Japan's (BoJ's) Policy Board expressed an opinion that the Bank of Japan should ""implement a quantitative easing by targeting the monetary base"". In 2001, Japan began down that road, purchasing government bonds financed by the creation of central bank reserves. Outside Japan, QE was first adopted by the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England in 2008 and 2009, as they neared the lower bound for nominal interest rates and sought to provide additional monetary stimulus. In 2015, these countries were joined by the euro-area, as the European Central Bank (ECB) began expanding its balance sheet as it neared the lower bound for interest rates. Three of these four central banks were continuing to expand their balance sheets in the second half of These unconventional monetary policy interventions have steadily entered the public's consciousness. provides one metric - the number of news stories containing the words QE or Quantitative Easing. This picked up after the global financial crisis and remains at elevated levels currently. Having not registered in news stories prior to this century, QE now appears to have entered the popular lexicon. This paper reviews the impact of central bank balance sheet expansions on financial markets and the economy. These expansions are, in one sense, nothing new. As Section 2 explores, significant expansions of central bank balance sheets have been going on for as long as we have had central banks. In previous centuries, however, these monetary injections tended to be associated with the financing of wars or the bail-out of banking systems, rather than operating as a monetary policy tool. It is only during this century, and in particular since the global financial crisis, that we have seen central bank balance sheet expansions taking on an explicit monetary policy objective. Since 2007-8, as a number of countries approached the effective lower bound for official interest rates, central banks made outright purchases of securities funded by the creation of central bank reserves - Quantitative Easing or QE. This has led to a substantial increase in central banks' balance sheets, both relative to nominal GDP and to the stock of government debt outstanding ( relative to nominal GDP relative to government debt With the Bank of Japan, Bank of England and European Central Bank continuing to expand their balance sheets, these monetary interventions are continuing to rise. They are already large in quantitative terms, at between 30-80% of each country's GDP and 20-40% of the government debt stock outstanding. These central bank interventions, unprecedented in scale, are an important and topical area of study by central banks, academics and market practitioners alike. There have been a significant number of recent studies assessing the impact of QE. This paper provides a summary of these studies, while also offering some new empirical evidence on both the channels through which QE operates and its impact on financial markets and economic activity. Section 2 provides a short historical perspective on QE. Section 3 explores the channels through which QE might, in practice, operate. As with any policy intervention, the effectiveness of QE depends on the extent of distortions or frictions in the functioning of various markets. Because these frictions may change over time, depending on the state of the economy and financial system, so too will the effectiveness of QE. Section 4 begins to assess the effectiveness of QE, with a particular focus on its impact on financial markets. Looking across countries and episodes, there is reasonably clear evidence of QE announcements having lowered yields on long-term government debt. QE interventions have also tended to be associated with changes in other asset prices, such as equities, corporate bonds and exchange rates. These ""event studies"" of the impact of QE on asset markets provide one means of assessing the wider macro-economic impact of unconventional monetary interventions. Existing event studies of asset price movements suggest that QE is likely to have had a material impact, providing a significant, if temporary, boost to growth and inflation. But as these studies use a particular approach to identifying the impact of QE, they leave a number of issues open. By using a different approach to identifying the impact of QE, Sections 4 and 5 present some new empirical evidence on the macroeconomic impact of central bank balance sheet expansions, across time and countries. Our key findings include the following. First, it is only when central bank balance sheet expansions are used as a tool of monetary policy that they appear to have effects on the economy. QE is, in this sense, a different animal to other central bank balance sheet operations. Second, there is evidence (at least for the US) that the effect of QE may vary over time, depending on the state of the economy and financial system, as theory would suggest. Specifically, the impact of QE is greater the weaker the economy and the more disturbed the state of financial markets. This state-dependency in the impact of QE is potentially important to our understanding of how QE has worked in the past and the circumstances in which it is likely to be effective in the future. Third, QE appears to have strong spill-over effects to other advanced economies. Perhaps predictably, these spill-overs appear to operate largely through financial market channels. Indeed, these international spill-over effects of QE may, for some countries, be larger in their impact than equivalent-sized domestic monetary interventions. This finding is important when assessing the impact of overseas monetary interventions on domestic activity. These are not the only issues that are topical and contentious when assessing the impact of QE. For example, there is clearly the potential for QE to have important distributional consequences - for example, on households' and financial intermediaries' assets and portfolio allocation decisions. These distributional issues are important and have been studied previously, including by the Bank of England (for example, Bank of England (2012)). This paper focuses on the aggregate impact of QE on financial markets and the macro-economy. Central bank balance sheet expansions are, assuredly, not new. For example, the Bank of England's balance sheet was more than 10% of nominal GDP throughout most of the 18 and 19 centuries and into the first half of the 20 century ( ). That compares with a balance sheet of a little over 5% of GDP just prior to the global financial crisis. In the period since, the Bank's balance sheet has since expanded to reach around its highest level relative to GDP since its inception in 1694. Historical balance sheet expansions tended typically to be associated with the financing of wars and the management of financial crises. Although these interventions increased the stock of central bank money, they would not have been seen at the time as monetary policy, at least as it is currently conceived. Indeed, for much of the Bank of England's history, it played a dual role as both ""a national and a profit-making bank"" (Clapham (1958)). In that sense, its public policy role in setting monetary policy was at best vague and imperfect. Reflecting its role as financier of war and other government activities, historical expansions of the Bank of England's balance sheet have tended to be backed by government securities. In some cases, these expansions were specifically designed to facilitate an increase in government debt. For example, in the early 18 century, the Bank ended up owning nearly all of UK government debt ). This was in some ways a continuation of the Bank's original mandate in 1694, which was to raise funds to finance war with France (Clapham (1958)). Balance Sheet, scaled by nominal Nor were these historical central bank balance sheet expansions peculiar to the Bank of England. In their study of central bank balance sheets across sixteen countries since 1900, Ferguson, Schaab and Schularick (2015) find that historical expansions have also been mostly associated with geopolitical or financial crises. In particular, central bank balance sheets increased around the Second World War, at that stage approaching 40% of GDP in a range of countries ( Central bank balance sheet expansions during the course of this century have had a very different motivation. This has been to support economic activity, operating as a monetary policy measure augmenting the role of interest rates when they are close to their effective lower bound - hence QE as a monetary policy tool first emerged in Japan in 1999. Japanese Consumer Prices Index inflation, excluding energy, fell below zero in early 1999. In response, the Bank of Japan continued to cut its policy rate, but found it was approaching the lower bound for nominal interest rates. In the minutes of the February 1999 Bank of Japan policy meeting, one member of the committee noted that the Bank of Japan should implement ""a quantitative easing by targeting the monetary Yet it was not until March 2001 that such a ""quantitative easing"" policy was announced by the Bank of Japan. This involved using the quantity of central bank reserves as the operating policy target, injected via purchases of Japanese government bonds, with a commitment to maintaining the provision of liquidity until CPI inflation became zero or higher on a sustained basis (Ugahi (2007), Ueda (2011) and Ito (2014)). This program was expanded over the following five years, with the range of assets purchases extended to include equities and asset-backed securities. Central bank balance sheet expansions for monetary policy purposes became more common after the global financial crisis. Around the world, central banks loosened monetary policy to offset the collapse in demand, with short-term interest rates cut to close to zero in the US, UK and euro area. Each of these central banks, as well as the Bank of Japan, subsequently significantly expanded their balance sheets. Until the Bank of Japan's quantitative and qualitative easing (QQE) announced in April 2013, these expansions were of a similar scale relative to nominal GDP, at around 20% ( ). Relative to government debt, these balance sheet expansions were also similar ( Yet, in some respects, the differences in these balance sheet expansions have been as great as the and Neeley (2013)). Some of the expansions reflected special liquidity operations, designed to liquefy bank balance sheets. In other words, they were not monetary policy interventions, but classic lender of last resort operations. In part reflecting that, the assets backing these expansions have often differed materially along three dimensions: repurchase agreements (""repo"") versus outright purchases; public versus private sector assets; and longer versus shorter maturity assets. programmes at the start of the crisis. For the ECB, these repo operations remained its main source of balance sheet expansion until it started its asset purchase programme in 2015. In general, these large-scale repo operations were about providing liquidity support to the banking sector and, in the ECB's case, improving the functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. By contrast, when used as a tool of monetary policy, central bank balance sheet expansions have tended to take the form of outright asset purchases funded by the creation of central bank reserves. They have involved the creation of central bank reserves - an essentially zero credit risk, zero duration risk instrument - by buying outright from the private sector assets that have either a longer duration and/or higher credit risk than the corresponding liability. In the case of government debt purchases, the extent of this credit risk transfer is minimal since most government debt is perceived as low risk. But by purchasing long maturity government debt outright, QE operations can influence duration risk in the private sector. Moreover, many central banks have gone further along the credit risk spectrum by purchasing private sector assets - socalled ""credit easing"". In practice, a spectrum of options is possible ( ). During the crisis, most points on this spectrum have been covered by QE operations at one time or another. For example, the Bank of Japan's QE program in the early 2000s included a range of asset purchases. In their most recent quantitative and qualitative monetary easing (QQE) program, adopted in April 2013 and expanded in October 2014, the Bank of Japan has placed greater emphasis on longermaturity government bonds and riskier assets, such as commercial paper, corporate bonds, equity exchange traded funds and real estate derivatives (Arslanalp and Botman (2015)). In September 2016, the Bank of Japan added ""yield curve control"" to their QQE program, explicitly targeting the In the US, the importance of the Agency MBS market for mortgage rates, and the size of this market, made it a natural candidate for the Federal Reserve's asset purchases, alongside US government bonds (Gagnon et al (2010)). MBS purchases comprised around 45% of the Federal Reserve's asset purchases during its QE programme. In the euro area, the ECB's outright purchases have mainly comprised the bonds of 18 euro-area governments, purchased through a public sector purchase programme (PSPP) announced in January 2015 (Coeure (2015)). This programme also includes bonds issued by recognised agencies, regional and local governments, international organisations and multilateral development banks located in the euro area. The ECB has also purchased small quantities of covered bonds, asset backed securities and corporate bonds. In the UK, the Bank of England has predominantly bought UK government bonds (""gilts"") a part of its QE programme, as this is a large market and allows the purchases to be targeted at assets held by the non-bank sector (Fisher (2010)). Most recently the Bank of England has commenced a programme of corporate bond purchases (Bank of England (2016)), albeit on a relatively modest scale. Even for government bond purchases, there has been a lot of heterogeneity in the maturity of bonds purchased. That partly reflects differences in government bond markets. For example, the maturity of the Bank of England's stock of asset purchases has been broadly in line with the stock of outstanding government debt. In some cases, such as the Fed's Maturity Extension Programme, there has been a specific focus on trying to buy longer duration assets (Ehlers (2012) and Meaning and Zhu (2012)). The design of the ECB's QE programme, announced in January 2015, took explicit account of the different sovereign bond markets in the euro area (Coeure (2015)). Ben Bernanke famously remarked in 2014: ""The problem with QE is that it works in practice, but it doesn't work in theory."" In certain theoretical settings, Bernanke's observation is true. Even in models which admit some role for central bank balance sheet expansions, the channels through which QE works are still the subject of debate, academically and practically. In this section, we discuss these various channels and the factors which determine their quantitative significance. Schematically, the transmission mechanism for QE can be thought to comprise two legs: an expansion of the central bank's balance sheet, creating new reserves to purchase short-term bills; and a maturity extension programme, swapping these bills for longer-term bonds. In many standard macroeconomic models, neither leg has an effect on economic activity. Expanding the supply of reserves has no economic impact if the opportunity cost of holding reserves is small. reallocating assets between private and public-sector balance sheets has no impact if these assets are only valued for their payoffs and there are no constraints on investors' portfolio positions other than their budget constraints (Woodford (2012)). In order to understand how QE might work, we need to depart from these standard models by adding in various market frictions and distortions. Over the past few years, the ever-growing QE literature has identified a range of potential channels through which unconventional monetary policy might operate. These are shown schematically in . monetary policy signalling - QE conveys extra information about the future path of short-term interest rates; portfolio rebalanci ng - QE induces a switch into longer duration or higher risk assets; liquidity effects - QE squeezes the liquidity premium on various assets; exchange rate - QE lowers the price of domestic asset relative to overseas assets; - QE reduces the amount of volatility in markets or uncertainty about the outlook; and bank lending - QE helps stimulate a rise in lending by banks . Some of these are standard channels of monetary policy transmission, recast for the unconventional era. For example, the monetary policy signalling and exchange rate channels also operate when using conventional interest rate instruments. But some channels are more distinctively associated with QE. For example, the portfolio balance and liquidity channels are specific, if not unique, to QE. To be effective, all of these channels rely, to greater or lesser extent, on the existence of various frictions or imperfections in the functioning of financial markets. Without these frictions, the effects on asset prices of asset purchases would be expected to be small or non-existent. provides a taxonomy of these market frictions and identifies the key papers to date which have explored these channels of QE transmission. Generally speaking, these frictions can be grouped two ways: Information frictions: These might arise from private agents having less than perfect information either about the future monetary policy reaction function of the authorities and/or about the future course of the macro-economy (Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) and Rudebusch and Williams (2008)). This friction underlines the signalling, exchange rate and uncertainty channels of QE. Market frictions: These might arise from imperfect degrees of substitutability between different classes of asset, from investors having a preferred habitat for bonds of a particular duration or credit risks, or from limits to arbitrage between certain assets (Vayonas and Vila (2009)). This friction underlies the portfolio balance, liquidity and bank lending channels of The importance and effectiveness of these different channels will depend jointly on the type of assets bought, the design of the asset purchase programme, and the structure of the economy and financial system. Conventional monetary policy relies for its effectiveness on a particular market friction - inertia in labour and goods prices. This price or wage stickiness gives conventional monetary policy its potency. Because this friction is structural and slow-moving, the effectiveness of conventional monetary policy is itself expected to be reasonably inertial and state-invariant. Unconventional monetary policy relies for its effectiveness on a different set of frictions - portfolio allocation decisions by financial intermediaries. Because these frictions in financial markets are likely to be faster-moving and more transient, the effectiveness of unconventional monetary policy would itself be expected to vary over time and across states of nature. For example, QE may have a bigger effect when the financial system is impaired (Miles and Schanz (2014)). Below, we consider the empirical evidence on the potential state-dependency of QE. The first stage of the transmission mechanism from asset purchases to the real economy occurs through their impact on financial market prices. A number of empirical studies have looked quantitatively at the impact of QE on a range of asset prices: government bond yields; exchange rates; equity prices; volatility; and corporate bond spreads. Borio and Zabai (2016) summarise various previous empirical studies in Table 4 of their paper. Because financial markets are forward looking, the main impact of asset purchases on government bond yields is likely to occur when expectations of purchases are formed rather than when purchases are made. A number of papers assess the impact of asset purchases by applying an ""event study"" approach, looking at the immediate reaction of government bond yields to announcements about QE. Gagnon et al (2011) and Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2011) analyse the market reaction to Williams (2014) summarises the evidence, noting that $600bn of LSAP purchases have tended, on average, to lower the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds by 15-25 basis points. This is roughly the same-sized move in longer-term yields as would be expected from a 0.75-1 percentage point cut in the Federal Funds rate. Joyce et al (2011) estimate that the Bank of England's first wave of asset purchases from March 2009 to January 2010, which involved purchasing a cumulative PS200 billion of medium- to long-term UK government bonds, led to an average fall in 5 to 25-year gilt yields of about 100 basis points.

Bank lending is not constrained. Agents cannot perfectly substitute other forms of lending. Bowman et al (2015) reduced yields by around 25bps. As discussed below, the Bank's monetary policy package announced in August 2016 also had a significant impact on longer-term government bond yields. The ECB's asset purchase programme was announced in January 2015. Looking at news events around ECB QE, Altavilla, Carboni and Molto (2015) find that euro-area sovereign 10-year bond yields fell by 30 to 50 basis points. Middeldorp (2015) uses the relative frequency of Bloomberg news articles containing ""QE"" or ""Quantitative Easing"" and finds a significant effect across a variety of asset classes, not only in the euro-area but in the US and UK too. Andrade et al (2016) also find that the ECB's asset purchase programme had a significant and persistent impact on long-term yields. Finally, for the Bank of Japan's asset purchases, Ito (2014) finds that QE lowered long-term interest rates and flattened the yield curve, significantly and persistently. Consistent with those studies, shows the impact of QE announcements by the Bank of Central Bank and the Bank of Japan on long-term interest rates. It also shows a line of best fit. While individual country experiences have clearly differed, and the pattern is by no means uniform, in general QE interventions have tended to be associated with a fall in long-term government bond yields, as we would expect. shows the impact of these same interventions on short-term interest rates. These would be expected to capture any monetary policy signalling impact, to the extent QE is interpreted as offering a signal about a lower-than-previously-expected path for future short-term interest rates. Consistent with the signalling hypothesis, short-term interest rates fell in the majority of cases, although the degree of cross-country variation in responses is again considerable. Figure 8: Change in long rates around selected QE announcements announcements Looking at , it is clear that there is considerable variation across time and across countries in the impact of QE on the yield curve. In the UK, the largest fall in gilt yields was in response to the March 2009 announcement that the Bank of England would begin a programme of asset purchases. As shown in the reaction to subsequent QE announcements has been more muted. 2010. In October 2011, growing concerns about the competitiveness and macroeconomic imbalances of some euro-area economies led to the MPC resuming its asset purchases. Between in Joyce et al (2012), the absolute size of the impact on gilt yields was smaller in this case. In July again with little reaction from gilt yields. One explanation for this more muted effect is that the market had begun to anticipate the use of QE. For the October 2011 and July 2012 announcements, a resumption of asset purchases may have been expected because of earlier MPC communications, including the minutes of the September MPC meeting and the flow of adverse economic news. According to a Reuters survey of economists, the October 2011 announcement contained significant news about expected asset purchases. surprise and average 5-25 gilt yield reaction surprise and average 5-25 reaction in spread of gilts to US treasuries Another possible factor may have been the significant stream of other, in particular international, economic news during this period that may have affected gilt yields within our event window. If so, then looking at the reaction of gilt yields relative to German and US government bond yields may provide a better indication of the impact of QE on gilt yields. replicates using the spread between 10-year gilt yields and 10-year US government bond yields and suggests more of an effect. yields Estimated 10-year term premia While event studies can be used to estimate the initial impact of QE on gilt yields, they are less wellsuited to capture persistent effects. In theory, we would expect the impact of QE to be temporary - for example, because of temporary flow effects on liquidity premia. One practical reason to doubt that UK QE had a large persistent impact on gilt yields is the very close correlation between yields ) and estimates of term premia ( ) in the UK and US in recent years. One interpretation of this high correlation is that international factors may be more important determinants of gilt term premia than domestic factors, including QE (Kaminska, Meldrum and an interesting case study in this respect. Section 5 assesses the evidence on international spill-overs from QE. Insofar as investors regard other assets - such as corporate bonds and equities - as closer substitutes for government bonds than money, we might expect them to re-balance their portfolio towards these assets if their money holdings are boosted by temporary bond purchases (Benford et al (2009)). This would tend to put upward pressure on the prices of those assets and downward pressure on the exchange rate. Changes in government bond yields may also affect the rate at which investors discount future cash flows on these assets, also boosting their price. Announcements about QE may contain information about the future course of monetary policy or the economy, with implications for future corporate earnings and the uncertainty around them. This effect could either push up or depress the prices of these assets depending on how QE affects agents' risk perceptions. This means that, although we would expect QE eventually to push up riskier asset prices, their short-term impact may in some cases be ambiguous. announcements around selected QE announcements As shown in , there is evidence of some asset purchase programmes having dampened measures of uncertainty, proxied here by the VIX index of US equity implied volatility (Bollerslev, Tauchen and Zhou (2009)). This pattern is far from uniform, however. Moreover, there is some evidence of the announcement of large QE programmes having generated a rise in financial market uncertainty, at least in the short term, perhaps because these interventions coincided with periods of significant financial market stress. As for the exchange rate, shows that most of QE announcements led to a depreciation. This is consistent with QE loosening financial conditions in the domestic economy, with larger loosenings imparting greater downward pressure on the exchange rate. Section 5 considers the impact of QE on the exchange rate in the context of international spill-overs. shows the impact on corporate bond yields of QE interventions. In the UK, there were substantial falls in corporate bond yields following QE announcements. Sterling investment-grade corporate bond yields fell by a similar amount to gilt yields, leaving spreads to gilts unchanged. Sterling high-yield corporate bond yields fell more sharply, on average by 150 basis points over the six QE announcements, with spreads narrowing by 70 basis points. The narrowing in spreads is consistent with QE reducing both longer-term safe rates of interest and the default risk for firms. QE announcements are, in general, associated with higher equity prices ( ). The reaction is, however, far from uniform across different QE interventions. For example, in the UK the FTSE index rose following the May, August and November 2009 QE announcements, but fell after the February and March 2009 events. Summing across all events, the FTSE index on average fell by 3%. It is possible any significant positive impact on equity prices may have taken longer to feed through. around selected QE announcements QE announcements Overall, these event studies suggest evidence of a reaction in asset prices, other than government securities, to QE announcements. These effects are, on average, smaller and more volatile than for government bond yields, however. It is possible the event window used in these studies is too short to capture these asset price channels fully, with portfolio rebalancing taking time to have its full effect. To assess the impact of QE over a longer period, the third column in reports the change in asset prices over the full period during which UK QE1 purchases were being made, from 4 March 2009 (the day before the programme was announced) to 22 January 2010 (the day of the last QE1 auction). Over this period, asset prices movements were much more pronounced. Sterling corporate bond spreads narrowed dramatically, for both investment and non-investment grade bonds. And there was a sustained rise in the FTSE index of around 50%. It would be heroic to attribute all of these gains to QE, but it seems plausible it made some contribution. Some further insight into the portfolio re-balancing process can be found by looking directly at the portfolio allocation decisions of financial intermediaries. In the UK, policymakers explicitly structured their QE purchases with the aim of buying primarily from the domestic non-bank financial sector, such as life insurance companies and pension funds (ICPFs). They are traditionally the largest holders of long-term gilts (Bank of England (2009)). Joyce, Liu and Tonks (2014) look at the impact of QE on the behaviour of insurance companies and pension funds, using sectoral and micro-level data. Using counterfactual analysis of what would have happened to investors' asset allocations in the absence of QE, they report ex-ante and ex-post measures of the impact of QE on insurance companies' and pension funds' investment behaviour They find that there was some portfolio rebalancing behaviour by institutional investors as they reduced their allocations to gilts and increased their allocations to corporate bonds. By contrast, institutional investors moved out of equities during the period of QE purchases. Figure 18: Impact of QE on UK insurance companies and pension funds, ex-ante and ex-post QE effects, PS million If QE successfully raised equity and corporate bond prices, we might expect firms to respond by making more use of capital markets to raise funds. In other words, there would be a positive effect of QE on the quantity of debt and equity raised, as well as its price. The evidence is consistent with such an effect. Net equity issuance by UK private non-financial corporations was particularly strong in 2009, reversing the negative annual average net issuance observed over 2003-08. And gross corporate bond issuance by UK private non-financial corporations in 2009 was also stronger than ","['banking', 'banks', 'bank', 'qe', 'monetary']","['quantitative easing', 'monetary easing', 'qe monetary', 'credit easing', 'japan bank']","['qe quantitative easing', 'bank japan qe', 'quantitative easing qe', 'monetary easing qqe', 'reserves quantitative easing']","['quantitative easing', 'historical central bank balance sheet expansions', 'central bank balance sheet expansions', 'qualitative monetary easing', 'credit easing']"
6116,r220628a_BOE,united kingdom,2022-06-28,Navigating market signals: MaPS for policy makers,rosen,0,"Andrea Rosen talks about our market intelligence and analysis function. It helps us to understand and interpret what's happening in global financial markets. She describes how it supports the work of our Monetary Policy Committee. And she looks at the tools it uses. They include: Good morning and many thanks to AFME for having me here today. Before joining the Bank of England as Head of Market Intelligence and Analysis, I spent my entire career at an investment bank. As many of you can relate, my job involved a tremendous amount of time focused on what central banks said and did, and what that meant for markets. I often wondered how much policymakers understood market dynamics and how that fed into their decisions and communications. Now that I am on the other side, I get those questions all of the time. By design, much of what happens inside a central bank is not public. But, given the importance of markets to central banks and vice versa, I think there is value in financial market participants better understanding how market intelligence is gathered; how it is analysed; and - crucially - how it is used by policymakers at the Bank of England. The sheer breadth of what our Market Intelligence and Analysis function covers - servicing the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), the Financial Policy Committee (FPC) and the Bank's Governors, spanning the market conjuncture but also policy design, horizon scanning and structural issues - means that I could be here all day . Instead, I'm going to focus my remarks on the work that we do to inform the MPC on financial markets, through a mix of discussions with market participants, data analytics and the new . Monetary policy decisions are complex and depend on a large number of factors. Financial markets are also complex, and constantly evolving. It is certainly not the job of policymakers to just mechanically do what markets expect or want them to. But the MPC does invest heavily in trying to understand global markets, the signals they are sending us about the outlook, and the impact of asset prices and financial conditions for the real economy . This is not always straightforward: as you know, understanding markets does not stop at tracking price movements. It involves keeping up with the global market narrative, challenging what we hear with data, attempting to strip signals from the noise, taking liquidity and functioning into account, identifying potential biases and putting UK moves in a global, cross-asset context. It is also a highly iterative process. It is important for the MPC to recognise market signals and expectations, without being governed by them. There are many reasons for this, but let me list a few: Market channels are arguably more important in the UK, where the financial sector is unusually large and diverse relative to the size of the overall economy. Our status as a small open economy means that we don't operate in a vacuum , making it crucial to understand UK developments in an international framework. There are many examples of why, not least the global co-movement of risk free rates; the fact that equity risk premia are also correlated across countries; and the impact on sterling when global risk aversion leads to dollar strength. Ultimately the MPC sets policy to meet its objective having synthesised a vast array of inputs. Sometimes that view will coincide with central expectations in the market, other times it may involve a policy ""surprise"". But either way, market intelligence and analysis are key inputs to the information set that the Committee consider. The work we do to inform the MPC combines market data and our models with a rich set of qualitative inputs - based on extensive discussions with market participants and our own presence in markets, through sterling operations and foreign exchange reserve management . Taken together, we call this Our robust approach to marrying feedback with data has been further supplemented by a new tool called the , which aims to provide even more systematic, repeatable and representative aggregate feedback from a broad range of financial market participants on a subset of questions relevant to the MPC. Let's take the MI, data analytics and MaPS in turn. Direct interactions with - and feedback from - market participants allow us to put important context and nuance around market moves and data. Needless to say, we can't and don't take what we hear at face value. We speak with a wide range of contacts for a given issue, and systematically aggregate the feedback, distil the conclusions and challenge them against our own judgement, as well as a comprehensive set of data and models. We have dedicated MI teams for specific markets and sectors, as well as a cross-asset overlay . We supplement the views from our external contact base with that of specialist experts within our own staff - both our traders , as well as a number of subject matter specialists across the Bank. By frequently sharing and testing all of that information, a broader risk picture emerges. We have an agile approach: primarily focusing on rates and FX markets, including a dedicated team for UK rate expectations, but with a global focus and built-in flexibility. For example, work on commodity markets has featured more prominently in recent MPC deliberations, as has our attempt to track how global growth expectations are feeding into equity and credit market conditions. Our structure also enables us to look into emerging trends, such as the ways in which digital currencies may interact with the broader financial system, and the role of algorithmic trading in market functioning. Whilst we form our own judgments on what's important, we are always interested to hear what topics are at the forefront of the mind of our contacts. But who are these contacts? We interact with a wide array of market participants, spanning the buy- and sell-side, as well as industry bodies and providers of market infrastructure . Our Meeting Varied People initiative, launched by Governor Andrew Bailey in 2021, is aimed at seeking even greater diversity in both the institutions and individuals we engage with . This diversity of thought ensures that we get the best information possible to fulfil our mission. Our interactions are governed by the , which ensures rigour and transparency in terms of who we speak with and what we do with the information we receive. An important part of our ability to challenge or support what we hear from market participants comes from examining market data, and testing views against our internal models. Data helps us attempt to complete the picture when answering familiar questions like: how much is central expectation vs. balance of risks; are international metrics co-moving unusually; how can you decompose drivers in a given market; does the joint movement across asset classes corroborate one narrative vs another, etc. There is much to learn by identifying the underlying drivers of movements and placing them in a cross-market, cross-asset context. For example, looking at bond/equity correlations tells us a richer story than just examining each market in isolation. And analysing the relationship between sterling, gilts and inflation metrics adds to our understanding of market views on the UK economy. Another important use of market data analytics is to provide a quantitative framework to complement MI for monitoring market functioning. Liquidity, volatility and trading conditions often feature in our discussions with market participants, as they should, given the importance of market functioning to the transmission of monetary policy and as an indicator of financial stability. We take these discussions very seriously, but it is our ability to test what we hear with data that makes this insight even more powerful. Amongst our tools, we can track UK market positioning and depth through trade-level and aggregate data. The Bank also has a number of dashboards that draw together a variety of relevant indicators across UK gilts, derivatives, FX and money markets. These dashboards give us a useful snapshot of, for example, whether UK metrics have moved sharply in a historical context; whether these moves are large relative to other markets; how each market is functioning; and what level of ""noise"" are we seeing in the data We have a process in place to overlay what we see in the dashboards with what we hear and judge from markets, and to flag any issues with implications for market functioning directly to Governors. Given the volatility of the past couple of years, we engage with Governors frequently on this matter. Despite the huge value of the MI plus data approach, we perceived the need to add a layer of systematic and repeatable feedback from market active participants in the form of a regular survey. This would enable the MPC to quantify and probe market expectations for monetary policy beyond what pricing is already tells us, and would allow for cross-meeting comparisons to identify trends. , with the results published on our website 24 hours after every MPC decision . ( Survey respondents comprise a broad set of buy- and sell-side market participants and have been selected by the Bank based on a number of criteria, including: (i) relevant market activity in UK rates, FX or money markets, (ii) external market committee membership , (iii) expertise in UK markets and/or UK monetary policy, and (iv) willingness to participate regularly in the survey and in the Bank's market intelligence activity . Currently, we have around 40 respondents per round. The participants list will continue to evolve to reflect the composition of the markets we track, and we are open to considering additional respondents. MaPS questions are formulated by Bank staff, involve topics that are widely discussed in the public domain and never presume any specific policy action. Some of the questions remain constant over time (for example others are drafted by staff to target the prevailing context. MaPS participants also have the opportunity to provide free-form comments as feedback, and follow up on answers during our regular market intelligence engagements. Of course, MaPS results are one of many pieces of information that the MPC takes into account when formulating policy. But comparing MaPS against our MI and data brings an additional dimension for the MPC to consider. This has been particularly useful in analysing market pricing. If you think about what a market curve tells you, it is basically a combination of central (or modal) expectations for UK rates, plus assessments about the balance of risks, global spill overs, and technical factors such as liquidity and trading conditions. Obviously, what is priced is the most relevant measure for MPC and the metric of the transmission mechanism. But it is also useful to have a sense of how much of that is central expectations for Bank Rate, and how much can be attributed to other factors. Options markets give us some information, although layered with caveats given persistent liquidity challenges.The last few MaPS surveys have shown a premium in the market-implied profile of SONIA swaps and futures at the time the survey is taken, versus the curve derived by plotting what MaPS respondents say they expect from UK rates. In short, the MaPS curve has consistently appeared below the markets curve (Chart 5). To a significant degree, our market contacts have attributed this gap - through MaPS and MI - to the fact that, in their view, the risks remained skewed towards a higher path of Bank Rate , whether driven by domestic fundamentals, global spill overs and/or trading conditions . We have seen some of this play out in recent days, as curves continue to adjust based on global inflation and central bank expectations. MaPS has added to our collective understanding of what may be driving the UK curve, quantifying the perceived impact of the balance of risks and allowing us to track its evolution over time. Another area where MaPS and MI can be helpful tools is on market expectations about the future path of the Bank of England balance sheet. One can directly infer market expectations for the UK rates outlook by looking at the traded price of a range of instruments. But inferring the outlook for the Bank's balance sheet is more difficult to measure from market prices alone, particularly at the point where a balance sheet policy is still being considered and there are a number of global dynamics at play. Long rates are affected by a number of factors that are all endogenous to one another, and you could only extract an estimate of one if you control for the others. There is also a wide range of views of the impact of balance sheet policies on yields curves, so disentangling expectations is very difficult outside of narrow event windows. MaPS and MI can help. For example, MaPS asks about respondents' expectations for the stock of asset purchases ( ), as well as their perceptions of the possible impact of balance sheet unwind on yield curve pricing. Tracking the evolution of these responses has given the MPC valuable information. In parallel, our market intelligence function has been seeking views from a wide range of stakeholders on the operational considerations related to any future gilt sales, ahead of the Committee's update in August and decisions at any subsequent meetings. We expect views to continue evolving as more information is known, and will feed that accordingly to the MPC. In short, the systematic set of measures on core concepts that MaPS provides acts as a powerful cross-check to our qualitative feedback and data analysis functions. The combination of all three ensures that the MPC is well informed not just on what markets are pricing, but also on what they are telling us and why it matters. So how do we pull all these strands together? Our Market Intelligence and Analysis function is completely integrated into the 6-weekly MPC rounds ( ) and we are in regular contact with the Committee in between. Staff from our Markets teams provide daily and sometimes intra-day updates on market conditions to Governors and MPC members. We engage with policy makers frequently through both formal and informal discussions about market conditions, and provide a series of written and verbal briefings to the Committee in the lead up to each MPC round. Through MI, MaPS and data analytics, our briefings build on top of the basic data and give a sense of the evolving market narratives, the global, cross-asset picture, the decomposition of moves through our economic models, and how all of that feeds into expectations for a specific policy decision. Our work continues throughout the round, and the collective views of market participants are often referenced in the Minutes, the Monetary Policy Report and related communications. Our insight into market conditions also directly informs policy design, operational strategy and implementation. I have laid out how - although markets are important to the MPC through a number of different channels - market expectations are an input, rather than a driver in the policymaking process. Markets can be noisy, and Committee members are invested in attempting to understand and navigate them as best as possible. I hope that I have added to your understanding of the work that goes into making that happen. Having spent the majority of my career in the City, I have been struck by the level of sophistication, experience and depth of market knowledge that exists within Threadneedle Street. I have seen first-hand how much focus and attention the Bank directs towards markets; how extensive its market analysis, intelligence and operations are; and how important the market transmission mechanism is to the Bank's mission. As markets evolve, so do our market analysis and intelligence activities. We continue to invest in our data analytics and technology, to enhance and improve MaPS, and to remain agile in our thematic focus. Importantly, we wish to continue expanding our network of market contacts, so that they are even more diverse and reflective of the market setup. We value thoughtful, open, and candid input from market participants such as you. By necessity, some of our discussions tend to be one-way. But we must also be open where we can. The more our contacts understand what we do, the better they can help us to promote the good of the people of the United Kingdom by maintaining monetary and financial stability. I am very grateful to Ben Bowry and Helena Patterson for their assistance in preparing these remarks.

3223,r220628a_ECB,euro area,2022-06-28,Price stability and policy transmission in the euro area,lagarde,1,"Inflation in the euro area is undesirably high and it is projected to stay that way for some time to come. This is a great challenge for our monetary policy. In response to the changing inflation outlook, we have consistently followed the path of policy normalisation since December last year, sequentially adjusting our policy stance. Net asset purchases under our various programmes will come to an end this week. In July we intend to raise our policy rates for the first time in 11 years. And we have provided some guidance for our September policy meeting and the rate path we envisage taking thereafter. We will continue along this normalisation path - and we will go as far as necessary to ensure that inflation stabilises at our 2% target over the medium term. As Victor Hugo is said to have remarked, perseverance is the ""secret of all triumphs"". At the same time, the euro area differs from some other major economies for two key reasons and the path of normalisation has to be managed accordingly. First, inflation in the euro area today is being driven by a complex mix of factors that reflect, in part, our economic structures and strategic dependencies. This creates uncertainty about how quickly inflation will return to our medium-term target. In this setting, we need to act in a determined and sustained manner, incorporating our principles of gradualism and optionality. This means moving gradually if there is uncertainty about the outlook, but with the option to act decisively on any deterioration in medium-term inflation, especially if there are signs of a de-anchoring of inflation expectations. Second, the euro area has a unique institutional set-up, built around 19 not yet fully integrated national financial markets and 19 national fiscal policies, with limited coordination. This presents the risk of our monetary policy stance being unevenly transmitted across the union. And this is why we have emphasised all along that flexibility is integral to the process of normalising our monetary policy. It is essential to allow us to deliver the necessary policy stance and protect price stability in an environment where inflation is too high. Today, I would like to outline how a combination of shocks is currently hitting the euro area economy; how our monetary policy stance should react to the challenges these shocks create; and how we can preserve the transmission of this stance throughout the euro area. Broadly speaking, inflation in the euro area is being driven by two different types of shock. First, the original source of inflation is an extraordinary series of external shocks. Global supply chain disruptions coupled with surging global demand have pushed up prices sharply for industrial goods along the pricing chain. Mismatches between supply and demand in global energy markets have led to rising energy prices for the euro area. And the Russia-Ukraine war has amplified both of these factors while also driving up global food prices. Given its energy dependence, the euro area is experiencing these shocks acutely. The current levels of food and industrial goods inflation have not been seen since the mid-1980s. And the increase in the relative price of energy in recent months is much higher than the individual spikes that occurred in the 1970s. Together, energy, food and industrial goods account for around 80% of the overall inflation rate seen since the start of this year. The second factor driving up inflation - and one which has intensified in recent months - is the recovery in internal demand as the economy has reopened after the pandemic. Spending is rotating from goods back to services as restrictions are being lifted, while pent-up demand for tourism and leisure activities is proving unexpectedly strong. This rebound in spending has seen services inflation rise to 3.5% in May - the highest rate since the mid-1990s - with the highest price increases in contact-intensive sectors. These shocks, in particular the surge in energy prices, are driving up short-term inflation to very high levels. They are also leading to significant upward revisions to our medium-term inflation forecasts. The June Eurosystem staff projections saw inflation above 2% for the whole projection horizon, converging back to slightly above our medium-term target in 2024. But the size and complexity of these shocks are also creating uncertainty about how persistent this inflation is likely to be. We are not facing a straightforward situation of generalised excess demand or economic overheating, in which case the trajectory of medium-term inflation would have been clearer. Despite the bounceback in services, private consumption in the euro area is still more than 2% below its pre-pandemic level. And investment remains subdued. Although there have been some signs of above-target revisions in recent months, longer-term inflation expectations currently stand at around 2% across a range of measures. This supports our baseline projection for inflation to converge back towards our medium-term inflation target. At the same time, inflation pressures are intensifying and broadening through the domestic economy. Almost four-fifths of items in the consumption basket had annual price increases above 2% in April, and this is not only a reflection of high import prices. A new ECB indicator of domestic inflation - which removes items with a high import content - currently stands above 3%. In this environment, it is important to understand how persistent domestic price pressures are likely to become. There are several factors worth considering here. First, inflation is starting to take root in the services sector, which is the ""stickiest"" component of inflation and has a higher weight than goods. Second, unemployment in the euro area is at a record low , labour shortages are broad-based across sectors and indicators of labour demand remain strong. This tightening of the labour market, together with the catch-up effect triggered by the high inflation environment, suggests that wage growth will pick up. Our latest forecasts see wage growth above 4% in 2022 and 2023 and at 3.7% in 2024 - almost double the historical average before the pandemic. Third, these factors combined have led us to project core inflation at 2.3% in 2024 - and, in the euro area, core inflation tends to be an indicator of headline inflation over the medium term. We are also seeing signs that the supply shocks hitting the economy could linger for longer. While it is reasonable to assume that global supply chain disruptions will gradually be resolved, the outlook for energy and commodities remains clouded. There is not yet an end in sight to the Russia-Ukraine war, and we still face the risk of cuts to supply that could keep energy prices high. That could contribute to inflation directly - if it leads to further rises in energy costs - or indirectly, if a higher level of energy prices makes some production uneconomic and leads to a durable loss of economic capacity. The war is also likely to accelerate Europe's green transition as a way to enhance our energy security. In the long term, this should lead to lower energy costs in Europe. But in the meantime, it could lead to price increases for rare minerals and metals, higher costs for the investment needed in clean technologies, and an expansion of carbon-pricing schemes. That said, these shocks also have implications for growth and, as such, they can weigh on the medium-term inflation outlook. So what are we seeing in this regard? The external supply shocks hitting the euro area are affecting spending. Rising import prices represent a terms of trade ""tax"" which reduces the total income of the economy. Households are seeing their real income being squeezed. Real wage growth has been negative for two consecutive quarters. And consumer surveys suggest that households are expecting their real income and consumption to decline further over the next year. Firms are trying to protect their margins by raising prices, but this uncertain environment is also leading them to delay investment decisions. And sales growth now appears to be decelerating. The latest Purchasing Managers' Indices point to no further growth in new business, and business expectations in a year's time have reached their lowest level since October 2020. At the same time, spending is being supported by the boost to demand from the full reopening of the services sector. And consumption is being buffered by the large stock of household savings built up during the pandemic, fiscal support measures and the continued strength of the labour market, which is helping to sustain labour income overall. But if supply shocks drag on and inflation continues to exceed wage growth by a wide margin, losses in real income could intensify and the excess savings buffer could be eroded. The resulting hit to demand could test the resilience of the labour market and possibly temper the expected rise in labour income. In this setting, we have markedly revised down our forecasts for growth in the next two years. But we are still expecting positive growth rates due to the domestic buffers against the loss of growth momentum. Based on the overall outlook, the process of normalising our monetary policy will continue in a determined and sustained manner. But given the uncertainty we still face, the pace of interest rate normalisation cannot be defined ex ante. As I laid out in a recent blog post , the appropriate monetary policy stance has to incorporate our principles of gradualism and optionality. Gradualism allows policymakers to assess the impact of their moves on the inflation outlook as they go, which can be a prudent strategy in times of uncertainty. Optionality ensures that policy can react nimbly to the incoming data on the economy and inflation expectations and, if uncertainty decreases, re-optimise the policy path as necessary. Indeed, there are clearly conditions in which gradualism would not be appropriate. If, for example, we were to see higher inflation threatening to de-anchor inflation expectations, or signs of a more permanent loss of economic potential that limits resource availability, we would need to withdraw accommodation more promptly to stamp out the risk of a self-fulfilling spiral. These two elements of the monetary policy stance underlie the Governing Council's decisions at our meeting on 9 June. Consistent with moving gradually, we announced that we will end net asset purchases under our asset purchase programme on 1 July and intend to raise our three key interest rates by 25 basis points at our next meeting on 21 July. But we also announced that we expect to raise the key interest rates again in September, and ""if the medium-term inflation outlook persists or deteriorates, a larger increment will be appropriate at the September meeting."" This reflects the optionality principle. If the inflation outlook does not improve, we will have sufficient information to move faster. This commitment is, however, data dependent. This conditional approach to the pace of interest rate adjustment should not be confused with delaying normalisation. As our policy stance rests on a clear reaction function, interest-rate expectations and risk-free rates can adjust in advance. Our policy adjustment is already working its way through the euro area economy. The EURSTR forward rate ten years out is around 240 basis points above its pre-pandemic level, without policy rates having yet moved. One-year forward real rates, one-year ahead and five-year forward real rates, five-years ahead are around 100 and 140 basis points higher, respectively. Beyond September, the Governing Council has agreed that a ""gradual but sustained"" path of further rate increases will be appropriate. The starting point at each meeting will be an assessment of the evolution of the shocks, their implications for the outlook and the degree of confidence we have in inflation converging to our medium-term target. For these changes in our monetary policy stance to be effective, we need to preserve the orderly transmission of our stance throughout the euro area. The ECB is conducting monetary policy in an incomplete monetary union, in which its policy has to be transmitted through 19 different financial and sovereign bond markets. The yields on those sovereign bonds provide the benchmark for pricing all other private sector assets in the 19 Member States - and ultimately also for ensuring that our monetary policy impulse reaches individual firms and households. If spreads in some countries respond in a rapid and disorderly way to an underlying change in risk-free rates, over and above what would be justified by economic fundamentals, our capacity to deliver a single monetary policy is impeded. In this situation, a change in the policy stance can be followed by an asymmetric response of financing conditions, regardless of the credit risk of individual borrowers. In such conditions - when we have what we describe as unwarranted fragmentation - preserving policy transmission is a precondition for returning inflation to our target. The normalisation of our monetary policy will naturally lead to rising risk-free rates and sovereign yields. And, as euro area sovereigns are starting from different fiscal positions, it can also lead to a rise in spreads. But in order to preserve the orderly transmission of our policy stance throughout the euro area, we need to ensure that this repricing is not exacerbated and distorted by destabilising market dynamics, leading to a fragmentation of our original policy impulse. That risk of fragmentation is also affected by the pandemic, which has left lasting vulnerabilities in the euro area economy. These vulnerabilities are now contributing to the uneven transmission of the normalisation of our policy across jurisdictions. The Governing Council is therefore acting in two ways. First, we will use flexibility in reinvesting redemptions coming due under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) to preserve the functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. In other words, those redemptions can, as appropriate, be invested within the Eurosystem in bond markets of jurisdictions where orderly transmission is at risk. We have decided to apply this flexibility in reinvesting redemptions coming due in the PEPP portfolio as of 1 July. Second, we have decided to mandate the relevant Eurosystem committees, together with the ECB services, to accelerate the completion of the design of a new instrument for consideration by the Governing Council. The new instrument will have to be effective, while being proportionate and containing sufficient safeguards to preserve the impetus of Member States towards a sound fiscal policy. This decision lies squarely within the ECB's tradition. In the past, the ECB has made use of separate instruments to target inflation and to preserve the functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. Measures to preserve transmission could be used at any level of interest rates - so long as they were designed not to interfere with the monetary policy stance. At times when inflation fell too low, it made sense to shift from ""separation"" to ""combination"" so that all tools reinforced the required policy easing. That is why, for example, we linked asset purchases tightly to forward guidance on rates. But with high inflation now being the main challenge, there are merits in separating policy tools again. Preserving policy transmission throughout the euro area will allow rates to rise as far as necessary. In this sense, there is no trade-off between launching this new tool and adopting the necessary policy stance to stabilise inflation at our target. In fact, one enables the other. Let me conclude. The euro area is facing a complex mix of shocks which are reducing growth and pushing up inflation. In this environment, it is imperative for policymakers, within their respective mandates, to address the risks to the economic outlook. Fiscal policymakers have to play their part in reducing these risks by providing targeted and temporary support while, over the medium term, following a rules-based framework that underpins both debt sustainability and macroeconomic stabilisation. We are unwavering in our commitment to ensure that inflation returns to 2% over the medium term. We have designed a strategy to normalise our policy that allows us to respond nimbly to the high inflation environment. And we will ensure that the orderly transmission of our policy stance throughout the euro area is preserved. As Leonardo da Vinci said, ""every obstacle yields to stern resolve"". We will address every obstacle that may pose a threat to our price stability mandate.","['inflation', 'euro', 'macroeconomic', 'eurosystem', 'monetary']","['inflation euro', 'inflation continues', 'ensure inflation', 'considering inflation', 'stabilise inflation']","['inflation 2024 euro', 'inflation euro area', 'accordingly inflation euro', 'policy stance euro', 'speaking inflation euro']","['euro area economy', 'term inflation target', 'term inflation outlook', 'term inflation', 'monetary policy impulse']"
6117,r220629a_BOE,united kingdom,2022-06-29,Rowing in unison to enhance cross-border payments,cleland,0,"Cross-border sales have opened the door to a world of opportunity and eCommerce companies are eager to storm through. The expansion of international sales is not only a key growth driver for online businesses, but more essential than ever to their bottom line. Right now, cross- border transactions are becoming increasingly prevalent. In fact, 87% of merchants believe that expanding online sales into new markets is one of their company's biggest growth opportunities, according to new research in the which looked at responses from 1,000 C-level executives from 10 major global markets. As technology pushes the pace of innovation even faster, seemingly anyone in retail can seize the opportunity to become more relevant to potential buyers across the globe. Yet while the explosive rise of cross-border digital commerce has opened the door to a wealth of new opportunities, many businesses are struggling with sales strategies, logistics and more. Small businesses in particular face significant difficulties when it comes to global eCommerce. No two retailers, regions or consumers are the same, so it is critical that merchants understand the landscape. This research is designed to take a global pulse of businesses of all sizes. We looked at trends, insights and pain points around cross-border eCommerce in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of why merchants see international sales as critical to long-term success, what customers want from online shopping experiences and the key barriers to expansion. Helping merchants succeed means helping them connect the dots from where they are to where they want to be, and fine-tune their efforts to attract international customers. The Visa GME Study will help merchants of all sizes grow, drive customer engagement and increase loyalty through understanding how to best tap into the trends outlined within the research findings. As technology continues to spur innovation in eCommerce, cross-border sales are reaping the benefits of a digital-first society. In fact, 87% of executives believe their biggest growth potential lies with international online sales expansion, according to the Consumers increasingly are looking to shop across borders in search of better prices, better quality and goods that are not available in their market. That has led 2 in 3 (66%) eCommerce companies to sell products across borders. Those sales alone account for nearly a third (31%) of their revenue on average. Opportunity is going to keep growing as more digital tools increase internet availability. An overwhelming majority (88%) of executives believe that having an international presence will be essential for their company's success in the next five years. The international expansion journey can be a daunting venture with a number of challenges to overcome and little likelihood of immediate success. A vast majority of those who haven't expanded internationally (87%) haven't yet made any attempts to do so. Businesses must be prepared to overcome numerous process hurdles to enter international markets. When it comes to managing online transactions, executives are prepared for accounting for handling of taxes (52%), payment processing infrastructure (52%) and international shipping and handling (52%). But they are less prepared for international customer support (47%) and legal compliance (43%). In all cases, executives see room for improvement in these critical areas. Even the businesses that are vested in expanding their stake in cross-border sales are not certain they have the formula for success. Half (51%) of those who already sell internationally do not feel completely confident that their company knows how to maximize their international online sales. Women-led companies are making headway in cross-border expansion, too, but could make greater gains as female purchasing power is poised for continued growth internationally. At 39%, female executives trail their male peers (48%) in believing that international expansion could immediately increase their revenue. So what keeps companies from trying to break into these new markets? Key barriers to entry include shipping and logistics issues (42%) and difficulty accepting and processing foreign transactions (37%). Tied for the third spot are legal and trade issues (33%) and limited Actually getting products to consumers presents its own set of problems. The largest hurdle is still shipping and logistics (23%), followed by lack of data or analytics for international Nearly a third (30%) of companies that do not sell internationally point to a lack of data or analytics on international consumers as a barrier to their international expansion. Top barriers to entry keeping businesses from expanding into foreign markets Processing foreign transactions Limited marketing resources Despite the rapid growth of cross-border commerce, many small businesses are still standing on the sidelines due to a larger gap in resources, experience and opportunity. Small businesses (71%) are less likely to have taken any action to expand into new markets, compared to medium (90%) and large (100%) businesses. Executives at small businesses are not as eager to tie their growth strategy to international sales, perhaps because a misstep could have greater consequences. Small businesses (23%) are much more likely to disagree that having an international presence would be essential for their company's success in the next five years, compared to medium (8%) and large (5%) companies. Small businesses generally are lagging far behind in the race to share in the booming international sales. Two in five (40%) small businesses engage in cross-border trade, A product or service that is popular domestically may not have the same appeal internationally for any number of reasons, including cultural ones. Executives of small businesses (61%) are significantly more likely to not feel completely confident that their company knows how to maximize international online sales, compared to executives of Better resourced companies are more likely to have experience with international sales and are more comfortable in doing so. Small businesses (39%) are significantly more likely to say that their company is not prepared to handle international transactions, compared Small companies face an uphill struggle to compete, mainly because of knowledge and resource gaps. Almost all (92%) executives agree that business solutions favor larger businesses while ignoring smaller ones. Exploring further, those who plan to expand (98%) are far more likely to agree that business solutions favor larger businesses while ignoring smaller ones, compared to those who don't plan to expand (85%). Many companies have determined that they have maximized sales domestically and need to extend their reach globally to remain competitive. Two in three (66%) of those businesses that do not sell across borders plan to do so in the very near future to broaden their potential for international expansion. A vast majority (90%) say that they plan to expand internationally within the next three years. On the whole, executives are swinging into action to turn cross-border opportunity into reality as 87% have taken some steps to establish or expand their presence in new international markets. Many businesses have already assessed tax implications (39%), market opportunities (38%) and financial requirements (37%) and a similar number have developed The fundamentals of completing a sale -- most often a simple task, domestically -- can become complicated in an international transaction due to factors such as exchange rates and taxes. While almost four in five (79%) claim that their company is prepared to handle international transactions today, only 35% say that their company is adequately equipped to do so on a regular basis and with sustained success. The physical distances are greater, but businesses recognize that international customers want service that matches what their domestic customers receive. Quick delivery of product or service is believed to be the most important factor in successfully executing international sales (44%), followed by easy checkout (41%) and convenient payment methods (41%). Selling internationally isn't just about the money. Executives cited increased brand awareness (46%) and expanded customer base (46%) at nearly the same rate as revenue (45%) as key benefits of expanding online sales internationally. Expanding into international markets can undoubtedly improve long-term business opportunities. Other benefits of selling internationally include improved brand reputation (44%), expansion of product or service lines (43%), increased market share For many businesses, the fourth quarter often determines whether or not the year has been a success. The vast majority (86%) of eCommerce companies who made sales in Q4 of 2018 made more than a quarter of their annual revenues during that period, demonstrating that holiday time is critical for eCommerce businesses. Holidays are mostly an opportunity for domestic sales. A majority (70%) of executives report more of their holiday sales are domestic, especially in the countries where the holiday is observed such as the U.S. (71% domestic) and UK (74% domestic). But in the China/Hong Kong market it's the opposite, as 67% of companies there report more of their holiday sales are international. Increased competition from other retailers was by far considered to have the most negative impact on holiday 2019 sales by more than half (52%) of the executives. But other global events are also a factor: the U.S. / China trade war is cited most have a negative impact on holiday sales.

3224,r220701a_ECB,euro area,2022-07-01,Europe as a common shield: protecting the euro area economy from global shocks,panetta,0,"I am very pleased to be taking part in this event, even though I unfortunately cannot do so in person. I would like to thank European Parliament Secretary-General Klaus Welle for his kind invitation. As an EU institution, the ECB is accountable to the citizens of Europe via the European Parliament. And our two institutions have quickly learnt one of the key lessons of the COVID-19 crisis: physical distance need not imply intellectual distance. Thanks to technology, since the outbreak of the pandemic I have participated in several virtual hearings of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to discuss the ECB's work on a digital euro. The digital euro is a key innovation for serving the interests of Europeans in a digital world. It would provide easy, costless and safe access to central bank money for daily digital payments, just as cash does for physical transactions today. Co-legislators can ensure that the European Union supports modernisation and progress in a way that is fully aligned with European values and interests. For the digital euro, they will legislate on key aspects such as the protection of privacy and legal tender status. But the digital euro is just one example. Promoting socially desirable innovation does not only apply to technology. It also applies to institutions. We need to continuously modernise the ""technology"" that underpins the functioning of our Union, from its governance to its economic architecture. This is crucial if we are to enhance our resilience to global shocks and safeguard European sovereignty. Ultimately, this is about protecting our society and guaranteeing that it can continue to enjoy peace, freedom and prosperity in spite of the geo-economic disruptions that we are facing with Russia's aggression against Ukraine, the commodity and energy price shock and the threats to international cooperation and multilateralism. If we are to overcome these formidable challenges, we must be united. The lesson of history is that when our actions are inspired by selfishness, and we waste our human, economic and political capital on fuelling internal disputes instead of solving them, we are defeating Europe. We are dividing it, weakening its ability to face shocks and shape global outcomes. Unity, not fragmentation, makes us strong. Two years ago, at the onset of the pandemic, Jacques Delors warned that the ""germ"" of national divisions was back and that it posed a mortal danger to the European Union. His warning was heeded and our Union emerged from the pandemic stronger, with inclusive policies and innovations such as the Next Generation EU (NGEU) programme. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, EU leaders took a major step towards European integration with the Versailles Declaration of March 2022. To deliver on its strategic objectives - reducing energy dependence, bolstering defence capabilities and building a more robust economic base - we need to continue innovating. 2022 also marks the 30th anniversary of the signing of the Maastricht Treaty, which transformed the European Communities into the European Union. This Treaty contained two important innovations. First, it granted the European Parliament extended powers through the right of co-decision, thereby strengthening the democratic foundations of policymaking in the EU. Since then, the Parliament has consolidated its role in shaping the EU. Second, the Treaty enshrined the decision to form Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in law. The European Parliament is also EMU's parliament. And it has been a key promoter of the modernisation of our economic architecture in recent years, alongside the ECB and other EU institutions. So today I would like to reflect on the evolution of European economic governance and then explore the challenges facing the euro area economy and monetary policy in the new geopolitical landscape. Since the Maastricht Treaty entered into force back in 1993, progress towards EMU has been discontinuous, echoing Jean Monnet's famous statement that ""Europe will be forged in crises, and will be the sum of the solutions adopted for those crises"". The economic framework introduced by the Treaty had the specific aim of preventing economic policies from jeopardising the stability of the monetary union as a whole. But this was initially implemented mainly through preventive tools that sought to avoid excessive government spending at national level. The euro area was not prepared to manage large shocks. This weakness was laid bare by the financial crisis. The euro area adopted a flawed policy mix, causing an economic gap to emerge with other major economies. Fiscal policy - after briefly intervening to support the economy - procyclically turned towards fiscal consolidation, mainly through uncoordinated interventions that were inconsistent with the fiscal stance that would have been appropriate at European level. Between 2011 and 2013 procyclical fiscal consolidation triggered contractionary forces that also turned out to be self-defeating in terms of debt sustainability. The task of stabilising the economy fell on the ECB's monetary policy alone, forcing the euro area to undergo a slow and fragile recovery with members of EMU suffering economic losses and social distress. The procyclical policies of those years generated a political backlash. Europe was divided into creditor and debtor countries - a core and a periphery - resulting in a deep economic, social and political divide. The pandemic crisis represented a watershed in the journey of European integration. In spring 2020 European leaders recognised that a strong, common fiscal response to offset the economic damage caused by the pandemic was in the interests of all euro area countries. In particular, under the NGEU programme, a decision was taken to set up a European fiscal instrument with the necessary resources to support the recovery. This created the basis for a European social contract for exiting the pandemic: EU Member States committed to making their economies more competitive in exchange for European funding. In this way, not only would NGEU enhance medium-term growth prospects, it would also contribute to convergence. The ECB's monetary policy also responded decisively to the pandemic shock. At the outset, the COVID-19 crisis had a severe impact on the euro area economy and capital markets, bringing inflation into negative territory and threatening financial stability. Faced with this situation, the ECB adopted extraordinary measures to secure favourable financing conditions in all euro area countries. The most significant of these measures was the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), whereby the ECB - over a two-year period - purchased private and public sector securities amounting to around EUR1.7 trillion. In contrast to previous ECB asset purchase programmes, the PEPP was given the flexibility needed for purchases to be calibrated over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions. This enabled action to be directed more effectively to where the risks to monetary policy transmission were greater. Overall, the ECB's measures supported favourable financing conditions across the euro area and fended off risks of financial fragmentation. And governments were in a position to step in, offsetting lost private sector income. We have learnt two main lessons from this experience. First, situations that require a joint monetary and fiscal policy response may arise more frequently than previously thought. During the pandemic, fiscal policies and our independent monetary policy have reinforced each other. This prevented a repetition of the experience of the global financial crisis, when the procyclical amplification of financial stress and inadequate support for demand resulted in a persistent output gap, high unemployment, financial instability and too-low inflation. The second lesson is that, for EMU to be viable, European policies must be conducted for the benefit of Member States. The new model embraced by European authorities during the pandemic avoided the political divisions we saw in the past. This provided evidence of how EMU can create a virtuous circle. When we intervene at European level to counteract external shocks, when we promote responsible national fiscal and economic policies, and when we shore up the financial system against self-fulfilling risks of instability and fragmentation, we support the resilience and the progress of the entire euro area. A well-functioning EMU in turn supports the integration of European supply chains, boosting autonomy, efficiency and growth. It strengthens the international role of the euro and our collective firepower to react to external shocks. And in doing so it delivers both economic and geopolitical benefits to Europeans, acting as a collective economic defence clause. Our ability and resolve to make EMU work are again being put to the test, this time by the war in Ukraine. And macroeconomic policies are facing renewed challenges in the current geopolitical landscape. The Russian invasion of Ukraine marked a turning point for Europe and for globalisation. When European leaders met in Paris on 11 March, they described the current situation as a ""tectonic shift in European history"", with far-reaching effects on the structure and governance of the European economy. In the ensuing Versailles Declaration, they recognised Europeans' collective security as a shared public good and identified three conditions for achieving it: reducing energy dependence, bolstering defence capabilities and building a more robust economic base. The adjustment to this new state of international political and trade relations will be costly and require substantial investment. This investment is also necessary to protect our productive capacity in the face of the current shocks and to avoid a permanent loss of economic potential that could entrench inflationary pressures. In this context and responding to the mandate from the European leaders, on 18 May the European Commission presented REPowerEU, an ambitious plan that aims to reduce the EU's fossil fuel dependence on Russia to zero by 2030. huge amounts of financing are needed if we are to make the green transition a reality. Overall, reducing dependence on Russian fossil fuels and achieving the EU's 2030 climate targets will require energy-related investments of EUR500 billion per year, on average, between 2021 and 2030. Member States' defence budgets are also likely to increase significantly. And in the coming years, Europe will have to increase its investment to speed up the digital transformation and expand research and development activities, to name just a few sectors. If the responsibility for these higher investments and the associated costs were to fall exclusively on the shoulders of the individual Member States, this could lead to underinvestment, a less coherent and effective response to current shocks and a narrowing of fiscal space. Financial fragmentation could also increase as the external shocks we are facing, such as the energy shock, are impacting European economies to varying degrees. According to the theory of fiscal federalism, public goods that cannot be offered more effectively or efficiently by national governments - and for which there is broad support across Europe - should be provided by the EU. In my view, the required investment I have just outlined can be considered as such a public good. And the action points set out in the Versailles Declaration enjoy broad support among Europeans. So if we think back to those words of Jean Monnet, the current geopolitical crisis requires us to make another leap forward in the process of EU fiscal integration, recognising that it is an illusion that EMU can function smoothly without a fiscal capacity at European level to respond to such external shocks. A larger, permanent and centralised fiscal capacity, if designed appropriately, could help to address the imbalances in the institutional framework of the monetary union, in which a single monetary policy coexists with a fiscal policy that is fragmented along national lines. In the current uncertain economic landscape, this would allow us to cushion the asymmetric effects that may emerge from the common shock of the war, thereby preventing fragmentation risks. Clearly, the new economic order created by the war also poses new challenges for monetary policy. Over the past two years, our economy has been hit by an unprecedented sequence of imported supply shocks. These are pushing up inflation and depressing growth. The exit from the pandemic had already produced a sharp rise in energy and commodity prices. And the emergence of supply bottlenecks had raised the prices of durable goods. The Russian invasion of Ukraine is now exacerbating each of these individual forces. Inflation rose to 8.6% in June. In particular, energy prices were 41.9% above their levels one year earlier and food prices were 8.9% higher. Moreover, Eurosystem staff revised their baseline inflation projections up significantly in June. They foresee annual inflation at 6.8% in 2022, 3.5% in 2023 and 2.1% in 2024. This surge in prices does not reflect excess demand in the euro area. Consumption and investment remain below their pre-pandemic level and even further away from their pre-pandemic trend. With wages rising at a moderate pace, real incomes have been severely hit by the surge in import prices. Together with the war, this is further depressing consumption and confidence, despite the boost they have received from the reopening after the pandemic. Leading indicators of consumer confidence and business sentiment are deteriorating, and the growth outlook is being progressively revised downwards. Our projections now foresee activity remaining below its pre-pandemic trend throughout our projection horizon. So how should monetary policy react to this situation? Faced with persistently high inflation, we started a gradual process of policy normalisation at the end of last year. And at its meeting on 9 June the Governing Council decided to end net asset purchases under our asset purchase programme as of 1 July. We signalled that we intend to raise our policy rates by 25 basis points in July and that we expect to raise them again in September. As a result, there is already an adjustment working its way through the economy. Nominal yields and real rates have seen a material increase in recent months. Banks have started to tighten their credit conditions and expect to further tighten them markedly in the coming quarters. Given the prevailing uncertainty, normalisation should remain gradual. For now, our aim should be to avoid high near-term imported inflation becoming entrenched by feeding into higher inflation expectations. And this is why we are ending the policies that sought to fend off deflationary dynamics, such as net asset purchases and negative rates. But beyond this, further adjustments to our monetary policy stance will depend on the evolution of the outlook for inflation and the economy. At this stage, inflation expectations stand at around 2% and wage increases remain moderate. We are closely monitoring these developments. And we need to see how the economy reacts to the tightening in financing conditions and the deterioration of the global and domestic economic outlook. Faced with several external shocks that have varying impacts on the economies of the euro area, we need to ensure that our policy stance is transmitted evenly, thereby preserving the singleness of our monetary policy. Monetary policy could otherwise be impaired by an excessive, self-fulfilling market reaction leading to an asymmetric tightening of financing conditions across the euro area. Action to prevent fragmentation is therefore not at odds with the normalisation of monetary policy. On the contrary, it is a necessary condition for us to have the freedom to adjust our stance as needed to bring inflation back to 2%. This is required to ensure that the desired monetary policy stance is reflected not only in the financing conditions of countries perceived as vulnerable to fragmentation, but also in the financing conditions of the other countries. In the vulnerable countries, fragmentation would lead to capital outflows and an increase in yields, resulting in financing conditions that would be too tight. It could trigger self-fulfilling financial tensions. At the same time, the least vulnerable countries would experience capital inflows that would compress yields, resulting in financing conditions that would be too loose and inflation that would be too high compared with our intended monetary policy impulse. And this would trigger even greater divergence and undesirable outcomes that would go against our monetary policy objective. So acting against fragmentation, countering any excessive reaction by market yields to the normalisation of our monetary policy, is not just consistent with our mandate; it is necessary for us to fulfil that mandate. And it is in the interest of all euro area countries. If we didn't act, the result would be inadequate financing conditions across the euro area, with a weaker, fragmented economy and less scope for us to adjust our stance. And this would inevitably be reflected in a weaker exchange rate. Accordingly, the Governing Council decided that it will apply flexibility in reinvesting redemptions coming due in the PEPP portfolio. The aim is to avoid a situation where the lasting vulnerabilities that the pandemic has left in the euro area economy result in our monetary policy normalisation being transmitted unevenly across countries. The Governing Council also stressed more broadly that preserving the functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism is a precondition for the ECB to be able to deliver on its price stability mandate. The Governing Council therefore requested that the completion of the design of a new anti-fragmentation instrument be accelerated. Together, our decisions to adjust the stance and protect the transmission of monetary policy underpin our commitment to ensuring that inflation stabilises at our 2% target over the medium term. As President Lagarde said earlier this week, ""we will address every obstacle that may pose a threat to our price stability mandate"". Let me conclude. The war on our doorstep is a reminder of what we owe to European integration: three-quarters of a century of peace, freedom and prosperity within our Union, of openness and closer links between our economies. The Spring 2022 Eurobarometer survey commissioned by the European Parliament suggests that Russia's aggression against Ukraine has strengthened public support for the EU. Two in three Europeans see EU membership as a good thing, the highest result since 2007. We now need to protect the achievements of European integration and build on them to defend our shared interests, strengthening our Union and our economies in the face of geopolitical and geo-economic challenges. This is the spirit and the letter of the Versailles Declaration. We have a collective responsibility to bring it to life. In March 2020 the ECB's Governing Council, under the leadership of President Lagarde, took courageous decisions to protect the European economy from the potentially disruptive consequences of the pandemic shock. I am confident that we will act with the same courage and determination to preserve price stability while safeguarding European unity in the difficult circumstances we are facing today. Fiscal and economic policies will need to play their part at both European and national level to achieve the necessary transformation of our economies and address concerns of competitiveness and long-term sustainability. Protecting our collective military, energy and economic security requires substantial financing. But it requires first and foremost political investment in a common response to common shocks. The reaction to the pandemic shows that our Union is capable of providing such a response. I would like to end by highlighting the importance of your work at the European Parliament. This Parliament is the voice of the European people. It holds us to our European responsibilities. And, in recent crises, it has in many ways been Europe's conscience, unwavering in calling for ambitious responses to the multiple challenges we face.","['eu', 'eurosystem', 'euro', 'eurobarometer', 'european']","['euro digital', 'digital euro', 'achieving eu', 'crisis euro', 'safeguarding european']","['digital euro legislate', 'interests digital euro', 'challenges facing euro', 'euro digital euro', 'status digital euro']","['digital euro', 'next generation eu', 'other eu institutions', 'european commission', 'european economic governance']"

3226,r220704a_ECB,euro area,2022-07-04,Challenges for monetary policy,guindos,0,"Having participated in the previous two summits, it is a great pleasure to speak with you again this year. In my remarks today, I will first discuss the economic outlook for the euro area. I will then turn to the ECB's recent monetary policy decisions and look at why an even transmission of our monetary policy is vital to the achievement of our price stability mandate. Over the first half of this year, euro area inflation has continued to rise and has reached undesirably high levels. In June headline inflation rose to 8.6%, another record high, continuing to reflect surging energy and food prices, owing in part to Russia's unjustified invasion of Ukraine. But price increases have not been limited to energy and food. In recent months we have seen inflationary pressures broaden and intensify across many goods and services. Elevated inflation will remain with us for some time, declining to just above target only at the end of our projection horizon. We expect that moderating energy costs, the easing of supply disruptions related to the pandemic and the normalisation of monetary policy will be conducive to inflation returning to our 2% target over the medium term. But the risks surrounding inflation are on the upside. Economic activity is in turn affected by the war and its consequences. Rising prices are reducing disposable incomes, while intensified supply disruptions and greater uncertainty are also weighing on growth, particularly in the manufacturing sector. At the same time, developments in the services sector are supporting growth, with the lifting of pandemic-related restrictions and signs of a buoyant summer tourism season boosting activity. These developments are bolstering incomes and consumption, helping an already strong labour market to withstand the economic impact of the war. Our projections foresee growth above 2% throughout the projection horizon. But the war and the risk of further disruption in the energy supply to the euro area continues to be a significant downside risk to growth. In fact, the downside scenario in our June projections reflects this risk and implies a contraction of activity in 2023, following weaker but positive growth in 2022. While we are still expecting positive growth rates throughout our projection horizon, in the coming months we will have to navigate this challenging combination of shocks which is reducing growth and pushing up inflation. The Governing Council has a steadfast and unwavering commitment to its medium-term inflation target of 2%. On the basis of our updated assessment, we decided at our meeting on 9 June to take further steps towards normalising our monetary policy. First, we decided to end net asset purchases under our asset purchase programme as of last Friday, 1 July. Second, we announced our intention to raise the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points at our July monetary policy meeting and to raise them again in September. The size of the interest rate increase in September will depend on the updated medium-term inflation outlook - if the medium-term inflation outlook persists or deteriorates, an increment of more than 25 basis points will be appropriate. Third, looking further ahead, we indicated that a gradual but sustained path of further increases in interest rates will be appropriate, based on our current assessment. The pace at which we adjust our monetary policy will depend on the incoming data and how we assess inflation to be developing in the medium term, in line with our commitment to our target of 2% over the medium term. Wage increases and developments in inflation expectations need to be monitored closely, as they will be crucial for our deliberations beyond September. Let me stress that, ever since the gradual process of policy normalisation was initiated in December 2021, the Governing Council has pledged to act against potential fragmentation risks. Accordingly, the Governing Council decided on 15 June that we will apply flexibility in reinvesting redemptions coming due under the pandemic emergency purchase programme with a view to preserving the functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism, a precondition for the ECB to be able to deliver on its price stability mandate. We also tasked the Eurosystem committees, together with ECB staff, with accelerating the completion of a new anti-fragmentation instrument for consideration by the Governing Council. Fiscal policy should do its part by guaranteeing sound public finances in the medium term and delivering targeted and temporary support to vulnerable groups in the short run. The smooth and even transmission of our monetary policy across the euro area is required to preserve the singleness of monetary policy and achieve our mandate of price stability. Changes in financing conditions that go beyond the level merited by fundamental factors undermine the achievement of that objective. Sovereign bond yields are an important reference point for assessing the transmission of our policy stance because they act as a benchmark for determining the financing conditions for firms and households. It is natural for sovereign yields to differ somewhat across euro area countries, owing to idiosyncratic factors, such as public debt-to-GDP ratios, budget deficits or long-run growth rates. However, at times yields can, and do, rapidly diverge from economic fundamentals. Excessive divergence makes credit conditions inconsistent with the uniform transmission of monetary policy impulses and could cause financial instability. It is instead critical that financing conditions move broadly in sync across the euro area when we change our stance. For two equally sound firms in the euro area, a change in the monetary policy stance should lead to a similar reaction in their financing conditions, no matter in which country they are domiciled. Should that not be the case, we will react to prevent fragmentation, with suitable safeguards to prevent moral hazard. Preventing fragmentation allows us to adjust our monetary policy stance at the appropriate pace and stabilise inflation at our target. The headwinds from high energy costs, the deterioration of terms of trade and the adverse impact of high inflation on disposable income pose elevated risks to our medium-term growth outlook. Inflation has risen further in June and is likely to remain at high levels in the near term. To make sure that inflation returns to its 2% target, we are continuing to move along our monetary policy normalisation path. As we do so, we will continue to use the flexibility necessary to counter any threats to monetary policy transmission and facilitate the achievement our target. Our commitment to fight fragmentation should thus not interfere with, but rather enable, a greater focus on the monetary policy stance.","['inflation', 'inflationary', 'euro', 'eurosystem', 'monetary']","['pushing inflation', 'inflation continued', 'stabilise inflation', 'elevated inflation', 'surrounding inflation']","['euro area inflation', 'stabilise inflation target', 'elevated inflation remain', 'monetary policy euro', 'pushing inflation governing']","['euro area inflation', 'stabilise inflation', 'elevated inflation', 'high inflation', 'inflation']"
6118,r220706a_BOE,united kingdom,2022-07-06,Returning inflation to target,pill,0,"Monetary policy at the Bank of England The Committee's updated central projections for activity and inflation are set out in the accompanying February . The projections are conditioned on a market-implied path for Bank Rate that rises to around 1 1/2 % by the middle of 2023. Wholesale energy prices are assumed to follow their respective futures curves for the first six months of the projections and remain constant beyond that, in contrast to futures curves, which are downward sloping over coming years. There are material risks around this assumption. Global and UK activity returned to their pre-Covid-19 (Covid) levels towards the end of last year. The emergence of the Omicron variant is expected to have depressed activity somewhat in December and January. But its economic impact is likely to be limited and of short duration, and UK GDP is expected to recover in February and March such that output returns to its pre-pandemic level once again by the end of the first quarter. The Labour Force Survey unemployment rate fell to 4.1% in the three months to November, and is expected to fall further in the near term, Beyond the near term, UK GDP growth is expected to slow to subdued rates. The main reason for that is the adverse impact of higher global energy and tradable goods prices on UK real aggregate income and spending. As a result, the unemployment rate is expected to rise to 5% and excess supply builds to around 1% by the end of the forecast period. Underlying earnings growth is estimated to have remained above pre-pandemic rates, and is expected to strengthen over the coming year, to around 4 3/4 %. This is consistent with the results of the Bank's Agents' annual pay survey, with the tight labour market, and with some temporary upward pressure on wage settlements from higher price inflation. Twelve-month CPI inflation rose from 5.1% in November to 5.4% in December, almost 1 percentage point higher than expected at the time of the November . Inflation is expected to increase further in coming months, to close to 6% in February and March, before peaking at around 7 1/4 % in April. This projected peak is around 2 percentage points higher than expected in the November . The projected overshoot of inflation relative to the 2% target mainly reflects global energy and tradable goods prices. The further rise in energy futures prices meant that Ofgem's utility price caps were expected to be substantially higher at the reset in April 2022. Core goods CPI inflation is also expected to rise further, due to the impact of global bottlenecks on tradable goods prices. central projection, upward pressures on CPI inflation are expected to dissipate over time, as global energy prices are assumed to remain constant after six months, and as global bottlenecks ease and tradable goods prices fall back a little. Underlying wage growth is also projected to ease from 2023, as the labour market loosens gradually and inflation declines. Conditioned on the rising market-implied path for Bank Rate and the MPC's current forecasting convention for future energy prices, CPI inflation is projected to fall back to a little above the 2% target in two years' time and to below the target by a greater margin in three years. In an alternative scenario that is conditioned on energy prices following forward curves throughout the forecast period and as set out in the February , excess supply is around 1/2 percentage point lower in the medium term than in the MPC's central projection, and CPI inflation is around 3/4 percentage point below the 2% target in two and three years' time. The MPC's remit is clear that the inflation target applies at all times, reflecting the primacy of price stability in the UK monetary policy framework. The framework also recognises that there will be occasions when inflation will depart from the target as a result of shocks and disturbances. In the recent unprecedented circumstances, the economy has been subject to very large and repeated shocks. In particular, should recent movements prove persistent, the sharp rises in prices of global energy and tradable goods of which the United Kingdom is a net importer will necessarily weigh on UK real aggregate income and spending. This is something monetary policy is unable to prevent. The role of monetary policy is to ensure that, as such a real economic adjustment occurs, it does so consistent with achieving the 2% inflation target sustainably in the medium term, while minimising undesirable volatility in output. Given the current tightness of the labour market and continuing signs of greater persistence in domestic cost and price pressures, the Committee judges that an increase in Bank Rate of 0.25 percentage points is warranted at this meeting. Consistent with the MPC's guidance set out in the August 2021 , the Committee agrees at this meeting that the Bank of England should cease to reinvest any future maturities falling due from its stock of UK government bond purchases. This reflects the MPC's intention to reduce its holdings of government bonds in a gradual and predictable manner. In addition, the Committee agrees that the Bank of England should cease to reinvest any maturities falling due from its stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, and that it should initiate a programme of corporate bond sales to be completed no earlier than towards the end of 2023 that should unwind fully the stock of corporate bond purchases. The decision to initiate the programme of corporate bond sales reflects the specific characteristics of the corporate bond market and the MPC's involvement in it, and should not be taken as a signal regarding the commencement, scale or duration of any potential future UK government bond sales programme. The Committee reaffirms that it will consider beginning the process of actively selling UK government bonds only once Bank Rate has risen to at least 1%, and depending on economic circumstances at the time. The Committee also reaffirms its preference in most circumstances to use Bank Rate as its active policy tool when adjusting the stance of monetary policy. The extent of any further tightening in monetary policy will depend on the medium-term prospects for inflation. The MPC judges that, if the economy develops broadly in line with the February central projections, some further modest tightening in monetary policy is likely to be appropriate in the coming months. The Committee continues to judge that there are two-sided risks around the medium-term inflation outlook, primarily from wage developments on the upside and from energy and global tradable goods prices on the downside. The Committee will update its assessment on the balance of the risks to medium-term inflation in light of the relevant data as they emerge. UK-weighted world GDP returned to its pre-Covid peak in 2021 Q3. Bank staff estimate that it grew by 0.8% in 2021 Q4, broadly as expected in the November 2021 but lower than in Q3. Activity in many countries was affected by an increase in Covid cases (Section 2.1). Supply chain disruption in global goods markets also appears to have continued to constrain output in some sectors (Box B). UK GDP grew by 1.1% in the three months to November and the level of activity was around 1% higher than projected at the time of the last . Monthly GDP regained its pre-Covid level, which partly reflected government sector output being around 6% above its pre-pandemic peak. Private sector activity remained slightly below its pre-Covid level, with many businesses reporting that shortages of materials, components or labour were limiting their output UK GDP is expected to have fallen in December and January as a result of the emergence of Omicron. Measures to control the spread of the virus and voluntary social distancing are thought to have lowered consumer spending, especially in retail and recreational venues. This is consistent with the evidence from high-frequency spending indicators. There has also been some impact on labour supply, with some staff unable to work because of sickness or self-isolation. The economic impact of Omicron is expected to be limited and of short duration. Covid cases in the UK have fallen from their peak and many measures to control its spread have subsequently been ended. Bank staff expect GDP to recover in February and March, such that the average level of GDP over Q1 is likely to be similar to Q4. UK unemployment has continued to fall since the last , despite the closure of the Government's 0.4 percentage points lower than expected in the November . Demand for workers remains robust, with vacancies at a record high in the three months to December. Bank staff expect unemployment to fall a little further in the very near term. The tightening labour market has put upward pressure on salaries for new staff and pay settlements for existing staff. Respondents to the Bank Agents' pay survey expect wage settlements to increase significantly in 2022 (Section 3). CPI inflation was 5.4% in December, up from 3.1% in September and 0.6% a year earlier. Almost half of the rise in inflation over 2021 reflected the direct impact of higher energy prices (Section 2.4). Inflation rates for goods have also increased, due to the bottlenecks in supply. Services price inflation has also risen, though to a much lesser extent than goods price inflation. Its increase partly reflects changes to VAT for the hospitality sector, although services price inflation has risen in other sectors too. CPI inflation is expected to increase to and peak at around 7 1/4 % in April, much higher than expected at the time of the . Three quarters of the rise between December and April reflects higher contributions from energy and goods prices. Based on Ofgem's published method for calculating energy price caps, recent developments mean that household gas and electricity prices will rise materially in April and by more than expected in the November . The economic outlook continues to be affected by the evolution of the pandemic. The economic impact of the Omicron variant on UK and global activity is expected to be limited and of short duration and many of the measures to restrict its spread have been lifted across the UK over the past few weeks (Section 2). The MPC's projections are conditioned on the assumptions that no material measures to control the pandemic that might lower economic activity are reimposed and there is no further widespread voluntary social distancing following this wave. The fiscal stance is assumed to evolve in line with announced policies. In its in October 2021, the Government announced a higher path for government consumption, particularly over the next couple of years. When combined with the estimated effects of the measures announced since the beginning of the pandemic, fiscal policy in aggregate is projected to continue to support UK demand, especially in the near term. The policy stance gradually tightens over time in line with announced government policy, so the support from fiscal policy wanes. In line with the MPC's convention, the forecast is conditioned on the paths for policy rates implied by financial markets. Over the past three months, market rates have increased in a number of advanced economies, particularly ). In the UK, the market path as shown by the 15-day average to 26 January suggests that Bank Rate was expected to reach nearly 1.5% in mid-2023, around 25 basis points higher, on average, than in Also in line with the MPC's convention, the forecast is conditioned on an assumption that energy prices remain constant beyond six months. Energy prices have been volatile recently, and remain much higher than a year earlier. Based on the 15-day average to 26 January, sterling oil prices were almost 90% above their 2020 Q4 level, and UK wholesale gas prices almost 400% higher. Higher gas prices have also led to a sharp pickup in wholesale electricity prices, which rose by over 300% over this period. Energy futures curves are also higher over the next year than in November. The rises in energy prices and futures curves reflect strong demand and rising geopolitical tensions. In its projections, the MPC's conditioning assumption is that oil, gas and electricity prices follow their respective futures curves for the first six months of the forecast period, and beyond that remain constant (as set out in Box 5 of ). These assumptions for wholesale energy prices feed into Bank staff forecasts for retail gas and electricity prices, based on the current method used by the UK's energy regulator, Ofgem, to set tariff caps. Those caps are updated twice a year in April and October. Based on Ofgem's published method for calculating the price caps, the latest developments suggest that household utility prices will rise by close to 50% in April. UK-weighted world GDP is estimated to have surpassed its pre-pandemic level in the second half of last year as the global economy recovered from the effects of Covid. Evidence from countries furthest ahead in the Omicron wave suggests that case rates are likely to fall sooner and faster than in previous waves (Section 2.1). The economic impact of Omicron is therefore expected to be limited and to have largely dissipated in Q2, though the effects will vary across countries, in part reflecting progress on vaccinations. In the MPC's projections, global activity continues to grow thereafter, but is restrained by higher global energy prices over the forecast period. Activity is also held back by the impact of ongoing supply chain constraints for tradable goods (Box B). These constraints are expected to ease gradually over the next year, so their downward impact on activity fades over this period, as does the upward pressure on global tradable goods prices a little later. Annual UK-weighted world GDP growth is projected to slow from around 5% in 2021 to 3 1/4 % in 2022. It slows further to around pre-Covid rates towards the end of the forecast period, with growth in 2024 around 2 1/4 % ( Global inflationary pressures have continued to build significantly, largely driven by the sharp increases in energy prices and the upward impact of the imbalance between the supply of and demand for tradable goods on their prices. On a UK-weighted basis, four-quarter world export price inflation, including energy, is expected to have risen to around 11% in 2021 Q4. These global pressures are the primary reason why consumer price inflation is elevated in many countries. World export prices are projected to rise a little further in the near term, given further upward pressure from global bottlenecks. Demand, particularly in the US, is then expected to shift gradually away from durable goods to services. Together with an expected increase in the supply of these goods, global bottlenecks ease and tradable goods prices fall a little over the forecast period, though the latter remain well above their pre-pandemic levels. Together with the assumption that global energy prices remain constant beyond six months, four-quarter world export price inflation, including energy, is expected to fall sharply and turn negative early next year. This takes time to feed through to global consumer price inflation, which falls back more slowly. Four-quarter UK GDP growth is estimated to have been 6.4% in 2021 Q4, with monthly output regaining its pre-pandemic level in November, as the impact of Covid continued to dissipate and spending was supported by monetary and fiscal policy ( . The pace of expansion eases over the projection, driven mainly by slower growth in demand. Four-quarter GDP growth slows to around 1% in the second and third years of the forecast period ( In projections conditioned on the alternative assumption of constant interest rates at 0.5%, GDP growth is somewhat stronger than in the MPC's forecasts conditioned on market rates ( The prices of global energy and tradable goods have risen sharply. The UK is a net importer of energy and tradable goods, so overall, under the assumption that global energy prices remain constant beyond six months, this will lower UK real aggregate income and spending. Over the forecast period, consumption growth slows, as households cut back on spending in the face of the material adverse effects on their real incomes from the sharp rises in global energy and tradable goods prices, and the planned increase in national insurance contributions in April 2022. Four-quarter household real labour income growth is expected to have slowed sharply at the end of 2021 and is projected to be negative in 2022 and 2023 ( Although consumption growth therefore slows materially over the first two years of the forecast period, it does so by less than income growth. That reflects the assumption, similar to previous projections, that households spend some of the significant additional savings they have accumulated, in aggregate, during the pandemic. As a result, the household saving rate falls from 8.3% in 2021 Q3 to below 4% at the turn of this year ( Business investment picks up over the next year and then falls back in the second half of the forecast period, as some spending is brought forward, given the support from the Government's capital allowance super-deduction in the near term. Contacts of the Bank's Agents have reported that their capital spending is currently below their relatively strong investment intentions as firms postpone projects given the sharp rises in global energy and goods prices and as global bottlenecks continue to limit supplies of their inputs (Box D). Demand growth also slows over the projection as the support from fiscal and monetary policy wanes gradually as both Temporary supply disruptions for certain tradable goods weigh on UK output over the next year, contributing to a slowing in supply growth in 2022. As set out in the November , thereafter supply growth is projected to settle at around 1 1/2 % - similar to the rates seen before Covid. Within that, labour supply growth is modest, while productivity growth settles at around 1%. As the economy has recovered from the effects of Covid, both demand and supply have picked up rapidly, and it is difficult to judge the balance between them. Moreover, there have been material differences in the paths of the recovery between sectors of the economy, which can make the aggregate picture hard to assess. Those different paths have resulted in supply bottlenecks arising in some industries, while activity in other sectors has been less constrained. Most indicators of the balance of demand and supply in the economy suggest that there is currently a small margin of excess demand across the economy as a whole. The labour market has tightened rapidly, with the unemployment rate having fallen below the MPC's assessment of the medium-term equilibrium rate of unemployment, despite the end of the furlough scheme in September 2021. Firms also continue to report significant recruitment difficulties and elevated levels of vacancies, and some surveys suggest above-average levels of capacity utilisation. On balance, the MPC judges that there is a small margin of excess demand in the economy at present, with some differences across sectors. The MPC expects demand to grow more slowly than potential supply over the projection, particularly in the near term. As a result, unemployment is expected to start to rise in 2022 Q2 ( ). Conditioned on the assumptions above, including the market path for interest rates, a margin of excess supply emerges at the end of 2022 and builds over the forecast period to around 1% ( ). In part, that is accounted for by some slack in the labour market, with unemployment rising to around 5% by the end of the projection. In projections conditioned on the alternative assumption of constant interest rates at 0.5%, unemployment remains close to its current rate over the forecast period, instead of rising by around 1 precentage point, as in the MPC's forecast conditional on market rates ( CPI inflation is projected to rise further in the near term from 5.4% in December to a peak of 7 1/4 % in April 2022. That, and the overshoot of inflation relative to the 2% inflation target, mainly reflects the sharp increases in global prices, with around three quarters of the rise in inflation between December and April due to higher contributions from energy and goods prices. The further rise in energy futures prices since the utility tariff caps were last set by Ofgem in October 2021 means that the caps are likely to be substantially higher when they are reset in April 2022. Food price inflation is also expected to increase in coming months, given higher input costs. Informed by evidence from the Agents' pay survey that wage settlements are expected to be much higher in 2022 than in 2021 (Section 3), underlying private sector wage growth is projected to rise somewhat further to around 4 3/4 % over the next year, given the recent tightening in the labour market. Consistent with the Agents' survey, higher inflation is also assumed to put some upward pressure on wage growth over this period but the effects do not persist thereafter. These stronger underlying domestic cost pressures put further upward pressure on CPI inflation this year. That is consistent with evidence from the Agents' survey that some firms have started to pass through part of the rise in their labour costs to their prices and that they and other firms will try to do so over the next year to rebuild their margins. Whole-economy average weekly earnings (AWE) growth is expected to be somewhat lower than underlying wage growth over the next year ( ), given an expected drag from compositional effects (Section 3). The direct contribution from energy prices to CPI inflation is expected to peak at around 2 1/4 percentage points in Q2 and to fall to zero by the end of 2023 ( ). Goods price inflation is also expected to fall back reflecting an easing of global imbalances between demand and supply for tradable goods (Box B). Four-quarter whole-economy AWE growth falls back from 3 3/4 % at the end of this year to 2 1/4 % at the end of the forecast period, as unemployment rises and CPI inflation falls back. In line with the MPC's conventions, the forecast is conditioned on the path of Bank Rate implied by financial markets, which rises to nearly 1 1/2 % by mid-2023, and energy prices remaining constant beyond six months. On this basis, after the peak in April, CPI inflation is projected to fall back as the contribution from energy prices fades, global bottlenecks ease, and domestic cost pressures lessen somewhat as demand weakens and unemployment rises. CPI inflation is a little above the 2% target in two years' time, and is below the target by a greater margin in three years ( In projections conditioned on the alternative assumption of constant interest rates at 0.5%, CPI inflation is projected to be 2.6% and 2.1% in two years and three years' time respectively, higher than in the Committee's forecast conditioned on market rates ( The level of UK GDP is expected to be around 3/4 % lower than in November, on average, over the forecast period. That mainly reflects the adverse impact on UK real aggregate income and spending of the further increases in global energy and tradable goods prices. To a lesser extent, the lower expected path of GDP also reflects the impact of the higher market path for interest rates. Unemployment has fallen and the labour market has tightened by more than expected in November. But unemployment is higher from the start of 2023, reflecting the weaker outlook for demand. As a result, excess supply builds by more over the forecast period than in November. The further recent rises in enrgy futures curves account for much of the upward revision to the projection for CPI inflation over the first year of the forecast period. In particular, the sharp rise in forward wholesale gas prices since November has resulted in a higher projection for retail energy prices from 2022 Q2, when tariff caps are next updated by Ofgem. The MPC's projections are also based on an assumption that global bottlenecks will put more upward pressure on global tradable goods prices in the near term than in November. This also exerts some further upward pressure on CPI inflation over the next year. Global tradable goods prices put some downward pressure on CPI inflation further ahead, as the MPC now judges that they will fall back a little over the projection. Underlying wage growth is materially stronger than in November over the coming year, given the greater tightening in the labour market than expected, higher inflation and the evidence on expected pay settlements in 2022 from the As a result of these factors, the projection for CPI inflation is materially stronger than in November over the first two years of the forecast period, and slightly lower in the third year. The Committee voted for the Bank of England to begin to reduce the stock of UK government bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, by ceasing to reinvest maturing assets. The Committee also voted for the Bank of England to begin to reduce the stock of sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, by ceasing to reinvest maturing assets and by a programme of corporate bond sales to be completed no earlier than towards the end of 2023 that should unwind fully the stock of corporate bond purchases. The factors behind these decisions are set out in the Monetary Policy Summary on pages i-ii of this and in more detail in the Minutes of the meeting. As set out in Box 5 of the August 2019 , the MPC's forecasts are conditioned on paths for oil, gas and electricity prices which follow their respective futures curves for the first six months of the projection, and beyond that remain constant. Given the shape of those futures curves beyond the six-month point ( ) this implies that the assumed paths of wholesale energy prices are significantly above the futures curves. There are significant risks around these paths. The risks around global energy prices are broadly balanced in the near term. There are upside risks if there is a greater escalation of geopolitical tensions and downside risks if these are resolved more quickly. Higher energy prices would further restrain growth in global and UK activity and put more upward pressure on consumer price inflation over the next year or so, and vice versa if energy prices are lower. Further ahead, there are downside risks to energy prices, if prices fall back to the more normal levels implied by futures curves. In that case, the level of GDP would be 3/4 % higher by the end of the forecast period and excess supply and unemployment around 1/2 percentage point lower. CPI inflation would fall back towards the target more rapidly than in the central projection and would be around 3/4 percentage points below the target in two and three years' time In the MPC's central projection, world export prices rise a little further in 2022 H1, reflecting upward pressure from global bottlenecks. World export prices then fall back a little as these effects fade, though prices remain well above their pre-pandemic levels at the end of the forecast period. There are risks around this judgement. In the near term, global bottlenecks could persist for longer if the impact of the Omicron variant is bigger and more persistent in some countries than expected. That could delay the demand rotation away from goods and back towards services and cause greater supply chain disruption. In its central projection, the MPC has assumed localised restrictions are sufficient for China to implement its zero-Covid policy. If more widespread restrictions are necessary, that would disrupt global supply chains to a greater extent than assumed. This would further constrain global and UK GDP growth and put more upward pressure on world export and consumer price inflation over the next year. There are indications that some global bottlenecks may be stabilising, for example from measures of delivery times and shipping costs (Box B). If they ease by more than expected, for example if supply adjusts by more than assumed to stronger demand for durable goods, global goods prices could fall closer to their pre-pandemic levels over the forecast period. This could mean UK import and consumer price inflation fall and GDP, including business investment, increase to a greater extent than projected. UK demand growth slows over the forecast period, largely reflecting lower growth in real aggregate income and spending following the large rises in global energy and tradable goods prices and, to a lesser extent, fading support from fiscal and monetary policy, as both evolve in line with their conditioning assumptions. There are risks around those conditioning assumptions and around the expected path of demand more generally. Demand growth could slow by more than expected if households cut back on their spending by more than assumed in the face of the squeeze in their real incomes. In aggregate, households have accumulated significant additional savings during the pandemic, which should support their ability to temporarily smooth consumption as real incomes decline. But this increase in savings has not occurred evenly across households and so not all of them may be able to do this. Energy bills form a larger share of lower-income households' spending, so their ability to use savings to support their consumption may be limited. In addition, the associated deterioration in the economic outlook may increase households' and firms' uncertainty about the future, leading them to increase their precautionary saving and lower their spending further. If energy prices fall by more than is assumed in the MPC's central projections, demand growth will be stronger (Key judgement 1). Consumer spending could also be stronger than projected if households believe that the rises in global energy and tradable goods prices are likely to reverse quickly or they spend more of the additional savings they have accumulated, in aggregate, during the pandemic. Labour participation is below its pre-Covid levels. So another upside risk is that some of those who have recently left the labour market return to work to support their income in the face of the real income squeeze. This would also increase the supply capacity of the economy and moderate the impact on inflation. From the middle of this year, demand grows by less in the central projection than the MPC's assumed growth in supply, such that unemployment starts to rise in 2022 Q2 and picks up to 5%, the labour market gradually loosens and excess supply builds to 1% by the end of the projection ( Unemployment would be higher, the labour market looser and excess supply greater than expected if the downside risks to the demand outlook set out in Key judgement 2 materialised, and vice versa if the upside risks crystallised. As set out in Key judgement 1, there are downside risks to the UK's supply capacity in the near term from global bottlenecks and upside risks to supply from them further ahead. After growing rapidly as the economy recovered from the effects of Covid, supply growth is projected to slow to around 1 1/2 % in the second half of the forecast period. That is similar to the rates seen before Covid. As set out in the November , there are significant risks around the paths for labour supply and productivity growth underpinning this projection in both directions. Any changes in supply growth would be likely to feed through to demand growth over time, through their effects on household incomes, for example. The degree of uncertainty around the outlook remains unusually high. Overall, the risks to the MPC's UK GDP growth projection are judged to be slightly to the upside, given upside risks to wage and household consumption growth There are significant risks around the central projection for CPI inflation from both global factors, set out in Key judgement 1, and domestic cost pressures, set out here. In the MPC's central projection, underlying wage growth initially remains strong given the recent tightening in the labour market and some temporary upward pressure from higher price inflation. Thereafter wage growth moderates, in part, as demand weakens due to the squeeze in real incomes from higher energy and tradable goods prices. Unemployment rises and firms' ability to raise prices lessens. CPI inflation falls back to a little above the 2% target in two years' time and below the target by a greater margin in three years.

7667,r220708a_FOMC,united states,2022-07-08,Crypto-Assets and Decentralized Finance through a Financial Stability Lens,brainard,0,"Recent volatility has exposed serious vulnerabilities in the crypto financial system. While touted as a fundamental break from traditional finance, the crypto financial system turns out to be susceptible to the same risks that are all too familiar from traditional finance, such as leverage, settlement, opacity, and maturity and liquidity transformation. As we work to future-proof our financial stability agenda, it is important to ensure the regulatory perimeter encompasses crypto finance. New technology often holds the promise of increasing competition in the financial system, reducing transaction costs and settlement times, and channeling investment to productive new uses. But early on, new products and platforms are often fraught with risks, including fraud and manipulation, and it is important and sometimes difficult to distinguish between hype and value. If past innovation cycles are any guide, in order for distributed ledgers, smart contracts, programmability, and digital assets to fulfill their potential to bring competition, efficiency, and speed, it will be essential to address the basic risks that beset all forms of finance. These risks include runs, fire sales, deleveraging, interconnectedness, and contagion, along with fraud, manipulation, and evasion. In addition, it is important to be on the lookout for the possibility of new forms of risks, since many of the technological innovations underpinning the crypto ecosystem are relatively novel. Far from stifling innovation, strong regulatory guardrails will help enable investors and developers to build a resilient digital native financial infrastructure. Strong  regulatory guardrails will help banks, payments providers, and financial technology companies (FinTechs) improve the customer experience, make settlement faster, reduce costs, and allow for rapid product improvement and customization. We are closely monitoring recent events where risks in the system have crystallized and many crypto investors have suffered losses. Despite significant investor losses, the crypto financial system does not yet appear to be so large or so interconnected with the traditional financial system as to pose a systemic risk. So this is the right time to ensure that like risks are subject to like regulatory outcomes and like disclosure so as to help investors distinguish between genuine, responsible innovation and the false allure of seemingly easy returns that obscures significant risk. This is the right time to establish which crypto activities are permissible for regulated entities and under what constraints so that spillovers to the core financial system remain well contained. Several important insights have emerged from the recent turbulence in the crypto- finance ecosystem. First, volatility in financial markets has provided important information about crypto's performance as an asset class. It was already clear that crypto-assets are volatile, and we continue to see wild swings in crypto-asset values. The price of Bitcoin has dropped by as much as 75 percent from its all-time high over the past seven months, and it has declined almost 60 percent in the three months from April through June. Most other prominent crypto-assets have experienced even steeper declines over the same period. Contrary to claims that crypto-assets are a hedge to inflation or an uncorrelated asset class, crypto-assets have plummeted in value and have  proven to be highly correlated with riskier equities and with risk appetite more generally. Second, the Terra crash reminds us how quickly an asset that purports to maintain a stable value relative to fiat currency can become subject to a run. The collapse of Terra and the previous failures of several other unbacked algorithmic stablecoins are reminiscent of classic runs throughout history. New technology and financial engineering cannot by themselves convert risky assets into safe ones. Third, crypto platforms are highly vulnerable to deleveraging, fire sales, and contagion--risks that are well known from traditional finance--as illustrated by the freeze on withdrawals at some crypto lending platforms and exchanges and the bankruptcy of a prominent crypto hedge fund. Some retail investors have found their accounts frozen and suffered large losses. Large crypto players that used leverage to boost returns are scrambling to monetize their holdings, missing margin calls, and facing possible insolvency. As their distress intensifies, it has become clear that the crypto ecosystem is tightly interconnected, as many smaller traders, lenders, and DeFi (decentralized finance) protocols have concentrated exposures to these big players. Finally, we have seen how decentralized lending, which relies on overcollateralization to substitute for intermediation, can serve as a stress amplifier by creating waves of liquidations as prices fall.  The recent turbulence and losses among retail investors in crypto highlight the urgent need to ensure compliance with existing regulations and to fill any gaps where regulations or enforcement may need to be tailored--for instance, for decentralized protocols and platforms. As we consider how to address the potential future financial stability risks of the evolving crypto financial system, it is important to start with strong basic regulatory foundations. A good macroprudential framework builds on a solid foundation of microprudential regulation. Future financial resilience will be greatly enhanced if we ensure the regulatory perimeter encompasses the crypto financial system and reflects the principle of same risk, same disclosure, same regulatory outcome. By extending the perimeter and applying like regulatory outcomes and like transparency to like risks, it will enable regulators to more effectively address risks within crypto markets and potential risks posed by crypto markets to the broader financial system. Strong guardrails for safety and soundness, market integrity, and investor and consumer protection will help ensure that new digital finance products, platforms, and activities are based on genuine economic value and not on regulatory evasion, which ultimately leaves investors more exposed than they may appreciate. Due to the cross-sectoral and cross-border scope of crypto platforms, exchanges, and activities, it is important that regulators work together domestically and internationally to maintain a stable financial system and address regulatory evasion. The same-risk-same-regulatory-outcome principle guides the Financial Stability Board's work on stablecoins, crypto-assets, and DeFi; the Basel consultation on the prudential treatment of crypto-assets; the work by the International Organization of Securities  Commissions' FinTech network; the work by federal bank regulatory agencies on the appropriate treatment of crypto activities at U.S. banks; and a host of other international and domestic work. In implementing a same-risk-same-regulatory-outcome principle, we should start by ensuring basic protections are in place for consumers and investors. Retail users should be protected against exploitation, undisclosed conflicts of interest, and market manipulation--risks to which they are particularly vulnerable, according to a host of research. If investors lack these basic protections, these markets will be vulnerable to runs. Second, since trading platforms play a critical role in crypto-asset markets, it is important to address noncompliance and any gaps that may exist. We have seen crypto- trading platforms and crypto-lending firms not only engage in activities similar to those in traditional finance without comparable regulatory compliance, but also combine  activities that are required to be separated in traditional financial markets. For example, some platforms combine market infrastructure and client facilitation with risk-taking businesses like asset creation, proprietary trading, venture capital, and lending. Third, all financial institutions, whether in traditional finance or crypto finance, must comply with the rules designed to combat money laundering and financing of terrorism and to support economic sanctions. Platforms and exchanges should be designed in a manner that facilitates and supports compliance with these laws. The permissionless exchange of assets and tools that obscure the source of funds not only facilitate evasion, but also increase the risk of theft, hacks, and ransom attacks. These risks are particularly prominent in decentralized exchanges that are designed to avoid the use of intermediaries responsible for know-your-customer identification and that may require adaptations to ensure compliance at this most foundational layer. Finally, it is important to address any regulatory gaps and to adapt existing approaches to novel technologies. While regulatory frameworks clearly apply to DeFi activities no less than to centralized crypto activities and traditional finance, DeFi protocols may present novel challenges that may require adapting existing approaches. The peer-to-peer nature of these activities, their automated nature, the immutability of code once deployed to the blockchain, the exercise of governance functions through tokens in decentralized autonomous organizations, the absence of validated identities, and  the dispersion or obfuscation of control may make it challenging to hold intermediaries accountable. It is not yet clear that digital native approaches, such as building in automated incentives for undertaking governance responsibilities, are adequate alternatives. There are two specific areas that merit heightened attention because of heightened risks of spillovers to the core financial system: bank involvement in crypto activities and stablecoins. To date, crypto has not become sufficiently interconnected with the core financial system to pose broad systemic risk. But it is likely regulators will continue to face calls for supervised banking institutions to play a role in these markets. Bank regulators will need to weigh competing considerations in assessing bank involvement in crypto activities ranging from custody to issuance to customer facilitation. Bank involvement provides an interface where regulators have strong sightlines and can help ensure strong protections. Similarly, regulators are drawn to approaches that effectively subject the crypto intermediaries that resemble complex bank organizations to bank-like regulation. But bringing risks from crypto into the heart of the financial system without the appropriate guardrails could increase the potential for spillovers and has uncertain implications for the stability of the system. It is important for banks to engage with beneficial innovation and upgrade capabilities in digital finance, but until there is a strong regulatory framework for crypto finance, bank involvement might further entrench a riskier and less compliant ecosystem.  Stablecoins represent a second area with a heightened risk of spillovers. Currently, stablecoins are positioned as the digital native asset that bridges from the crypto financial system to fiat. This role is important because fiat currency is referenced as the unit of account for the crypto financial system. Stablecoins are currently the settlement asset of choice on and across crypto platforms, often serving as collateral for lending and trading activity. As highlighted by large recent outflows from the largest stablecoin, stablecoins pegged to fiat currency are highly vulnerable to runs. For these reasons, it is vital that stablecoins that purport to be redeemable at par in fiat currency on demand are subject to the types of prudential regulation that limit the risk of runs and payment system vulnerabilities that such private monies have exhibited historically. Well-regulated stablecoins might bring additional competition to payments, but they introduce other risks. There is a risk of fragmentation of stablecoin networks into walled gardens. Conversely, there is a risk that a single dominant stablecoin might emerge, given the winner-takes-all dynamics in such activities. Indeed, the market is currently highly concentrated among three dominant stablecoins, and it risks becoming even more concentrated in the future. The top three stablecoins account for almost 90 percent of transactions, and the top two of these account for 80 percent of market capitalization.  Given the foundational role of fiat currency, there may be an advantage for future financial stability to having a digital native form of safe central bank money--a central bank digital currency. A digital native form of safe central bank money could enhance stability by providing the neutral trusted settlement layer in the future crypto financial system. A settlement layer with a digital native central bank money could, for instance, facilitate interoperability among well-regulated stablecoins designed for a variety of use cases and enable private-sector provision of decentralized, customized, and automated financial products. This development would be a natural evolution of the complementarity between the public and private sectors in payments, ensuring strong public trust in the one-for-one redeemability of commercial bank money and stablecoins for safe central bank money. Crypto and fintech have introduced competition and put the focus on how innovation can help increase inclusion and address other vexing problems in finance today. Slow and costly payments particularly affect lower-income households with precarious cash flows who rely on remittances or miss bills waiting on paychecks. Many hard-working individuals cannot obtain credit to start businesses or to respond to an emergency.  But while innovation and competition can reduce costs in finance, some costs are necessary to keep the system safe. Intermediaries earn revenues in exchange for safely providing important services. Someone must bear the costs of evaluating risk, maintaining resources to support those risks through good times and bad, complying with laws that prevent crime and terrorism, and serving less sophisticated customers fairly and without exploitation. In the current crypto ecosystem, often no one is bearing these costs. So when a service appears cheaper or more efficient, it is important to understand whether this benefit is due to genuine innovation or regulatory noncompliance. So as these activities evolve, it is worth considering whether there are new ways to achieve regulatory objectives in the context of new technology. Distributed ledgers, smart contracts, and digital identities may allow new forms of risk management that shift the distribution of costs. Perhaps in a more decentralized financial system, new approaches can be designed to make protocol developers and transaction validators accountable for ensuring financial products are safe and compliant. Innovation has the potential to make financial services faster, cheaper, and more inclusive and to do so in ways that are native to the digital ecosystem. Enabling responsible innovation to flourish will require that the regulatory perimeter encompass the crypto financial system according to the principle of like risk, like regulatory outcome, and that novel risks associated with the new technologies be appropriately addressed. It is important that the foundations for sound regulation of the crypto  financial system be established now before the crypto ecosystem becomes so large or interconnected that it might pose risks to the stability of the broader financial system.","['crypto', 'securities', 'finance', 'financial', 'fintech']","['finance crypto', 'crypto finance', 'risks crypto', 'crypto financial', 'future crypto']","['vulnerabilities crypto financial', 'evolving crypto financial', 'future crypto financial', 'risks evolving crypto', 'crypto finance new']","['future crypto financial system', 'crypto finance', 'crypto financial system', 'current crypto ecosystem', 'crypto markets']"
6119,r220708a_BOE,united kingdom,2022-07-08,Solvency II: Striking the balance,woods,0,"The UK's post-Brexit review of insurance regulation is entering a critical phase, with important decisions shortly to come for us, government and Parliament. With that in mind I thought it would be useful to highlight some of the key points from the Prudential Regulation Authority's (PRA's) perspective, while HM Treasury's current consultation on Solvency II is ongoing, with a particular focus on the main point of contention between us and parts of the industry. My main message is this. Following Brexit we have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to re-shape insurance regulation to work better for the UK. We can do this while loosening parts of the regime which were over-calibrated by the EU and making it easier for insurers to invest in a wider range of assets, but we also need to strengthen it in one area in order to avoid risks to the millions of current and future pensioners who rely on insurers for their retirement income. The combined effect of these changes should support the government's objectives for competitiveness, growth and investment in the economy. Following our exit from the EU, we have been examining the main bit of prudential insurance regulation (Solvency II) to see how it can be tailored to work better for the UK, working with the Treasury. The Treasury has set three objectives for the review, which we support: a competitive insurance sector, investment to support growth and policyholder protection. While the details of the review can appear technical and abstract, the stakes are real. A stable insurance sector backstops the livelihoods of millions of policyholders, in particular current and future pensioners who rely on insurers for their retirement incomes. The insurance sector is also a major part of the wider financial sector, and an important source of finance for the real economy including productive and green investment. Brexit gives us an opportunity to rewrite the insurance regulations we inherited from the EU - and in doing so help drive further investment in the economy. But we need to be clear that this is not a free lunch. If changes simply loosen regulations which were over-cooked by the EU, without tackling other areas where regulations are too weak, then we are putting policyholders at risk. The interests of pensioners and other insurance policyholders can get lost in these debates, but Parliament has given the PRA a primary objective to protect policyholders, and it is a central part of our job to highlight risks and propose ways to deal with them. While pursuing our primary objectives of safety and soundness and policyholder protection, we also have regard to a number of important considerations, including the competitiveness of the sector and the contribution it can make to long-term economic growth. We are also mindful that as part of its review of the Future Regulatory Framework, the Government has proposed to give the PRA a new secondary objective to promote long-term economic growth and international competitiveness, alongside our existing secondary competition objective. With all of those factors in mind, we think we can deal with the risks we are worried about while also supporting the government's wider objectives. Specifically, some in the insurance industry have the impression that we are opposed to any release of capital requirements for insurers. I want to be very clear that that is not the PRA's position - indeed, following a lot of work and examination of the evidence over the last year or so we think that a substantial capital release should be possible while continuing to protect policyholders adequately. This could occur as part of a reform package comprising three main components: While there are important issues to debate on the first two elements, it's on the third of these that there is the main current difference of view between the PRA and parts of the life insurance sector and I will focus mainly on that element in my remarks today. The main point of contention in the review is what, if anything, to change about the calibration of a part of the regime called the ""Matching Adjustment"" (or ""MA"" for short). It's usually at this point in any speech about insurance regulation that most people switch off, but bear with me while I try to bring the issue to life. First, what is this ""MA"" and what does it do? It allows insurance companies to recognise as capital up-front a part of the income they expect to earn on their assets in the future, but only as long as they can show that the cashflows they expect to receive from those assets closely match the payments they have undertaken to make to their insurance policyholders (hence ""matching"" adjustment). This is therefore most relevant for the annuity business, where insurance companies promise to pay individuals' pensions far into the future. You might ask why the regulator favours such an arrangement, which is not common in other bits of regulation, when perhaps it would be more prudent to make insurance companies wait until those returns (for instance, interest payments on corporate bonds) are actually paid to them before recognising them as capital which could be paid out to shareholders. The reason is that we think it protects policyholders if insurance companies are incentivised to invest in assets which will produce cash at the right time, so that insurance companies are not scrabbling around for the right assets when they have to make payments to pensioners in the future. However, you would be right to think that if we allow such an arrangement we must operate it with a very high degree of confidence that those future returns will in fact materialise - in other words that insurance companies do not recognise up-front returns which then later don't show up. Second, why does the MA matter? For me there are two reasons. First, the nature of the business for which it is primarily used: pensions provided by insurance companies. When an individual puts their life savings into an insurance company in return for a promise that the company will pay their pension right up until their death (potentially decades later), we need to be very confident that the company is going to be able to make good on that promise. The same is true when companies of all sorts pass their pension liabilities over to an insurance company, which is happening in very high volumes - for those pensioners too we need take care that the foundations of that insurer are robust. We estimate that over 8 million policyholders are served by this sector. And second, the MA is a vital part of those foundations simply because it is so large - on the most recent figures, the total assets in MA portfolios amount to around PS380 billion, and the MA confers a capital benefit on insurers of around PS80 billion - up from around PS60 billion when the regime was introduced. To put that PS80 billion figure in context, the entire capital base of the life insurance industry is around PS112 billion, and for a number of insurers the MA by itself makes up the bulk of their capital. In short, millions of pensioners rely on their insurer for their livelihood, and in turn those insurers rely very heavily on the MA. It is true that people who get their pension from an insurance company which fails should have some protection from a compensation scheme which spreads the cost of failures across the industry, but we should not underestimate the risks to them, the industry and the public purse of a major failure - we need to be sure that the basis on which pension promises are made is solid. Given its size and the very important role in plays in our economy, it might surprise some listeners to learn that the MA is a relatively recent invention. It only came into force in the UK as part of the EU's implementation of Solvency II a little over six years ago. Before that we had for many years allowed insurance companies to take some capital benefit from future returns - the MA took the basic idea of this older regime, and through the process of EU negotiations turned it into a new form. In many ways the EU's MA has done its job well over those six years, but our experience of seeing it in action has made us worry about three things: : the past may not be a good guide to the future. I explained that the MA allows insurance companies to recognise as capital up-front part of the income they expect to earn on their assets in the future. The word ""expect"" is doing more work in this sentence than you might have appreciated. In working out what returns firms should expect to receive from their assets, it is necessary to make assumptions about how many of those assets will go bad - for instance, how likely is it that a company in whose bonds an insurer has invested will go bust and stop paying interest? Or how likely is it that an insurer will get into trouble, be forced to sell its asset for less than it originally paid and recognise a loss? Due to these possibilities it would obviously be wrong to recognise all the returns on assets up-front, because some of them will not materialise - at the very least these need to be deducted. Under the MA this is done in a mechanical way, based on returns and losses experienced in the past. The problem with this approach is simply that expected losses based on averaging the past may or may not be a good guide to the future. There are plenty of examples in finance and elsewhere where the past has not proved a good guide to the future - recent moves in some commodity markets is a topical example, and the performance of subprime US mortgages in the financial crisis is another which illustrates the serious costs that can be incurred when we get this wrong. Given that the livelihoods of millions of pensioners depend on getting this right, we think we need to recognise this uncertainty - by deducting a bit more from what can be counted as capital up-front to allow for it. I should be clear that this isn't just the view of a prudential regulator - any sensible financial market participant will demand some buffer of safety (or 'credit risk premium') when potential losses are uncertain, and it is odd that the EU's MA construct does not explicitly address this. : wrong asset, wrong risk. Under the rules we have inherited from the EU, the amount of future losses firms are required to expect on their assets is based on the historical performance of corporate and government bonds. At the time the rules were negotiated these assets accounted for the very large bulk of insurers' investments, so this made sense - but as insurers invest more in other sorts of assets, there is an obvious risk that those assets' future performance will diverge from the benchmarks used in the rules. For example, it is reasonable to question whether the losses which might arise from investments in a commercial real estate loan today will be the same as those experienced on corporate bonds in the past - even if they have the same credit rating. It is notable that the market requires very different levels of return for assets with the same rating - under the current rules all of this difference is deemed to be risk-free and can be recognised as capital up-front, but it is quite plausible that some of it reflects other risks such as operational ones. the assumption that market moves tell us nothing about credit risk. Under the current system, when the market sells off assets there is approximately zero impact on insurers because the sell-off is treated as being driven solely by liquidity concerns. In other words, when the prices of assets drop in the market the assumption is that there is no information in this about the outlook for future losses. Now in broad terms this is in fact a feature of the regime, not a bug - we want insurers to be able to ride out market shocks, and it is safe for them to do so as long as they have the right cash coming in to meet their commitments to pensioners and other policyholders. However, the current construct is at the most generous possible extreme of the assumptions that can be made in this area; contrary to this assumption, it may sometimes be the case that asset prices are falling because new information has arrived in the market that does indicate that future losses are going to be higher than previously expected - or at the very least that uncertainty over future losses has increased. There is a case that we should take some notice of this in the way the regime operates, rather than just ignore it. In summary, our experience of operating the MA suggests to us that the broad mechanism works but that the EU design makes insufficient allowance for uncertainty, the difference in riskiness between assets, and signals from the market. As a result of this, we are concerned that it over-estimates the portion of future returns which can confidently be assumed to be free of risk for insurance companies and therefore safely banked as capital up-front. Some might suggest that this is fine, because insurance capital requirements are set to cover a 1-in-200 year stress. But that mixes up capital requirements and capital resources. The risk of a weak MA is that capital resources could be over-stated, and strong capital requirements are no defence if the capital being used to meet those requirements is not sufficiently solid. The system as currently set up provides a particularly strong incentive for insurers to hunt out assets which happen to have a high return relative to their credit rating. Here is an intuitive way to think about the risk in this if taken too far, which our team calls the ""high-spread-for-rating assets"" - or more colloquially the ""too-good-to-be-true assets"" - issue. Imagine you have two bonds. Both mature at the same time, both are in sterling and both have the same credit rating. But one of them pays interest of 5% a year, the other one only 2%. Let's also imagine that you can put funds somewhere without any risk and earn interest of 1%, and that the Solvency II rules say that for assets with the credit rating of these bonds we have to allow 0.5% per year to cover the risk of things going wrong. Now under the existing rules, for the bond paying 2% the insurer treats 0.5% as the MA - this is the 2% interest on the bond, less the 1% risk-free rate and the 0.5% allowance for things going wrong. The insurer will bring all of that interest due in the future, so 0.5% for each year, forward to today and count it as shareholders' capital. For the 5% bond, the insurer does exactly the same: although the bond pays so much more interest than the 2% bond, the insurer uses the same risk-free rate (1%) and allowance for things going wrong (0.5%). As a result the insurer books as capital up-front the entirety of the 3.5% (5% less 1.5%), so a much bigger amount than for the 2% bond. Some stakeholders think we shouldn't allow this at all, even for the 2% bond. We don't agree with that position, but we do think we need to ask: are we entirely confident that all of that extra return on the 5% bond can safely be considered risk-free and banked as capital up-front? Now an insurance regulator determined to defend the regime we've inherited from the EU might say: ""yes"". An insurance company executive with a lot of capital being created by this arrangement might say the same. But I think most people, presented with this arrangement and this question, would respond by saying: ""maybe, maybe not"". Perhaps some of that extra 3% that the 5% bond pays, relative to the 2% bond, is a reward for extra risk. Perhaps we should not put 100% faith in the fact that the bonds have the same credit rating, given how spectacularly wrong ratings have sometimes been in the past - and noting that for many assets only an internal rating, performed by the firm owning the asset, is available. Perhaps it's OK that the rules should allow an insurer to bank more up-front from the 5% bond, but we should also make a greater allowance for the possibility that some of that extra return on the 5% bond may be reward for a higher risk of things going wrong. This question might not matter much if this part of our insurance regime didn't provide capital relief equivalent to two thirds of the entire capital base of our life insurance industry, and didn't underpin the livelihoods of millions of pensioners. But as it does both of those things, we don't think ""maybe"" is a good enough answer. The current set-up does also lead to some odd results, such as a group of assets sitting on insurers' balance sheets today for which the capital banked up-front (in the form of MA) was in fact greater than the entire cost of the assets themselves. Further, data provided by firms suggests that over 20% of BBB exposures have an MA benefit that exceeds a reasonable estimate of a 1 in 200 year capital requirement, resulting in firms effectively creating capital by taking on more risk. We need to learn from our experience over the last six years and make changes to get this part of the regime onto a firmer footing. We have also looked at this question top-down, by reviewing the literature on what portion of asset returns may be a ""liquidity premium"" that can be earned without risk by investors who are willing and able to tie up their funds for long periods, which is what insurers can do and what the MA attempts to identify. There is wide disagreement on this amongst academics, but if you plot the MA against the range of views we have seen then you find that the MA is either towards the most generous end of that range or well outside it. This is a topic on which reasonable people can differ, but given the very important role the MA plays it is concerning that the regime is not more consistently well within the range of views offered independently by others. Based on the analysis and evidence we have reviewed, we think we need to take some steps now to guard against these problems with the MA leading to an insurer getting into trouble in the future. As part of the wider package of reforms under consideration, we think those steps should also support the government's investment objectives. This should occur in one or both of two ways. First, our analysis indicates to us that the combined effect of the reforms - in particular loosening the risk margin while tightening the MA - should free up a significant amount of capital for insurance companies across the sector, which they could choose to re-deploy into investment if their boards support that course of action rather than returning it to shareholders. We think that on recent economic conditions - specifically, those at both year-end 2020 and year-end 2021 - the amount of capital released would be equivalent to 10-15% of the current capital held by life insurers, which could support between PS45b and PS90b in additional investment in the economy. In higher interest-rate environments the figure would be a bit lower, simply because the risk margin in its current form shrinks as interest rates go up and therefore the large cut we propose releases less capital when rates are higher. But we think it is still a material release - for instance we estimate it would be 5-7% under one long-run 'rates up' scenario. The non-life sector would also see a material capital release. Some insurers strongly question whether our proposals do in fact loosen the regime overall in this way, and we will need to look at this carefully as the consultation closes. Part of this is about transitional arrangements, which we think we could come to in any discussions about implementation. But another important area of difference appears to be what assumptions should be made about how much longevity risk is re-insured off-shore into other jurisdictions in the future. We have assumed that roughly half of longevity risk is off-shored in this way, consistent with the current stock on the balance sheets of the sector. Some insurers argue that we should assume something much higher, such as 90%. Although this is the current practice for some insurers for new business, in steady state we are not convinced that we should build a regime that bakes in such very high levels of off-shoring across the industry. Baking in such an approach sector-wide could create concentration risks around a few reinsurers and an excessive dependence on other countries' regimes which are not designed with UK policyholders primarily in mind. However, this debate on capital impacts is clearly an important one and we will study carefully the evidence and data which insurers provide in response to the consultation, in order to inform our view. Second, the current structure does not particularly incentivise insurers to invest in the sorts of productive assets the government wishes to encourage. The MA incentivises insurers to seek out assets which have the highest return relative to the regulatory benchmark used to estimate future losses - these may or may not be productive or indeed UK assets. To give just one example, one of the most MA-generative assets our team has come across so far is a 100-year bond issued by a Latin American country, which surely has nothing to do with the government's investment objectives for the UK. It's simply an asset that happens to pay a high return relative to the rating it has managed to secure. Indeed, looking at insurers' assets six years into the regime it is notable that the MA currently tilts incentives towards assets like ground rents - and that infrastructure fares relatively less well (see Chart A). Now to help support the right kind of investment, we propose important changes to speed up approval processes and widen the range of assets in which insurers can invest - I think there is broad support for those changes, and this may prove to be the part of the reform package which does most to promote investment through time. For example, we would like to allow a less constrained approach for assets which are expected to have future stable cashflows but which include some flexibility on the timings of those cashflows, such as investments with an initial construction phase. We think this will encourage industry to invest at an earlier stage in infrastructure projects. But it is equally important that we take steps to dampen the incentives the regime currently creates simply to seek out those assets which have a high return relative to the expected losses set out in the rules. This is particularly important because the competitive nature of the market for moving corporate pension schemes over to insurers means that even if firms have the best intentions to invest in productive UK assets, they will still be compelled to invest in the most MA-producing assets they can find or risk losing the business to other competitors. In order to make progress on these issues we have published a full Discussion Paper and Technical Annex, alongside the Treasury's wider consultation paper, in which we set out the evidence as we see it and propose one way forward. The data collection exercise we ran with the industry earlier in the review indicated to us that the different structures for the MA included in that exercise should not be pursued because their impact could be too large and in particular they would make insurers' balance sheets too volatile. The industry made these points very strongly, and provided data which supported their case. Hence our team went back to the drawing board and has brought forward revised proposals, which on our assessment are around 70% less volatile than the structures included in the earlier data collection exercise. So far the industry reaction to these revised proposals has been strongly negative. We're listening to the reasons for that reaction, will continue to engage and look forward to responses to the consultation, in order to make sure we fully understand the concerns being raised. It is important that whatever decisions are taken on this topic are taken based on the latest data and I would urge insurers to participate constructively in our evidence gathering. We understand the pressures on firms and are being as flexible as possible to enable firms to respond to our request. More broadly, we would welcome any ideas and suggestions for how the issues we have identified can be tackled. We have laid out one model, but it may well be the case that this could be improved upon or that there are other ways of achieving our objectives. We think it's essential that we tackle the problems we have identified with the current regime, but we have an open mind as to how this is done as long as it is done credibly. I am also hearing some insurers say that they would prefer simply to stick with the EU's version of Solvency II as it evolves. To be honest I think this is a red herring. The government has been clear that the point of leaving the EU, at least insofar as financial regulation goes, is to enable us to tailor our regime to make it work better for the UK. The main area of contention for us in the UK, the MA, is very little used in the EU (other than in Spain, where firms invest in a much more vanilla range of assets) and the EU therefore has no need to consider changes of the sort we need to look at. Conversely, the EU has had to tighten up its regime strongly in another area, but one which has no impact on the UK whatsoever as it relates to euro-denominated liabilities and not sterling ones. We must avoid a regulatory race-to-the-bottom following Brexit, but if we do want to make comparisons then it is worth noting that the net capital released for EU insurers as a result of the changes proposed by the EU Commission is significantly lower than those proposed in the UK when scaled for market size, although the EU position is not yet settled. In our view our proposed package of reforms to insurance regulation will support all of the government's objectives for the review. But it is essential that we take forward all three elements: a major loosening of one important part of the regime (the Risk Margin); changes to cut bureaucracy, and to enable insurers to invest in a wider range of assets; and changes to put another part of the regime (the Matching Adjustment) onto a more sustainable footing. Industry views at this stage seem broadly to support the first two elements of the package, but not the third. In our view a package which did not tackle the issues we have identified with the Matching Adjustment would be seriously unbalanced. It would simply remove bits of regulation that insurers don't like without taking proper account of risks to policyholders, and would not provide a solid basis for investment. I worry that some might consider such a thing to be a free lunch, but in fact less capital, fewer checks and fewer restrictions on assets, with no steps to strengthen the part of the regime where that is needed, means more risk for pensioners and other policyholders. In our view leaving the EU should not lead us to lower standards of financial regulation in the UK. We should change regulations to work better for the UK, including by stripping away unnecessary bureaucracy we have inherited from the EU and taking steps to support investment, competitiveness and long-term growth. But changing prudential regulations in the UK should not be simply a one-way street, particularly where that would mean weakening protections for business which serves groups such as pensioners. There are areas where the regulation we have inherited from the EU is too strong for UK, and others where it is too weak. We should be willing to make changes in both directions where the evidence supports it. Industry will of course have strong views on any changes - we should attach significant weight to these and be willing to adapt our thinking in light of evidence provided. But regulation is there to serve the British public, and that should guide us as we aim to strike the right balance in this important set of reforms. Like other bits of financial regulation, Solvency II was imported into the UK upon Brexit - parts of it into legislation which is the domain of government and Parliament, and parts of it into the regulator's rulebook. Because of this structure the review is led by HM Treasury on behalf of government but with strong involvement from the PRA. In more technical terms: the MA reduces firms' exposure to interest rate and reinvestment risk. It also allows a buy-and-hold investment strategy which enables a firm to access the liquidity premium which has historically been observed in spreads on fixed interest assets. Estimate based on regulatory data on annuity contracts collected by the PRA. Note that the number of policyholders estimated in this way may not precisely match the number of individuals: there will be cases where one contract covers multiple individuals, or where the same individual has multiple policies. The ABI, which covers most but not all of the sector, estimates 6.1 million annuities from its members. Particularly where credit losses have been mitigated by significant government intervention in the past, which may or may not be available in future crises. The only way in which the EU's FS formulation includes any further allowance beyond expected losses is via an all-purpose floor that is unsatisfactory because it is not explicitly additive, as it should be if it were intending to allow for costs of transfer beyond expected losses. Indeed it does not bite for some rating and duration combinations, meaning that for those the FS is equal to expected losses. In fact, it is used specifically as a catch-all for when there isn't enough default data (e.g. for government bonds). There are more technical reasons why the SCR does not substitute for a robust MA. The SCR only covers stressed outcomes over a 1 year time horizon. For business exposed to long-term risks (such as the future default experience of a buy-and-hold investment portfolio) such a short horizon can only make sense if it is based on stresses applied to transfer values - with those transfer values already reflecting the long-term nature of the risks. So the SCR is not a substitute for proper valuation of liabilities. While this is an illustrative example, it is closely based on actual assets in the regime today. Technically, it's the yield on the bond that is used. Data as at end-2020. This is true in aggregate, though some individual firms will be impacted more or less depending on their business models. This is based on data from the 'rates up' sensitivity tested in the Quantitative Impact Study, available at: Longevity risk is the financial risk insurers face when policyholders live longer than expected. Off-shoring that risk means passing it on to a reinsurance firm outside the UK.

6120,r220711a_BOE,united kingdom,2022-07-11,"It’s the risk management, stupid!",kashyap,0,"Anil Kashyap talks about our work to make sure UK banks and insurers understand the risks they face from climate change. This is one of the ways we are working to keep the UK's financial system stable. He highlights how these firms need to improve the way they report climate risks. And he sets out the questions that management boards need to ask to keep firms on the right track. Firms must address these challenges now. Not doing so will cause serious problems for the financial system in the future, he warns. Thanks for the invitation to speak today. It is something of an understatement to say that central banks have a lot on their plates these days. Globally this has led many prominent observers to question whether central banks are over-reaching in analyzing climate risk? I am going to explain why a proper analysis of climate risk is absolutely essential from a financial stability perspective. To make this tangible I will illustrate my argument by describing some of the findings from the climate change focused Exploratory Exercise, known as the ""CBES"", that the Bank of England has recently completed with the major UK banks and insurers. The results were published in May, and I am going to try explain why I see them as one of the Bank's most important publications of this year - perhaps I can even convince some of you to take a look. I will divide my remarks up into three parts. I will begin with a brief overview of what we did in this exercise. Then I will describe some of the findings that I see as being most interesting and, in a few cases troubling. I will conclude by posing some open questions that I think senior management at firms ought to be asking. My bottom line is that financial services firms and their customers have a long way to go if we are going to overcome some of the problems surfaced by the CBES. Unless we make significant progress in the near term, we will encounter serious problems for the financial system in the long-term. There have already been a number of speeches by colleagues at the Bank who have gone through the structure of the exercise and many of its quantitative findings. So I am going to focus more on qualitative lessons. To get there though I need to tell you a bit about how this project was set up. The basic idea was to present major banks and insurers with a fully worked out description of how the economy might evolve with respect to various climate scenarios. A first response to the over-reach critique is to recognize that the industry could not do this on its own, involvement of the regulators was essential. Finalising plausible scenarios required a dedicated team in the Bank, building on the extensive work from the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) , working for over a year and it involved 1000s of hours of work. This included consulting climate scientists, talking to the financial institutions themselves, and drawing on expertise from economists and other Bank staff. Importantly they had to make sure that the various assumptions were internally consistent. Having a regulator do this rather than an industry committee was undoubtedly a more rigorous and efficient way to proceed. Furthermore, because much of the interest is in seeing the aggregate results, making sure that all the major players participated was essential. Of course, we can walk and chew gum, so this work relied on different staff than the ones who support the monetary policy committee and therefore this exercise did not hinder the MPC. Ultimately, we probed three scenarios. Two had to do with different assumed paths for how the price of carbon changed in order to hit the UK government's stated objective of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 (the price for carbon is a good stand in for overall circumstances in these scenarios). One transition path assumed that carbon prices began rising right away and moved smoothly to hit the required level - we called this the early action (EA) path. The other assumed that policy action was delayed and then had to be abruptly changed to quickly raise prices to meet the objective (the late action, LA path). The delayed scenario causes more disruption to the economy because the rapid shift in policy makes it more difficult for people and businesses to adjust, but under each of these scenarios the objective is obtained. So the economy reaches a new equilibrium with a sustainable climate by the end of the scenarios. Figure 1 shows the assumed price of carbon in the two scenarios. The third scenario was very different. It supposed no new climate policies are introduced beyond those already implemented - the no additional action, NAA, path. This leads to devastating consequences for the environment and importantly means that the planet is not in equilibrium by the end of the scenario, with physical risks continuing to increase. So the longer you look out, the more grim the consequences will be (and there are other issues that arise in this scenario such as people losing their houses that are not present in the other scenarios). So if you do decide to look at any of the numbers in the report, keep that in mind, it is not really an apples to apples comparison between the first two scenarios and the third one. To give some sense of the stakes, the average temperature change in the scenarios that involve a policy response and no additional action scenario are shown in Figure 2. I trust you all realize that climate scientists are agreed that a 3 degree increase in temperatures would be devastating, and that in the NAA scenario temperatures would still climb further even after the scenario ends. The participants all delivered their estimates of what they believed would happen to their loan portfolio and insurance businesses under these scenarios. The Bank staff engaged in dialogue with participants through the design process and after launch to promote consistency of interpretation around the rules of the exercise, and to refine methodology. These conversations were valuable for both sides. The final and quite novel step in the exercise was to ask participants to update their assumptions, based on what we learned when we analysed participants' initial proposed responses and projections. The participants were also invited to adjust their submissions to account for aggregate patterns that had been uncovered. Here an example might be the best way to explain why this is important. A firm might suppose that there would be many exciting investment opportunities that would arise during the transition period and presume it could rotate its portfolio to undertake these investments, while pulling back from business models that might be becoming obsolete. If everyone reasons this way, the supply of funding available for the new opportunities could easily exceed the demand for funds. So this kind of rotation may be more difficult to accomplish than would be foreseen. A second response to the over-reach critique is how could a responsible financial stability regulator not want to know this information? With the scene now set, let me turn to some of the main things that we learned. To be clear, given time constraints, I am obviously cherry-picking and you really ought to review the speeches I cited by my colleagues to see the conclusions that others have drawn. Here, I will focus on four areas. First, it is apparent that modelling climate risk will require financial services firms to look at their customers differently than they do now. For many customers, business as usual will become impossible to sustain. This could occur for several reasons. It is possible that the product being sold is itself inconsistent with a world that features much higher carbon prices. In other words, a direct effect of the transition to the greener economy could render the product unviable. However, there could also be an indirect reason why the product could become obsolete. A firm could be an input supplier to a business which is directly affected and so even though the input itself can be produced without any required changes, the demand for the input could disappear. Lenders do not normally need to know every detail about the entire production chain of their borrowers. They also do not necessarily collect information on the carbon content of the products being sold by the borrowers. Insurers also do not currently need to know this information, but will in the future to assess whether the securities that they will invest in will retain their value. So financial services firms will need a lot of non-standard information and reporting requirements will need to change to make this information available. Again the customers will have to cooperate on this because in some cases the data are not collected by anyone. This leads me to what is probably the most striking finding for me that comes out of this exercise is the degree to which missing data hampered responses. Every single respondent had some examples in their submissions for which they could not fully respond because they did not have the information that they needed available. Here are some of the examples of things the participants said they wished they knew but did not. Another response to the over-reach critique is how we would verify these kinds of data gaps are present and decide which are most acute if we had not done this exercise? A second, closely related observation is that the modelling was typically uneven inside each firm. Firms differed greatly in the degree of granularity that they used in their modelling. At a high-level, some firms think about top down approaches that suppose all firms in a sector are identical so that a single loss assumption for the sector is the essential driver of the results. Others use a very detailed bottom up approach that took borrower specific conditions into account. Particularly for the energy sector there was varying degrees of sophistication shown in thinking through the consequences of the various scenarios. Given that we are in the early stages of modelling climate risk, it is not surprising that firms differ in the degrees of sophistication that they exhibit in modelling. What was surprising to me was that even within a given firm there tended to be a lot of variation in the how different parts of the organization modelled things. Here are some examples. The uneven responses within the same organization yields an important implication for management: there are limits on how much having the right tone at the top buys in terms of managing climate risk. My takeaway from the CBES is all the major firms have more work that needs to get done. Third, there was also another important modelling consideration that proved important. All firms relied, to differing degrees, on third party consultants to assist in some aspects of the modelling. Again given that this is a new topic the fact that there is not complete expertise in house is to be expected. It will take time for the financial services firms to hire the new staff that is needed and build up competence. In a few cases, even the consultant's models were not flexible enough to fully follow the instructions about what was to be assumed in a given scenario. For instance, one model that was used was overly reliant on a simple treatment of emissions to capture the impact of transition policies. Users of this model would feed in estimates of emissions and then a carbon price would be applied to the emissions to arrive at cost numbers. This meant that for some sectors the impact on a corporate's customers was poorly assessed. This was a particular issue for modelling the performance of financial firms for whom the success of their business model is intimately linked with the performance of their clients. More complex sector specific models also made simplifying assumptions that were not always consistent with the scenarios provided. For example, we tried to ask participants to factor in how changing demand for their products/services would impact their customers. We also specified some guidelines about how much adaptation could be plausibly assumed. Some participants instead just assumed that market shares of customers would remain constant -- this implicitly assumes the customers are able to respond to the scenario in a way that was not modelled and could not be assessed. I expected that the modelling challenges would be large. I also expect that improvements will be incremental. The value in the CBES is showing many tangible places where progress is needed so that both supervisors and firms can benchmark their capabilities. A fourth response to the over-reach critique, is how else would this progress occur if the supervisors were not engaged in an exercise like the CBES? A final issue surfaced when we provided the participants with feedback on the responses that we collected and asked them to reconsider their initial answers. One risk that we noted is that many lenders and insurers plan to dial back business with so-called brown industries and actively are looking to establish ties to green industries. This will need to happen, but the overall health of the economy and financial system requires an orderly rotation. In particular, there are immutable constraints on the speed at which green forms of energy production can be ramped up. There needs to be adequate credit made available to brown firms so they can invest in greening during the transition period and so that the overall energy supply for the economy is adequate. If everyone cuts off the brown producers indiscriminately and too quickly, that could be calamitous for the economy. The distress in the economy would also likely have adverse effects for the banks. Some of the participants realized that their plans might not be feasible or at least much more challenging to stick with than they had initially realized. For instance, a bank might need to rotate its customer mix to achieve its lending goals. Life Insurance firms tended to assume that a simultaneous pullback in asset exposure would be manageable. To the extent divestment was needed the standard assumption is that this could take place via letting bonds mature. Of course, if the debt issuers cannot roll their expiring bonds that will create additional risks, for instance causing impairments on their bonds that have not expired. I hope these examples explain why I think this exercise has been so valuable, both for the participants and for the Bank of England. This is going to be a long road and everyone involved has already learned a lot. In the spirit of trying to advance the agenda, here are some questions that I think I would be asking if I was on the management team of a financial services firm. First, how much extrapolation are you having to do because of missing data? Perhaps more importantly, how will we fill in these gaps? It does not seem from afar that progress on this front is likely absent an active plan for improvement that needs to come from the top. Given the massive uncertainty associated with how this will play out, getting much better data is essential managing risks well. Second, do you know which third parties you're reliant on and what are their key assumptions/features of their models? It is probably efficient for at least the next few years to outsource some of this work. Imagine trying to decide which consultants to pick: it is quite likely that the most highly rated consultants provide models that require better data to be input and perhaps more expert judgment to take maximum advantage of the models. Do you know if your staff has the needed data and expertise to effectively utilize and eventually challenge the consultants? Third, what is my firm best and worst at modelling and how will we level up our capability? The Bank of England is meeting with the participants in the CBES to try to share best practices. It will also share these findings with broader financial firms, who will also find it valuable. Firms though must own the responsibility of implementing the changes and this is going to take time, so starting sooner is better. Fourth, going forward what are the key assumptions your institution is making about the trajectory of climate policy and physical risk and its impact? Are the assumptions associated with your risk management of different credit books internally consistent within your organisation? In some sense, being able to answer these questions is essential for having a fully credible modelling process in place. If the management cannot ask the staff to do scenario analysis that is internally consistent, that is a sign that the modelling capabilities are incomplete. Finally, if other banks and insurers are expecting to carry out the same strategic changes to their businesses that you are, would your planned response to climate risk still be a workable/sensible one? To me this is the most important question for financial stability. We can't expect firms to automatically internalize the effects of their choices on the overall system. That is exactly why doing this kind of exercise to uncover the system-wide response is essential. When Bill Clinton was running for President of the United States in 1992 his campaign advisors famously had a sign in their headquarters to try to make sure they kept the big picture in mind. That sign said ""It's the economy stupid"". I fear that the CBES was so rich with numbers that it is easy to get lost in the details and lose the forest from the trees about what we learned already and what we need to do to move forward. That is why I titled the speech ""It's the risk management stupid"". My big takeaway is that private sector firms have a big risk management problem regarding climate risk in front of them. It is the job of supervisors to assess the size of the problem and work with the industry to address it. To say this is over-reach is folly. Risks to financial stability can arise from many places, whether its climate change, cyber-attacks or the cryptoassets. If the supervisors were ignoring this problem, a decade on critics would be asking how could we have not seen problems coming and failed to act? Thanks for your attention and I will now hand back to Simon for the panel. a series of freely available climate scenarios. The Bank built on these scenarios for the CBES exercise, and other central banks are also drawing on them for their own exercises.

This is a simplification, intended to capture a range of different policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which may include, for example, carbon taxes, cap-and-trade schemes, green subsidies and environmental regulations. Climate scientists' projections conditioned on no further policy action suggest that temperature increases as significant as the exercise would only be likely to occur later in the century.

6122,r220712b_BOE,united kingdom,2022-07-12,Some lessons from the Crypto Winter,cunliffe,0,"March 2022. The FTF currently has 27 members from Board member jurisdictions, and is chaired In accordance with its terms of reference approved by the IOSCO Board on 24 May 2022, the FTF is tasked with developing, overseeing, delivering, and implementing IOSCO's regulatory agenda with respect to Fintech and crypto-assets. It is also charged with coordinating IOSCO's engagement with the FSB and other standard setting bodies on Fintech and crypto-related matters. The FTF has since agreed on its workplan for 2022-2023 which, in its first 12 to 24 months of operation, will prioritize policy-focused work on crypto-asset markets and activities. The FTF will nonetheless continue to monitor and review activities and market developments related to broader Fintech-related trends and innovations. Work on any identified topics of interest would, unless circumstances dictate otherwise, develop to a longer timeframe once the FTF has completed its initial phase of crypto-focused work. This work will be initially divided into two workstreams, the first, covering Crypto and Digital Assets on analysing and responding to market integrity and investor protection concerns within the cryptoasset space. The need to address these concerns is evident from many events affecting the crypto asset space, such as the recent Terra/Luna episode and ensuing market turmoil involving crypto-asset trading, lending and borrowing platforms and other market participants, resulting in significant losses and risks to investors due to inadequate protections and safeguards. In addition, systemic risk concerns will be actively considered, mapping aggregate data to these, where available and appropriate. Our work will be channelled into the FSB's financial stability agenda through close and continuous engagement with relevant workstreams. The key elements and deliverables for each of these workstreams are summarised in the overarching workplan below. While the crypto-asset work agenda is being split between these two internal workstreams, the FTF will nonetheless ensure that they are connected and adopt a coherent and coordinated cross-sectoral approach in developing policy in response to crystallized and emerging risks across the sector. Moreover, IOSCO's responsiveness to market developments and identification of future market trends, as well as the work of the FSB, international standard setting bodies and other international organizations in this area (such as BCBS, FATF and the OECD) is also of critical importance. The FTF will therefore ensure that it engages proactively with each of these constituencies. As the workstreams progress along in their substantive work leading into 2023, the FTF would also explore suitable junctures in 2023 where interim reports could be published to keep markets apprised of the ongoing work of the FTF. The FTF will also seek to actively engage with relevant stakeholders and experts during the policy development phase to help inform our recommendations. This workplan will be reviewed and updated annually and as needed. (CDAWG) will seek input from the FTF and other IOSCO Committees as appropriate. To avoid unnecessary overlap and ensure appropriate coordination on common issues, the CDAWG will also engage with related external working groups. Description of the work The CDAWG will primarily focus on issues relating to market integrity and investor protection. This will entail looking closely at (i) fair, orderly trading, transparent markets, suitability and market implications for financial stability and therefore the intention is to feed the outputs into the FSB CryptoAsset Working Group (CAG). The CDAWG will also coordinate closely with the FTF DeFi WG and other relevant global standard setting bodies. In developing its work, the CDAWG may also consider potential areas in which regulation could play a role in supporting innovation. The work will start with consideration of potential taxonomies of various activities to assist the Task Force as it pursues its work. This will involve an assessment of the emerging risks that may be unique in the crypto-asset markets space and the different legal/regulatory considerations in each jurisdiction. The working group will aim to deliver a public report with proposed policy recommendations in 2023 (Part 3). Report drafting CDA report publication with policy recommendations. To avoid unnecessary overlaps and ensure appropriate coordination on common issues, the DeFi working group will also engage with related external working groups. Description of the work: The DeFi WG's work will build on its previous work, which culminated in the , to further explore the market integrity, investor protection and financial stability risks of DeFi. This work will complement other crypto-asset workstreams, including those relating to DeFi, within Global Standard Setting Bodies (""SSBs"") and the FSB, and the working group will closely coordinate with the Given the opacity, complexity, and shape-shifting nature of DeFi structures, the DeFi WG's objective is to develop a shared understanding among IOSCO members of emerging DeFi trends and risks while providing guidance to IOSCO members on how to manage these risks within their regulatory frameworks. The DeFi WG will also examine how IOSCO principles and standards could apply to also consider potential areas in which regulation could play a role in supporting innovation. The DeFi WG will continue to explore and highlight the links between DeFi, stablecoins, and crypto-asset trading, lending and borrowing platforms, as well as the interactions of DeFi with broader financial markets Report drafting DeFi report publication with policy recommendations.","['crypto', 'fintech', 'cryptoasset', 'ftf', 'iosco']","['fintech crypto', 'ftf iosco', 'work crypto', 'crypto asset', 'crypto focused']","['fintech crypto assets', 'fintech crypto related', 'bodies fintech crypto', 'respect fintech crypto', 'crypto focused work']","['crypto asset space', 'fsb cryptoasset working group', 'crypto', 'fintech', 'broader fintech']"

Many of those the short and medium term. Others, however, are manifestations of much longer longer-term trends and their effects on the broader landscape in which monetary The world has undergone substantial structural change over recent decades. One such example is population ageing: in the United Kingdom, the life expectancy of a 65 year old woman in 1950 was around 80 years old. By 2015 the equivalent life expectancy was close to 86. Moreover, this 6-year increase in life expectancy was are 7, 8 and 10 years, respectively. Another example is technological change: firms are increasingly moving away from using physical capital, like machinery, equipment and computer hardware, towards intangible capital, like R&D, software and branding. Intangible capital made up 65% of UK firms' investment in the mid-1990s, and this is now 75%, an increase of 10 percentage points. We see similar increases in the This widespread structural change has profound effects on the economy, and the broader landscape that policymakers navigate. Of particular relevance to monetary For example, one of the most striking global trends is the well-documented secular the long-run global trend equilibrium interest rate. This is the long-run trend around which the domestic equilibrium interest rate of an open economy, like the United In this paper, we first explore the effect of structural changes, such as demographic trends and technological change, on Global . To do so, we employ a structural model of the world economy, in which we purposefully abstract from shorter-term that we consider, we find that the decline in Global has primarily been driven by the slowdown in productivity growth and population ageing. The effects of these The long-run decline in the risk-free interest rate is only part of the story, however. A recent literature has emerged showing that the rate of return on capital has not been declining alongside the risk-free rate. In standard economic theory, the wedge between these two rates of return is a key determinant of firms' investment, itself an important factor for the policy landscape, which, over the long run, has implications for productivity and output. In particular, we would expect the observed rise in this wedge to be coupled with a rise in investment. However, no such investment boom the return on capital and the risk-free rate, as the ""missing-investment puzzle"". To for this puzzle, using industry-level data for the United Kingdom. Our results suggest in both investment and the measure of the return on capital, the missing-investment analysis to understand the potential impact of intangibles on long-run productivity. While intangibles can explain the UK missing-investment puzzle, they may have Our results have important implications for the long-run policy landscape. First, our led to permanently lower Global . This means that, without significant reversals in a different direction, Global is expected to remain low. Second, intangible capital appears to account for a significant part of ""missing"" investment in recent years, suggesting that there has not been a structural missing-investment puzzle in the United Kingdom. However, we should be cautious about the impact of the intangible to have contributed to the recent productivity puzzle. It is important to understand why this may be, and the underlying challenges raised by an intangible-intensive The rest of this paper is organised as follows. Section shows our analysis of the discusses the missing-investment puzzle, and the role of intangibles. Section real interest rates at different horizons. We then set out the underlying framework for long-run interest-rate determination, laying out the key factors that can drive the dynamics of the trend real rate. We summarise the results of ), hereafter referred to as CHS, who use a general equilibrium life-cycle model to quantify the impact of each of the drivers. Finally, we discuss how these results The 'equilibrium' or 'neutral' real interest rate is usually defined as the real interest rate required to close the output gap and sustain the inflation rate at its target. In The equilibrium interest rate cannot be directly observed, and must be estimated. Such estimates are typically highly uncertain and so are not used as a mechanical which can change in response to long-run structural forces. Importantly, for an open are weaker over the long run. This implies that it is the global trend real interest rate, , that acts as a long-term anchor for the UK's domestic equilibrium real The above framework suggests that Global can be measured as a common trend shows such an estimate from CHS, obtained by applying the methodology of Del Negro et al. ) to a panel of 31 high-income countries from 1900-2015. is estimated to have been relatively stable at and 1980, reaching a peak of close to 2.5% in the late 1970s. Thereafter, Global declined steadily and is estimated to have been close to 0% in recent years. Though there are relatively wide error bands around this central estimate, and the alternative However, these reduced-form empirical estimates do not tell us why has declined. Understanding the relative importance of the different secular factors that now lay out the key factors that determine the real interest rates in a neo-classical As laid out above, the trend real rate, , is the long-run equilibrium real interest rate. As such, it corresponds to the real interest within a long-run model: a model that In the neo-classical framework, the real interest rate, , is the price that ensures equilibrium in the capital market. Figure provides a graphical representation of this, Firms require capital to produce, and corresponds to the rate at which firms can borrow to finance investment. The marginal cost of each unit of capital, marginal product of capital equal to this marginal cost. If the cost of borrowing falls below the return on capital, firms will be incentivised to borrow in order to invest in capital. The rise in borrowing will raise borrowing rates, and the rise in investment This optimisation, along with the diminishing marginal returns to capital, implies that a higher value of will induce the firm to choose a lower capital-output ratio. This Capital also provides a way for households to accumulate and store wealth to smooth consumption and maximise their utility. is the return that the bonds and productive capital. As long as the return that the household receives on each of these is the same, households will be indifferent about which they hold, and their optimal behaviour will determine their total wealth, rather than how it is allocated. Assuming that the quantity of government debt is determined by the holdings of capital is determined by the fact that aggregate wealth must be equal to separate into two groups. The first group consists of the parameters of the model, which do not change over time. The second group is the structural factors that may In particular, CHS consider five key drivers: productivity growth, population growth and longevity (which together capture population ageing), government debt, and the each driver affects can be seen through their effects on the position of the two of a given capital-output ratio to fall, shifting the orange line to the left. All else equal, A change in the population age distribution towards older generations, due to either a decline in population growth rates or an increase in longevity, raises aggregate household wealth. This is driven by two effects. First, households expecting to live longer will optimally want to accumulate more wealth to finance consumption during a longer retirement. Second, since, in the data, older households are, on average, wealthier than younger households, a rise in the share of older households in the population also increases aggregate wealth. This shifts For a given level of aggregate wealth, a rise in the quantity of household wealth must equal government bonds plus capital, so that the quantity of capital held by households is found by subtracting the quantity of government debt from aggregate wealth. Therefore, if a larger portion of wealth is allocated to government debt, households' holdings of capital declines for all values of . This shifts the blue line to the left. All else equal, this raises and pushes down on the The effect of a change in the relative price of capital on the firm's optimal capital-output choice will depend on the elasticity of substitution between capital and labour. Empirical estimates point to complementarities between the factors of production, so that a decline in the relative price of capital will lead to a decline in the optimal capital-output ratio. This shifts the orange line to the left. All While the qualitative effects of the key drivers of equilibrium interest rates can be understood from the simplified framework considered above, a richer structure is to provide a structural interpretation of the evolution of Global in response to this CHS consider a model of the world as a single large (closed) economy, populated by overlapping generations of finitely-lived households. The model is calibrated so that each time period corresponds to five years, and therefore Consistent with the five-year timing assumption, the model includes fourteen cohorts Using data for a panel of 31 high-income countries from 1950 to 2015, they derive are then fed through the model as exogenous processes driving the dynamics of the equilibrium. The model is simulated using a novel recursive approach that captures slow-moving beliefs about long-term trends, which is particularly relevant as the The results of these simulations depend on the estimated path of these drivers, as well as the parameters that determine the shape, slopes and positions of the lines in . To capture this uncertainty, CHS carry out sensitivity analysis, considering alternative estimates of the path of the drivers, and alternative values of the key parameters. The simulations are repeated under random combinations of these shows the resulting changes in Global , between model simulation, and the median empirical estimate. In the model, this ranges from 1.1 to 3.3 percentage points across the alternative simulations in the sensitivity tests, which encompasses the 95% confidence interval around the empirical estimate. Hence there is a robust finding of a decline in Global over this period, despite the The structural model also allows us to decompose this decline in Global into the contribution of each of the five drivers described The individual contributions of these drivers is shown in the lower panel of Table . We see that productivity growth contributed around half of the decline in Global in the baseline, and robustly leads to a significant decline across the alternative Amongst the two demographics factors, population growth has a small contribution of 0.1 percentage points in the baseline simulations over this time period, though the sensitivity results suggest that the effect could be as large as 0.5 percentage points. Conversely, the key demographic factor is the rise in longevity. This has a large contribution to the decline in Global both in the baseline and across the While the estimates of the path of the underlying drivers end in 2015, the simulations continue past this date until the model has settled at a new We have shown that population ageing played an important role in the decline in Global over recent decades, and this impact is expected to persist going forward. Importantly, the model does not predict that the retirement of the 'baby-boom generation', which roughly begins in 2015, will lead to This is in contrast to the points raised in Lisack et al. ) use a modelling strategy similar to CHS, focusing on the impact of population ageing, and explore in more detail why the conclusions are different. Here we review First, we include not only changes in population growth, which account for the baby boom, but also increasing longevity. As we showed, longevity is a much larger driver of population ageing, and therefore Global . Unlike the baby boom, which is a transitory shock to population growth rates that fades out as those cohorts exit the Second, one of the key factors behind this result is the empirical finding that retirees continue to hold high levels of wealth. While retirees do dissave, this behaviour is not strong enough to materially lower their stock of wealth, which we have seen is what matters for determining the interest rate. Put differently, while the mechanism The modelling framework in CHS brings together five important structural drivers of Global , and decomposes their relative that are not captured by these simulations. CHS discuss these at greater length, Nonetheless, one important missing driver bears more discussion: inequality. A rise savings caused by higher individual income risk ( , ); or changes in the composition of the population towards high-income households, who have the highest savings rates. Mian et al. ) show that this latter channel has significantly increased aggregate wealth in the United States in recent decades, consistent with the decline in . Taking these channels into account is likely to In contrast to our finding on the importance of demographics, Mian et al. wealth in the United States, relative to rising inequality. They reach this conclusion by comparing the variation in the savings rates and the evolution of income shares, across different income quantiles and across different age groups, showing that the variation across age groups is too small to account for the large observed trend in aggregate wealth. They focus their analysis of demographics on 45-64 year olds, this is that they abstract from longevity and the high wealth levels of retirees, thereby in particular. In this sense, their finding of a small contribution from this demographic in risk-free interest rates. However, this is only part of the story. In this section, we show that risk-free rates do not appear to have comoved with the return on capital. We then explore what this means for investment, through the lens of a ""missing As laid out in Section , in a neo-classical framework, firms' optimisation equalises and therefore equal to the return on capital in equilibrium. The quantitative model of CHS, used in Section , does allow for a wedge between the two, capturing the costs of financial intermediation, but assumes that it is fixed over time. Therefore, in However, in recent decades, risk-free rates and the return on capital do not appear to comove in the data. plots the return on capital and risk-free rates for a group of high-income countries since the 1970s. Following the literature, we define (a) shows that this measured rate of return on capital for the market sector has remained stable over recent decades, with a drop around the time of the global financial crisis, much of which has now recovered. Over the same period, across the on 10-year government bonds, shown in Figure (b), rose until the 1980s, and has The change in the wedge between these two rates of return is plotted in Figure , relative to 1971. We can see that it has a U-shaped pattern: the wedge declines from the 1970s until the 1980s, and then rises materially from the 1990s. Even for the United Kingdom, which has shown a smaller rise in the wedge compared to the average, shown in the orange line, the wedge has risen by roughly 7 percentage measure of the wedge in the structural model is stable over time, as shown in the To understand the importance of this wedge, we relate it to one of the key variables In standard economic theory, the wedge shown in Figure is a measure of firm profitability. As such, this wedge is a key determinant of firms' investment: when More precisely, this interpretation assumes that firms can borrow at the risk-free rate, could, however, be that funding costs have not been declining in line with risk-free rates. This would be the case if, for example, lenders are risk averse and risk or risk premium over the risk-free rate, to compensate investors for holding risky claims on firms, so that the funding cost that firms face diverges from the risk-free rate over , we compare the risk-free rate to an alternative measure of funding costs, available for the United Kingdom for part of our sample period, and find that they exhibit very similar dynamics. This suggests that the dynamics of the wedge, between 1970 to the 1980s, and has since climbed up. However, as shown in Figure , investment across the same sample of high-income countries has consistently Bringing this together, therefore, we see that in the early part of the sample, both investment and the wedge were declining, as we would expect from standard theory. Since the 1990s, however, while the wedge has risen, investment has not. In other words this highlights a ""missing-investment puzzle"": not simply that investment has sector. This is shown in the orange line in Figure . As with the investment-to-GDP Regressing this variable on the measure of profitability shown in Figure , we detect the fitted value from the regression estimated from 1970 to 2001. This shows what we would expect investment rates to be had the relationship with profitability been the fundamentals, captured by the measure of profitability. Since the early 2000s, from the regression, thereby illustrating the missing-investment puzzle for the United To investigate the candidate explanations of the missing-investment puzzle, we build the observed decline in US investment in two ways: factors that lower investment by driving down firm profitability, such as expected growth, and factors that lower investment despite high measured profitability. They find a significant role for factors that fall into the latter category, precisely in line with our missing-investment puzzle. We can split the candidate explanations for the missing-investment puzzle into four measures of both investment and profitability would be mismeasured. For instance, investment by firms has moved increasingly away from physical capital (such as buildings and machinery) towards intangible capital (such as R&D, software, data or branding). Measuring investment in intangible assets is far more challenging than we are increasingly under-measuring capital over time, which could account for the The measure of the return on capital that we use, which is based on over marginal costs, arising from imperfect competition. An increase in this measure If firms are not willing to take up long-term investment shares. Hence, increasing short-termism in corporate governance could also explain Imperfect information or moral hazard between lenders and borrowers (eg, between firms and banks or banks and depositors) leads to the emergence of an externalfinance premium, ie a wedge between the risk-free rate and the cost of borrowing of firms. While we showed that the increase in profitability was robust to using other direct measures of funding costs, we can also investigate the impact of factors that determine the external-finance premium, such as the degree of reliance on external Which of these factors is most important is an empirical question, and Gutierrez and ) investigate this question using industry-level data for the United States. Many candidate explanations, such as the intangible share of capital and financial frictions, vary greatly across industries, so a solely macro perspective may across countries. For example, ) find an important role for decreased competition in explaining the puzzle in the United States. While there is a consensus on the increase in market power in the United States ( et al. , ; De Loecker et al. , ), the United Kingdom does not seem to have experienced such marked trends ( Aguda et al. , ). This suggests that the drivers We first check to confirm whether the puzzle is present in the industry-level data. of profitability since the early 2000s, indicating a missing-investment puzzle very We then investigate which of the list of candidate explanations can account for this unexplained weakness in investment. To do this, we augment our industry-level regression by including proxies for those candidate factors, and assess whether the To show this, we use the 2022 vintage of the EU KLEMS data. This vintage not only includes the latest improvements in measuring intangible assets from National Accounts, but also capitalises a broader set of intangible assets building on the work It is the first vintage of EU KLEMS that includes 7 intangible assets in addition to the 4 that were already included in National Accounts, and as We repeat the industry-level regressions, replacing both the measure of investment rates on the left-hand side, and the measure of the return on capital used for the wedge on right-hand side, with these data that are adjusted for intangibles. Figure shows the unexplained variation from the baseline industry-level regressions, as in , as well as the new regression adjusted for intangibles. While the missinginvestment puzzle can still be seen, it is significantly smaller before 2008, becomes smaller again from around 2013, and is even insignificant towards the end of the sample. In other words, the puzzle is smaller and almost disappears in recent years, suggesting that the measurement of intangibles can account for an important part of The remaining puzzle is mostly concentrated immediately after the global financial crisis. As such, it is unlikely that it reflects structural changes, but rather the effects of the crisis (eg, on financial frictions, see Gopinath et al. , ). It is worth noting that this result continues to hold even when we include measures of the financial dependence and liquidity). It could be that we need to further explore firm-level data to capture the impact of financial frictions more accurately, or that there are large non-linearities related to the nature of the crisis that the regression framework does not capture. However, this suggests that the remaining puzzle is likely to be more We have shown that, once we account for intangibles, the UK missing-investment productivity growth declined by as much as 1.3 percentage points in the latest ONS data, when comparing pre- and post-crisis averages (2008-2018 vs. 2000-2007). Surprisingly, rather than reducing this puzzle, as it did for investment, intangibles appear to be driving the productivity puzzle. Figure shows that intangible-intensive One potential reason for this finding is that investment in intangibles is harder to such as the fact that these assets are harder to use as collateral. For this reason, it could be that intangible-intensive industries were most affected by the tightening while intangible investment has recovered in recent years, productivity is still low. Could it be that the additional barriers to financing intangibles benefit investment by Another explanation could be related to the impact of the intangible economy on competition. Intangible technologies tend to require large upfront investments, or so-called fixed costs. This gives firms with high-intangible adoption a competitive advantage, and stops new innovative firms from entering the market. Existing firms in the long-run ( , ; Aghion et al. , ). It is difficult, however, to find supporting evidence in UK data. While this mechanism is consistent with the decline in business dynamism and the increase in market power documented in the United recent decades. Could it be that these risks have not yet materialised in the United Within our modelling framework, both the secular decline in productivity growth and increased longevity imply permanently lower Global . This means that, without significant reversal in these structural trends, or the emergence of new long-run weakness in investment despite an increasing wedge between the return on capital and the risk-free interest rate) over the same period, can be largely accounted for by the mismeasurement of intangible capital. Once we control for intangibles, the puzzle. Rather than reducing this puzzle as it did for investment, intangibles may be driving the labour productivity puzzle, making the overall long-run impact on output ambiguous. Future research should shed light on the unique challenges from the Ten facts on declining business dynamism and lessons from endogenous growth theory. and risk premia accounting for secular trends in interest rates, returns on capital, in the EU and US before and since the Great Recession and its contribution to in advanced economies? if so, why? in Investment and Growth in Advanced Jorgenson, D.

We then focus on the investment rates from Figure onwards, defined as investment net of depreciation to the lagged capital stock at Accounts, while the intangible adjusted series include additional assets available in The return on capital is the real internal rate of return ( ) from the standard with the gross operating surplus, the depreciation rate for asset , the factor. We abstract from this due to data limitations for a large sample of countries. We use the risk-free rate in the baseline analysis assuming it is representative of firms' funding costs. For robustness, we use an alternative measure of funding costs using a weighted average cost of debt and equity from the Bank of England (see the sufficient statistic for profitability is Tobin's , defined as the ratio of market value to replacement cost of capital stock. We confront our measure of profitability, based on the wedge between the internal rate of return and the funding costs of the firms, the main result: the return on capital has been flat when the risk-free rate declined property products). However, these measures miss firms' increased spending on some intangible assets such as organisation capital, design, market research, We use the latest EU KLEMS vintage which capitalises 7 of these additional assets accounting for about 60% of total intangible investment and almost 40% of total capital. We compute adjusted measures of investment and profitability using this broader investment data. Interestingly, as we can see in Figure , and differently from the corresponding unadjusted Figure in the main text, once we use these counterparts. As intangible investments has become an ever larger share of total Beyond affecting the (mis)measurement of investment, Moll et al. ) show how more than investment quantities, and lead to a muted increase in investment relative in automation in the UK relative other European countries, suggesting that intangible UK firms. In a similar way that firms' spending on intangibles constitutes a challenge than in the UK and this pattern could translate into a low investment rate in UK data. Unfortunately, we do not have data on UK firms' investment abroad. However, for our regression analysis, we are able to observe the share of foreign sales out of total Decreased competition, due to technology or regulation, has been put forward as one of the most important drivers of the US investment puzzle (see, in a decline in business dynamism more generally in the United States ( Akcigit and literature is yet to achieve consensus when it comes to concentration in firms' sales: for example, Aguda et al. ) show flat concentration, while Koltay et al. find rising concentration. Furthermore, the UK labour share is flat since the early of market shares to low labour share firms as in the United States ( Gutierrez et al. , ).

In contrast with the United States, we do not see a clear increase in payouts or institutional ownership in National Accounts in the UK ( , We detect a structural break in 2001 and thus estimate the model up to that date. As expected the coefficient on the wedge is positive and significant; given that, we show residuals from this econometric model for the whole sample to document and quantify the UK investment puzzle given profitability, as described in the main text. Industry-level regressions We complement our aggregate results looking at a constructed industry-level wedge, and include both industry and year fixed effects, and quantify the puzzle following ) by reporting the To show the importance of intangibles in explaining the puzzle, we run a regression of the investment rate on the wedge, both adjusted for the additional intangibles not included in National Accounts ( and , respectively) -again the We interpret the reduction in the estimated drag from the year fixed effects shown in Finally, we use the regression of on as our baseline, and include it ends up including only observations from 2000 onwards.

895,r220713a_BOC,canada,2022-07-13,Monetary Policy Report Press Conference Opening Statement,macklem,1,"Governor of the Bank of Canada Press conference following the release of the Good morning. I'm pleased to be here with Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Rogers to discuss today's policy announcement and the Bank's Today, we raised the policy interest rate by 100 basis points, or 1%. An increase of this magnitude at one meeting is very unusual. It reflects very unusual economic circumstances: inflation is nearly 8%--a level not seen in nearly 40 years. I want to explain to Canadians why we've made this decision. There were three key considerations. First, inflation is too high, and more people are getting more worried that high inflation is here to stay. We cannot let that happen. Restoring price stability--low, stable and predictable inflation--is paramount. Second, the Canadian economy is overheated. There are shortages of workers and of many goods and services. Demand needs to slow so supply can catch up and price pressures ease. And third, our goal is to get inflation back to its 2% target with a soft landing for the economy. To accomplish that, we are increasing our policy interest rate quickly to prevent high inflation from becoming entrenched. If it does, it will be more painful for the economy--and for Canadians--to get inflation back down. With these important considerations in mind, the Governing Council decided to front-load the path to higher interest rates today. This is our fourth consecutive interest rate increase since March. We know that higher interest rates will add to the difficulties that Canadians are already facing with high inflation. But the strain of higher interest rates in the short term will bring inflation down for the long term. It will get us to the other side of this difficult period and back to normal. Things are not normal right now. After 30 years of low, stable inflation, many Canadians are experiencing the pain of high inflation--and the uncertainty that comes with it--for the first time. Over half of the components in the consumer price index (CPI) basket are rising above 5%. When inflation is this high, it erodes the purchasing power of every Canadian. The drivers of inflation are the same in Canada as in most countries. The war in Ukraine and continued supply chain disruptions have boosted inflation in Canada and around the world. But what started as global inflation driven by higher global energy and goods prices is broadening here at home. Inflation is broadening because the Canadian economy is in excess demand. There aren't enough goods and services to meet the demand we're seeing as people enjoy a fully reopened economy. Employers can't find enough workers and they're increasing wages to attract and retain staff. With households spending robustly, businesses are passing on higher input and labour costs by raising prices. Higher interest rates will help slow demand and allow supply time to catch up. Consumer spending will moderate as the pent-up demand from pandemic restrictions eases and the cost of borrowing increases. Housing market activity is already cooling rapidly from unsustainably high levels during the pandemic. And slower global growth will reduce demand for our exports. Taking all of this into account, we are forecasting annual growth in economic activity will be around 3 1/2 % this year, 1 3/4 % next year and 2 1/2 % in 2024. As global bottlenecks gradually resolve and tighter monetary policy works its way through the economy, inflation will start to come down. While we may see a few more months with CPI inflation around 8%, we expect it to decline later this year, ease to about 3% by the end of next year and return to the 2% target by the end of 2024. This is the soft landing we are projecting. Interest rate increases can cool demand and inflation without choking off growth or causing a surge in unemployment. Some sectors will be more affected by interest rate increases than others, but the very tight labour market means there is room to reduce the number of job vacancies without having a big impact on overall employment. And with the prices of many of the commodities we export expected to remain elevated, the global forces slowing growth will not affect Canada as much as many other countries. But the path to this soft landing has narrowed because elevated inflation is proving more persistent. And this requires stronger action now so consumers and businesses can be confident that inflation will return to its 2% target. Our decision today takes the policy interest rate to 2 1/2 %. That puts it in the longrun neutral range that neither stimulates nor restricts growth. We estimate that range to be between 2% and 3%. We continue to expect that interest rates will need to rise further to cool demand and achieve the inflation target. How high our policy rate needs to go will depend on how the economy and inflation evolves. By front-loading interest rate increases now, we are trying to avoid the need for even higher interest rates down the road. Front-loaded tightening cycles tend to be followed by softer landings. This argues for getting our policy rate quickly to the top end or slightly above the neutral range. Before I turn to your questions, let me say a few words about the Governing Council's policy discussions. We noted that major global events, including the war in Ukraine and severe COVID-19 restrictions in China, have not abated and are putting upward pressure on inflation and dampening global growth. And we recognized that the resolution of global supply disruptions remains difficult to predict. We discussed the momentum in domestic demand and how it is becoming a more prominent driver of inflation in Canada. A wide range of labour market indicators, including the record-low unemployment rate, widespread labour shortages and higher wage growth, all point to an economy that is overheated. We also reviewed measures of inflation expectations at some length. The prevailing view in consumer and business surveys is that the Bank of Canada will ultimately control inflation. At the same time, these surveys clearly suggest inflation expectations have moved up and are becoming more dispersed, with more respondents now seeing high inflation persisting. Market-based measures of inflation expectations over the next two years as well as the projections of professional forecasters have also risen, though they remain consistent with the 2% inflation target over the longer term. While the Governing Council was reassured that the inflation target remains credible overall, we recognized this credibility is being tested. Demand in the economy is running ahead of supply, inflation is high, and uncertainty about future inflation has increased. All of that led us to the decision we took today to accelerate the path to higher interest rates. We did not take this decision lightly. We are acutely aware that higher interest rates will affect Canadians who are already feeling the pain of high inflation. It can seem counterintuitive to add to the interest costs Canadians face in order to combat the cost of inflation. But by increasing the cost of borrowing we will moderate spending and return inflation to target. We need to get price changes back to normal. This matters because it gives people predictability--to plan their spending and savings decisions, to budget, to live their lives without having to worry about what things are going to cost next week, next month or next year. The way to protect people from high inflation is to eliminate it. That's our job, and we are determined to do it. The Governing Council is resolute in its commitment to price stability. With that, let me stop and turn to you for questions.","['inflation', 'monetary', 'rates', 'cpi', 'savings']","['inflation canada', 'canadians inflation', 'inflation canadians', 'rising inflation', 'inflation increasing']","['boosted inflation canada', 'inflation canadians experiencing', 'stable inflation canadians', 'inflation broadening canadian', 'economy canadians inflation']","['high inflation', 'tighter monetary policy', 'interest costs canadians', 'stable inflation', 'future inflation']"

Following their issuance, the Committee has deemed it appropriate to evaluate the impact of those standards already implemented on the resilience and behaviour of the banking system. As part of this evaluation, the Committee has started to assess the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic's impact on the banking system, as it has posed a significant global test of the Basel reforms. This report provides a preliminary assessment of whether the reforms implemented thus far have functioned as intended in light of the pandemic, which has resulted in a pronounced global economic shock, albeit one significantly different in nature from the financial crisis that motivated the Basel reforms. The report reflects the Committee's initial findings based upon empirical analysis of a combination of vendor and regulatory data, case studies and the results of a supervisory survey conducted by the Committee. The findings of this report should be considered in light of (i) the incomplete data available to date regarding the impact of the pandemic, which continues to unfold and whose full effect on the economy may not yet be clear, and (ii) the difficulty of distinguishing between the effects of the Basel reforms and those of the extensive and wide-ranging monetary and fiscal support measures undertaken by authorities to address the economic impact of the pandemic. The report finds that the increased quality and higher levels of capital and liquidity held by banks have helped them absorb the sizeable impact of the Covid-19 pandemic thus far, suggesting that the Basel reforms have achieved their broad objective of strengthening the resiliency of the banking system. Banks and the banking system would have faced greater stress had the Basel reforms not been adopted. Throughout the unprecedented global economic downturn the banking system has continued to perform its fundamental functions, as banks have continued to provide credit and other critical services. While the report finds that some features of the Basel reforms, including the functioning of capital and liquidity buffers, the degree of countercyclicality in the framework, and the treatment of central bank reserves in the leverage ratio may warrant further consideration, it does not seek to draw firm conclusions regarding the need for potential revisions to the reforms. Following a brief narrative regarding the impact of the pandemic on the banking system this report outlines the Committee's initial findings regarding (i) the overall resilience of the banking system during the pandemic ( ); (ii) the usability of capital buffers, members' experience with the countercyclical capital policies and price movements of Additional Tier 1 (AT1) capital instruments ); (iv) the impact of the leverage ratio on financial intermediation ); and (v) the cyclicality of specific Basel capital requirements ( As noted, the analysis indicates that the banking system has remained resilient through the pandemic, strengthened by substantial increases in capital and liquidity held by banks since the adoption of the Basel reforms. No internationally active bank has failed or required significant public sector funding since the onset of the pandemic, though future losses may emerge as the pandemic remains ongoing. Banks have generally managed to absorb temporary increases in the costs of liquidity and higher credit risk while substantially maintaining their services to customers. Market measures of resilience (eg banks' credit default swap (CDS) spreads) do, however, indicate that some banks experienced strain early in the experienced smaller increases in CDS spreads. Moreover, the analysis indicates that more strongly capitalised banks showed greater increases in lending to businesses and households than other banks. Thus, the global banking system has been able to complement and support monetary and fiscal authorities' efforts to maintain economic activity during the pandemic, helping to absorb the shock rather than amplifying it, as occurred during the 2007-09 financial crisis. The analysis indicates that most banks maintained capital ratios well above their minimum requirements and buffers during the pandemic partially due to authorities reducing capital requirements and buffers and imposing restrictions on capital distributions via dividend payments and share buybacks, as well as due to the extensive fiscal and monetary support provided to borrowers. This makes it difficult to draw conclusions regarding banks' willingness to use capital buffers. Though some evidence suggests that banks may have been hesitant to use their regulatory capital buffers had it been necessary. Regression results, including a detailed study of loan data from the euro area, indicate that banks that had less headroom (ie the amount of capital resources above minimum capital regulatory requirements and buffers) tended to lend less during the pandemic than those with more headroom. However, it is unclear whether this reluctance to use capital buffers reflects banks' uncertainty regarding potential future losses or the wider market stigma that may result if a bank were to operate in its buffers. Most authorities that maintained a positive countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) prior to the pandemic reduced them in order to provide banks with additional headroom. Similarly, several authorities that did not have positive CCyBs lowered other regulatory requirements or buffer levels. While it is difficult to assess the quantitative effect of these capital releases independent of other measures, analysis provides some evidence that the capital release had a positive effect on lending during the pandemic. These findings, taken together with supervisors' survey responses, suggest that it may be beneficial to consider whether there is sufficient releasable capital in place to address future systemic shocks. The report also includes an analysis of price and yield movements of AT1 capital instruments compared to those of subordinated debt instruments and common equity. The analysis indicates that the pandemic resulted in increased AT1 yield premia for both preferred stock and contingent convertible securities relative to unsecured debt, suggesting that market participants generally perceived AT1 instruments to be riskier than debt. Furthermore, thus far during the pandemic, the two types of AT1 instruments have experienced broadly similar price movements indicating that investors do not perceive one instrument to be riskier than the other. Regression analyses also show that AT1 prices are positively associated with both equity and subordinated long-term debt prices. The report does not directly seek to address the issue of AT1 instruments' loss-absorption capacity on a going-concern basis. Certain banks faced liquidity pressure in the early phase of the pandemic. The severity of the pressure largely depended on banks' funding models. For example, banks reliant on unsecured wholesale money markets were more likely to have experienced pressure as funding sources dried up and they experienced large draws on loan facilities. In contrast, banks with stable deposit franchises experienced negligible liquidity pressure even at the peak of the stress. While an increase in the amount of high-quality liquid assets that the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) requires banks to hold helped banks absorb this liquidity pressure, measures taken by central banks and governments to support economies significantly reduced liquidity pressures. Overall, banks met large drawdown demands on committed lines and engaged in early buybacks of funding instruments from money market funds. Despite relatively limited liquidity stress, some jurisdictional studies highlighted that a range of banks took defensive action, reflecting in part their targeting of internal LCR levels well above 100%. However, these actions do not appear to have contributed materially to the wider disruption in financial markets that prompted central banks to intervene in March 2020. While the leverage ratio (which has not yet been implemented by all member jurisdictions) was not a binding constraint for most banks during the pandemic, the analysis - based on detailed jurisdictional studies - examines whether banks that had a smaller amount of capital above leverage ratio requirements and buffers were less active than other banks in financial market intermediation during the pandemic. Overall, bank positions in government bond and repurchase agreement (repo) markets remained stable or rose in response to the rapid surge in client demand for liquidity at the onset of the crisis, though there is evidence that leverage ratio requirements may have reduced banks' incentives to mitigate the large imbalances that emerged in some markets. Several member jurisdictions temporarily exempted central bank reserves from the leverage ratio calculation, which eased banks' balance sheet constraints on their intermediation activity. The report concludes with an early examination of the cyclicality (defined as the extent to which regulatory requirements respond in the opposite direction to movements in economic activity) of the impact of credit loss provisions and market risk requirements on capital positions during the pandemic. The analysis indicates that extensive governmental support measures to borrowers significantly dampened the impact of the economic contraction on bank capital. Measures taken to delay the recognition of credit provisions in the measurement of regulatory capital also deferred the impact. Collectively, these measures make it difficult to draw conclusions about the cyclicality of capital requirements. The analysis finds that sources of cyclicality in the current (ie Basel 2.5) market risk framework prompted supervisors to take relief measures in several jurisdictions. However, revisions to this framework, agreed upon in January 2019, are expected to mitigate these sources of cyclicality. The analysis presented herein will be updated and included, as relevant, in a more comprehensive evaluation report covering the Basel reforms implemented over the past decade that the Committee plans to publish in 2022 as additional data on the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic becomes available. developed a new set of regulatory standards commonly referred to as the Basel reforms. These reforms aimed to strengthen the regulation, supervision and risk management of banks. Nearly a decade after this initiative began, the Committee has deemed it appropriate to evaluate the impact that these reforms have had on the banking system. As part of this evaluation, the Committee has assessed the impact of these reforms on the resilience and behaviour of banks during the Covid-19 pandemic, which has posed a significant test of the reforms on a global scale. This report presents the Committee's evaluation, which is based on a combination of vendor and regulatory bank-level data, jurisdictional case studies and the results of supervisory surveys. The data used are described in Annex 1. The findings in this report are not fully comprehensive or conclusive as the pandemic is ongoing and its full effects on the banking system may not yet have emerged. As such, the report does not seek to draw firm conclusions regarding the need for potential revisions to the Basel reforms. The analysis presented herein will be updated and included, as relevant, in a full evaluation report on the Basel reforms to be published in 2022. The spread of the Covid-19 virus and the measures taken to control it resulted in large asset price declines, severe dislocations in funding markets and extraordinary economic contractions around the world. Governments and central banks responded with extensive fiscal, monetary and regulatory support measures. In contrast to the GFC, in which banks were the sources and propagators of stress, to date banks have remained resilient and have complemented public sector support by continuing to provide core financial services to help cushion the impact of the pandemic on the broader economy. In the early months of 2020, as the Covid-19 virus spread from country to country, authorities reacted by imposing lockdowns and social distancing measures. Production ceased in many sectors. Households cut back on spending and increased precautionary savings. Many people were unable to work, and unemployment rates rose in many jurisdictions. While the timing of Covid-19 outbreaks and containment measures differed across jurisdictions, close economic and financial interdependencies resulted in the rapid transmission of the shock through global markets. In March 2020, concerns about the trajectory of the pandemic and its impact on economic growth sharply diminished risk appetite, as evidenced by periods of extreme volatility in equity and other spiked to levels not seen since 2008. Credit spreads widened sharply, especially for high-yield bonds. Issuance of leveraged loans and private debt largely ceased and emerging markets experienced large capital outflows and sharp movements in foreign exchange rates. The sudden downturn in economic activity was associated with a sharp rise in the demand for liquidity amid concerns about businesses' ability to absorb the shock. Many non-financial corporates pre-emptively drew down existing credit lines to build cash reserves in order to cope with dwindling revenues due to pandemic containment measures. In 2020, listed non-financial corporates' net credit drawdowns were significantly higher than in equivalent periods in 2019 (Graph 2). Non-bank financial intermediaries also faced a growing need for liquidity. Increased demand from corporates and investors for precautionary holdings of cash and highly liquid assets led to outflows from investment funds, including certain money market funds (Graph 3). Leveraged investors also faced liquidity pressure, with some reportedly forced to close out positions in order to meet margin calls due to changes in asset prices. Market liquidity also deteriorated, including in markets traditionally seen as deep and liquid (Graph 4). In particular, signs of stress emerged in a range of short-term funding markets - including bond, commercial paper and repo markets - as leveraged and unleveraged investors reduced their activity. In mid-March 2020, extreme selling pressure spread to even the most liquid government bond markets. Dealers helped alleviate these liquidity strains by extending repo financing, absorbing sales and building inventories of securities. However, their ability to meet unprecedented demand for liquidity was constrained by falling risk appetite in volatile markets and the need to manage their own balance sheet constraints. Foreign exchange (FX) markets continued to function despite the strain, although the relative cost of offshore USD increased. In particular, in mid-March 2020, USD-based FX and swap markets experienced significant increases in cost and volatility (Graph 5). Jurisdictions took extensive policy action on multiple fronts in response to the crisis. Central banks introduced a range of monetary interventions, which included lowering policy rates, extending asset purchase programmes and providing liquidity support. Fiscal authorities offered extensive support to the corporate sector via loan guarantees and schemes to support payment of salaries. Authorities also worked with banks to put in place loan payment deferrals. These measures helped cushion the economic impact of the pandemic, although there were inevitable sharp declines in output across the world (Graph 6). There were also policies directed at the functioning of banking systems. These largely temporary measures fell into the following three groups: Measures to enhance the availability of bank funding and liquidity, which included central bank term funding, liquidity for lending schemes and activation of swap lines. Measures to help free up existing bank resources, which included encouraging the use of liquidity and capital buffers, steps to mitigate increases in risk-weighted capital requirements and reductions in certain capital and leverage requirements and buffers. Measures to help conserve capital, which included distribution restrictions, extending the transition period for deduction of provisions from capital, and loan guarantees. These countercyclical interventions aimed to help mitigate the economic downturn by supporting banks in meeting liquidity and credit demand from borrowers. Collectively, these measures helped stabilise key markets. Market risk appetite improved and asset prices recovered from Q2 2020 onwards. Banks entered the pandemic with robust capital and liquidity ratios that had materially increased since the GFC (Section 2). Banks' capital ratios and LCRs remained robust throughout the pandemic, enabling them to meet loan demand and complement the broader support measures taken by authorities. Loan demand, from both households and corporates, increased sharply in many jurisdictions during the crisis, although it varied across jurisdictions. Bank lending generally increased early in the pandemic (Graph 7), in many cases supported by the provision of public loan guarantees, although lending growth generally While banks entered the crisis with stronger capital and liquidity positions, bank valuations were significantly impacted, particularly in the initial phase of the pandemic. Banks were among the worst performers during the stock market sell-off in March 2020, with bank equity prices dropping by lower-rated banks and more junior instruments suffered the greatest impact (Graph 8). Between mid-February and mid-March, wholesale funding costs increased sharply for some banks, particularly lower-rated banks, and some faced temporary pressure on their liquidity positions (Section 4). Banks that relied on unsecured wholesale money markets and that faced large drawdowns on loan facilities tended to face higher pressure. In contrast, pressure on banks with stable deposit franchises was limited even at the peak of the stress, since drawdowns on credit lines were often deposited at those same banks. With respect to capital pressure, institutions exposed to increased market volatility faced higher capital requirements on market risk exposures early on in the pandemic. Some banks grew concerned about potential balance sheet constraints, particularly in the face of heightened demand for the resolution of market imbalances caused by the withdrawal of non-bank financial institutions. Many banks' profitability fell as higher loss provisioning compounded a pre-existing compression of net interest margins (Graph 9 Bank equity prices recovered towards the end of 2020, although they lagged behind the broader market (Graph 9 (ii)). CDS spreads gradually stabilised, with spreads for higher-rated banks returning to close to their pre-crisis levels by Q2 2020, although spreads at lower-rated banks remained more elevated. Provisioning rates fell in Q3 2020 as concerns about deterioration in credit quality stabilised, in part due to the extensive and ongoing support offered to borrowers. The easing of provisioning rates, the imposition of capital conservation measures, the adoption of loan guarantees and countercyclical regulatory measures collectively resulted in capital ratios increasing for a wide range of banks in the second half of the year, notwithstanding continued lending growth. Throughout the unprecedented global macroeconomic downturn, the banking system has continued to perform its fundamental functions, with payment services remaining intact and banks continuing to provide credit and other critical services, aided by extraordinary public support measures. The sustained growth in lending during this crisis contrasts sharply with what happened during the GFC (Graph 10). Bank resilience has complemented broader support to the economy from governments and central banks, helping banks provide many borrowers with a bridge across the crisis. Bank resilience has been bolstered by broad public sector support to the economy. As this support is removed, additional bank losses could emerge. Additionally, a longer-term consequence of the pandemic will be higher corporate and government debt, posing additional risks to the banking sector in the future. Finally, the pandemic is not over and there is still potential for further economic and financial market disruption. A key objective of the Basel reforms is to build a resilient banking system that can absorb shocks and continue to support economic activity. Bank resilience helps mitigate the adverse consequences of shocks and facilitates a rapid recovery once a crisis abates. This section examines the resilience of the global banking system during the pandemic and investigates the extent to which the Basel reforms may have contributed to such resilience. The lack of failure of any internationally-active banks to date during the pandemic demonstrates the resilience of the global banking system. While governments and central banks have provided exceptional support to the economy, indirectly supporting banks, most major banks have not needed a significant infusion of public funds, nor have they sustained heavy losses or faced extended liquidity pressure. Rather, the banking system has continued to provide essential financial services to the economy during this period. This section provides a time series analysis of resilience, focusing on the period since the implementation of the Basel reforms in the early 2010s to the present. of large banks. The assessment looks at banks' risk-weighted regulatory capital ratios, non-risk-based leverage ratios, and the two liquidity metrics included in the Basel reforms: the LCR and the Net Stable As shown in Table 1, banks' overall resilience has, in general, significantly improved since the adoption of the initial Basel reforms. From 2013 to the end of 2019, banks' capital, leverage and liquidity positions improved as reforms were implemented. As of 30 June 2020, approximately three months into the Covid-19 crisis, banks' capital, leverage and liquidity positions had remained strong and did not appear to be significantly impacted by the pandemic, reflecting in part the exceptional policy support measures that had been taken. had all improved significantly compared to year-end 2013 across Group 1 banks, global systemically nearly 300 basis points (bp) for Group 1 banks and G-SIBs, and by more than 500 bp for Group 2 banks. Following the outbreak of the pandemic, weighted-average capital ratios declined slightly (by less than Overall, banks maintained their strong capital positions during the pandemic, demonstrating general resilience against a significant and unprecedented negative economic shock. This result also reflects fiscal support measures that helped reduce loan losses and payout restrictions, which in turn helped banks retain capital. Liquidity positions have also improved materially, both qualitatively and quantitatively, since end-2013. Both the LCR and NSFR were notably higher for Group 1 and Group 2 banks by end-2019. During this period, as banks built up liquidity buffers, the LCR increased by an average of approximately 15 percentage points (pp) for Group 1 and Group 2 banks and by a more modest but significant average of 6 pp for G-SIBs. NSFR data suggests a more modest improvement in banks' funding stability, possibly because the NSFR is still in the process of being implemented globally. Both liquidity metrics were further strengthened over the first half of 2020. Note that capital levels in many jurisdictions have been bolstered in 2020 by government, regulatory, monetary and fiscal policy assistance measures, including temporary debt relief programmes. While the pandemic may ease as vaccinations become more widespread, some jurisdictions could see meaningful deterioration in capital ratios, particularly as support is withdrawn. Graph 11 (i) examines Group 1 banks' CET1 capital ratios across different regions over time and demonstrates that the build-up in resilience has been a global phenomenon. Prior to the pandemic, consistent improvement was seen across regions, with capital ratios increasing by 200-400 bp from 2014 to 2019. While some regions showed a modest decline in capital ratios during the Covid-19 pandemic, capital levels are still well above those seen in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Notably, capital levels in Europe continued to rise during the pandemic, in contrast to those in many other jurisdictions. This could be due to a variety of factors, including the build-up of capital due to payout restrictions, the reduced riskiness of portfolios due to loan guarantees, and differences in accounting practices regarding loan-loss provisioning. Leverage ratios have also markedly improved since the introduction of the Basel reforms. As indicated in Graph 11 (ii), weighted-average leverage ratios for Group 1 banks improved by 100-200 bp in all regions and remained robust throughout the first six months of the pandemic in most regions. It should be noted that banks' leverage ratios in some jurisdictions reflect exemptions put in place during the pandemic to help reduce the bindingness of the leverage ratio requirement. The steady increase in global banks' LCR levels after 2013 was driven in part by European banks (Graph 11 (iii)). More importantly, banks across all regions entered the pandemic with strong liquidity positions, and further strengthened them during the crisis. Actions taken by many monetary authorities to provide ample liquidity, combined with growth in deposits, may have helped banks maintain strong liquidity positions during the pandemic. A detailed case study of the Mexican banking system (Annex 3) demonstrates the LCR's contribution to banks' resilience. Following the implementation of the LCR in Mexico in 2015, Mexican banks' liquidity resilience increased significantly. A counterfactual analysis reveals that, had banks entered the pandemic with the same liquidity profile that they had in 2014 (before Mexico implemented the LCR), approximately a quarter of Mexican banks would have faced materially greater liquidity stress. Instead, few Mexican banks faced liquidity demands that exceeded their holdings of high-quality liquid assets, and those banks were able to meet these demands by using other available resources such as deposits at other banks. Market-based capital measures provide another perspective of the resilience of the banking system (Graph 12 (i)). The market-based capital ratio (ie market value of common equity/(market value of common equity + book value of total debt)) indicates that market-based measures of resilience remained mostly unchanged and at a relatively low level between 2013 and 2019. This may reflect the downward pressures on bank profitability arising from the prevailing low interest environment. While market-based capital measures fell sharply with the onset of the pandemic, they have regained some of these losses since authorities stepped in to provide fiscal and monetary support. As shown in Graph 12 (ii), the distribution of market-based capital ratios shifted notably to the left at the peak of the pandemic, before government support measures were introduced. Specifically, the fraction of banks with a market-based capital ratio below 2% had risen sharply to 20% as of 31 March 2020, indicating concern among market participants. One interpretation of these movements is that market-based capital measures may be more responsive to banks' underlying health than regulatory metrics. Another interpretation is that they indicate changes in investors' risk preferences. Notwithstanding the above, the global pandemic is not yet over, and the recent collapses of the investment funds Archegos Capital Management and Greensill Capital, while not directly related to the ongoing pandemic, raise the possibility that other losses may emerge in the financial system. Examining whether the degree to which the Basel reforms have been implemented relates to resilience metrics provides additional perspective on how the reforms have contributed to the overall resilience of the global banking system. Here, one finds a weak positive relationship between the degree of implementation and banks' increase in CET1 capital from 2013 to 2019, indicating that the implementation of the Basel reforms may have helped build resilience in the global banking system. weaker-than-expected relationship may reflect the fact that some banks already had relatively high capital levels, bolstered by the deleveraging that followed the GFC, when the Basel reforms were introduced.

7668,r220714a_FOMC,united states,2022-07-14,Monetary Policy in a World of Conflicting Data,waller,0,"Thank you, Mike, and thank you to the Global Interdependence Center for the invitation to speak to you today. Let me start at the place that all remarks about U.S. monetary policy should start, which is with the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. As I discuss below, we have a very strong labor market, with an unemployment rate that is below the median of policymakers' expected longer-run level, and high inflation that is far above our target. We are achieving our mandate when it comes to maximum employment, but we are far from achieving our goal of stable prices. Consequently, while any monetary policy decision has implications for achieving maximum employment, and I will address those implications in a moment, the FOMC is now, and must be, utterly focused on moving inflation down toward our 2 percent target. We must be focused on reducing inflation because, despite a lot of talk about recession lately, the evidence from the labor market indicates the economy is on track, while inflation continues to be far too high . It must be our focus because high inflation is the biggest challenge to sustaining our employment goal, and the greatest burden for individuals and families, especially lower- and moderate-income households that dedicate a larger share of their spending to necessities. Inflation has to be our focus, every meeting and every day, because the spending and pricing decisions people and businesses make every day depend on their expectations of future inflation, which in turn depend on whether they believe the Fed is sufficiently committed to its inflation target.  So let me be clear: I am going to vote to set policy in a manner that will reduce inflation and achieve our price stability goal, and today I will explain why I don't see that progress conflicting with our maximum-employment goal. Let me start with my view of the labor market and inflation, then turn to the implications for monetary policy, and conclude with where I think the economy is headed. As many economists are discussing, recent economic data have created a puzzle. The labor market continues to be very strong, but the real economy appears to be faltering. How might gross domestic product (GDP) fall in the first half of 2022 while the economy created 2.7 million jobs in the same time period? Is the labor market not as strong as it appears or is the economy doing better than the data suggests? To assess the strength of the labor market, there are numerous indicators of its health, and sometimes they point in different directions. Today isn't one of those times. Based on every major labor market indicator, the labor market is very strong and, in historical terms, very tight. The timeliest evidence for this strength was the jobs report that came out last Friday for the month of June, which found that the economy created 372,000 jobs. Now, I will admit my vision isn't what it used to be, but with revisions to May and April, it is hard to see any slowing in the pace of monthly job creation since economy has created 2.7 million jobs. That isn't a picture of a weakening job market. The unemployment rate in June was steady at 3.6 percent. It is often said that this is ""close to a half-century low"" and that is true, but you really have to go back 69 years, to  1953, to find the unemployment rate more than a couple tenths of a point lower than it was in June. This is about as good a job market as any worker has ever seen. The June job report is consistent with other labor market indicators. Job vacancies--an indicator I have highlighted in past speeches--are unprecedentedly high, with nearly two jobs for every person looking, and that hasn't changed very much this year. Job postings, measured by the Labor Department for May and by Indeed for June, have fallen a bit in recent months but are still at historically high levels, consistent with a very tight labor market. As a share of the labor force, weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance are near record lows and have been fairly steady all year. Businesses continue to report that jobs are plentiful and small business owners say that jobs are very hard to fill. Looking more broadly across 24 labor market metrics summarized by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, we see that activity is above its pre-pandemic level, and the Atlanta Fed's labor market distributions spider chart shows that the vast majority of labor market indicators are about as tight or tighter than just before the pandemic. The broad range of data showing a very strong labor market indicate that this isn't a mismeasurement issue. Turning to GDP, there are signs of slowing in economic activity. The Commerce Department estimates that there was a modest contraction in real GDP for the first quarter of the year, and ""nowcasting"" projections of economic activity, such as the Atlanta Fed's  GDPNow tracker, foresee a similar contraction in the second quarter. There is also softness in recent spending data, which has been widespread across consumer spending, business investment, housing, and government purchases, as well as some weaker indicators for the manufacturing sector and a deterioration in consumer sentiment, which by some measures are at historically low levels. Some argue that a recession has already started. But I don't see how that squares with the job creation data, the low unemployment rate, and overall strong labor market that I described earlier. In addition to the contrasting evidence in the labor market, there are several other reasons why I am very cautious about acting on the GDP estimates and on projections of an output slowdown. One is that while first quarter real GDP is now estimated to have shrunk by 1.6 percent, according to another estimate, real gross domestic income (GDI) increased by 1.8 percent. GDP and GDI are basically measuring the same activity in different ways, and in the past when such wide gaps in the two numbers have appeared initially, they tend to move toward each other when the data are finalized. We know that there were some unusual trade-related reasons for the low GDP number in the first quarter that are unlikely to be repeated, and revisions in both GDP and GDI could largely erase that contraction in output. And, the data that point to some slowing don't convince me that it will damage the labor market. Measures of manufacturing activity and indicators of future activity, such as the purchasing manager's index, have moderated but are still in expansionary territory. Rather than a recession, the softening data seem consistent with the pandemic-  related transition underway since last year among consumers from spending on goods to spending on services. And we should expect that as policy tightening feeds through the economy it will dampen household and business spending decisions--that is the objective of our policy tightening. Past experience has shown that job creation and the unemployment rate are timely indicators of a recession, more timely than quarterly GDP. I will watch all the data carefully, but the factors I just cited, along with the evident strength across different measures of the labor market, leave me feeling fairly confident that the U.S. economy did not enter a recession in the first half of 2022 and that the economic expansion will continue. Now let's talk about inflation. Yesterday's report on the consumer price index (CPI) for June was a major league disappointment. On a twelve-month basis, total inflation stood at 9.1 percent, the highest in 40 years. Core, which came down slightly in the last couple months, has averaged over 6 percent this year, and is too high as well. No matter how you look at the data, inflation is far too high and my job is to move it down toward our 2 percent target. We know that supply shortages and bottlenecks, including the tight labor market, have contributed to the high inflation readings we are observing. We also know that the surge in demand during the pandemic that was driven by excess saving, significant fiscal stimulus, and accommodative monetary policy also has contributed to the high inflation we are now experiencing. There is some research estimating how much of this inflation  came from supply problems and how much from high demand. The main point is that both played a large part in driving the inflation that we have seen over the past year. But the causes of inflation don't affect my approach to policy because in writing the FOMC's mandate, Congress did not say ""Your goal is price stability unless inflation is caused by supply shocks, in which case you are off the hook."" We want to reduce excessive inflation, whatever the source, in part because whether it comes from supply or demand, high inflation can push up longer-run inflation expectations and thus affect spending and pricing decisions in the near term. These decisions can then push up prices even more and make inflation harder to get under control. I pay attention to both surveys of the public's inflation expectations and measures of inflation expectations derived from trading of inflation-indexed securities. I prefer the latter market-based measures, which are down from recent peaks but still elevated. The Board staff combines various surveys and market-based measures in our Index of Common Inflation Expectations, which has moved up slightly in recent months after being flat for a long time. We need to avoid expectations rising so much that they become a factor that drives inflation higher. So, based on persistently high inflation and the very tight labor market that I have described, let's talk about the implications for monetary policy. Since March, the FOMC  has raised the federal funds rate three times for a cumulative 150 basis points. This is the fastest pace of tightening in close to 30 years. At our last meeting, we raised the policy rate by 75 basis points, which is a large move by historical standards. That size increase was not an over-reaction to one data point on inflation--it was primarily the response to a sequence of excessively high inflation readings since the beginning of the year. It was appropriate given the lack of progress on inflation and clearly signals the FOMC's commitment to get inflation under control as soon as possible. The response of financial markets to the FOMC's policy actions and communications indicate to me that the Committee retains the credibility and the public confidence that is needed to make monetary policy effective. Longer-term interest rates have moved up to levels not far from those reflected in Committee members' estimates of the final destination for the federal funds rate in this tightening cycle, effectively implementing policy ahead of time. The average rate for a 30-year conforming fixed rate home mortgage has increased by more than two percentage points since the end of 2021. While there is some slowdown in home sales, lenders and borrowers are still doing business at these rates, which indicates that they believe the FOMC's policy intentions are credible, as broadly reflected in the interest rate paths in the Summary of Economic As I have said before, with inflation so high, there is a virtue in front-loading tightening so that policy moves as soon as is practical to a setting that restricts demand. Getting there sooner will bolster the public's confidence that we can get inflation down and it will preserve options for adjusting the pace of tightening later if needed.  With this view, it should not be surprising that looking toward the FOMC's next meeting July 26-27, and with the CPI data in hand, I support another 75-basis point increase, bringing the target range for the federal funds rate to 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent before August. I judge that level is close to neutral, by which I mean a level that neither stimulates nor restricts demand, assuming that the economy is growing moderately (at its potential) and unemployment is roughly where it is now. However, my base case for July depends on incoming data. We have important data releases on retail sales and housing coming in before the July meeting. If that data come in materially stronger than expected it would make me lean towards a larger hike at the July meeting to the extent it shows demand is not slowing down fast enough to get inflation down. Based on what we know about inflation today, I expect that further increases in the target range will be needed to make monetary policy restrictive, but that will depend on economic data in the coming weeks and months. Between the end of July and the FOMC's September meeting, we will get two employment and CPI reports with data for July and August. I will be looking for signs that inflation has started its move down toward our 2 percent target on a sustained basis. I anticipate a decline in inflation will come as actual and anticipated hikes by the FOMC cool demand for products and labor, which will help demand and supply come into a better balance. The decline in the rate of inflation will also be assisted by continued improvement in goods supply bottlenecks, which is occurring in some sectors, and an increase in labor force participation, which is still significantly lower than it was before the pandemic. I hope these supply recoveries happen, but my expectations for  policy don't rely on it. I expect rate increases will continue after July at a pace that is dependent on the incoming data. After the July meeting, further increases will be restricting demand. Looking further in the future, I will need to see how the tightening this year is affecting the economy and bringing inflation down toward our 2 percent target. Based on my forecast for the economy, I expect monetary policy to be restrictive until there has been a sustained reduction in core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation, which excludes food and energy. Food and energy prices tend to be volatile, so focusing on core PCE inflation is a good guide to inflation pressures in the near and medium term. Importantly, as futures prices for commodities--food, energy, raw materials--have declined recently, I am expecting total PCE inflation to decline in coming months. But until I see a significant moderation in core prices, I support further rate hikes. In talking about where monetary policy is headed, it is helpful to get a fix on where it is right now. I mentioned the concept of a ""neutral"" interest rate, and the belief that the federal funds rate will be close to neutral after another 75-basis point increase at the end of this month. But some would argue that monetary policy is actually further away from neutral, based on the fact that current inflation is so much higher than the federal funds rate. In my view, that rests on a flawed idea of how monetary policy affects spending decisions. That's because spending decisions that require borrowing are based on an outlook that extends several years. This means taking into consideration longer-term real rates, which are tied to the expected path of policy and inflation over the next several years.  As a result, I think that estimates of the real federal funds rate should be based on the expected policy rate one to one and a half years in the future. Based on trading in inflation-indexed Treasury securities of different maturities (compared to nominal Treasury securities), investors see federal funds rates above expected inflation starting about six months from now and steepening thereafter. Primary securities dealers surveyed by the New York Fed likewise estimate the real federal funds rate will be a positive 0.7 percent in mid-2023 and 1 percent by mid-2024. This gives me some confidence that tightening now anticipated by markets and expected by FOMC participants will be sufficient to reduce demand and inflation. Evolution of the Economy The FOMC's plan for getting inflation under control depends on a view of the economic outlook. As I have noted in past speeches, accurate economic forecasting is very hard, especially when unusual factors, like a war, and unprecedented factors, like a pandemic, buffet the global economy. FOMC participants record their individual outlooks that are presented every three months in the SEP. At our June meeting, the latest SEP shows that there is some expectation among participants for what is often referred to as a soft landing. With a policy path like what I described for this year and a bit more tightening next year, the median SEP respondent projected that total PCE inflation is expected to fall from its current elevated level today to 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2024. At the same time, the unemployment rate is projected to rise to  3.7 percent at the end of this year and to 4.1 percent by the end of 2024, while GDP would grow below its long-run trend for the next two years. Of course, we can't be very certain about the path of the economy more than a few months in the future, but this medium-term view of a soft landing is very plausible. I say this based on the optimistic view I expressed earlier about the strength of the labor market and on my analysis of the relationship between job vacancies and the unemployment rate. In a recent speech, I noted that we have an historically high number of job vacancies compared to the number of unemployed people. Some people have argued that past experience indicates we cannot reduce this large number of vacancies without a big increase in the unemployment rate. But I have showed that past experience actually indicates that a reduction in vacancies can take place without a big loss of employment, and this is the kind of soft landing anticipated by FOMC participants. So, while some data measures suggest the chances of recession have increased, I believe it can be avoided. Uncertainty over how the pandemic could afflict the economy in the future, and global economic risks related to the war in Ukraine are considerable. These factors could make future policy decisions more difficult than they are today. However, for the reasons I have laid out, and considering the evidence on the state of the economy and the outlook, I don't find it difficult to reaffirm my strong conviction that continued policy tightening will be appropriate to move inflation down toward our 2 percent target. I think we need  to move swiftly and decisively to get inflation falling in a sustained way, and then consider what further tightening will be needed to achieve our dual mandate","['inflation', 'recession', 'unemployment', 'monetary', 'economy']","['inflation target', 'run inflation', 'monetary policy', 'current inflation', 'inflation continues']","['labor market inflation', 'inflation tight labor', 'inflation far target', 'reduce excessive inflation', 'implications monetary policy']","['inflation target', 'monetary policy', 'current inflation', 'excessive inflation', 'accommodative monetary policy']"
6124,r220718a_BOE,united kingdom,2022-07-18,"Some reflections on Monetary Policy past, present and future",saunders,0,"My January presentation at the Central Exchange, greater Kansas City's business women's association, has become an annual event and an opportunity that I have enjoyed immensely. am personally a supporter of this campaign to increase the number of women on boards of directors and in executive positions in greater Kansas City to a level of 20 percent by 2015. More importantly, I am a believer in the business case for gender diversity and am fortunate to have an outstanding leadership team at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. It happens that 50 percent of those positions are filled by women. Currently the immediate past chairman and current deputy chairman of our Board is Lu Cordova, an entrepreneur's entrepreneur from Boulder, Colo. She was an outstanding chair during difficult economic and benefitted from her outstanding leadership. Lu will be speaking here at the Central Exchange in March, and I encourage you to attend that program as well. Today I want to discuss two related topics. First, I will outline my economic outlook for 2011. And since it is because of my outlook for the economy during this past year that I have found myself in the minority view among my colleagues at the Federal Reserve, I will to spend just a few minutes discussing the monetary policy process. The economic outlook As we begin 2011, recent economic data indicate a firmer tone in the outlook, and I am increasingly confident that the recovery is both sustainable and likely to gain strength over the next several quarters. That said, I expect the recovery to be moderate, with real GDP growing about 3 1/2 to 4 percent a year over the next couple years. To put this outlook into perspective, it is important to remember that a major and necessary rebalancing - including the deleveraging of consumers, businesses, and financial institutions - is taking place within our economy. Moreover, this is occurring while state and local governments are struggling with budgets and mounting debt loads. With these adjustments, growth necessarily will be more modest than in past recoveries. Under such circumstances, the fact that we can talk about the likelihood of a sustainable recovery is highly encouraging. Before turning to the outlook for this year, let me begin with a brief look back at economic events in 2010. Last year began with solid gains in the first quarter. The nation's real GDP grew at an annual rate of 3.7 percent and employment rose 261,000. Then the economy hit a soft patch in the middle of the year with growth in output and employment slowing. Fortunately, though, we appear to be coming out of that soft patch with the economy growing at a 2.6 percent rate in the third quarter and expected to accelerate to about a 3 percent rate in the fourth quarter. Over the last few months, we have seen clear signs of improvement. Consumer spending has steadily trended up and is likely to gain further strength as confidence rebounds, personal incomes continue to rise, and the labor market gradually improves. The trend in business spending has been supportive of growth. For example, over the last year, spending on equipment and software increased almost 20 percent. And I expect that strong corporate profits - they grew 26 percent last year - and sales growth will keep business investment a key source of strength going forward. Also, the recently passed fiscal actions, in which Congress and the president extended the Bush-era tax cuts and unemployment insurance, and then also temporarily reduced payroll taxes, will provide a further boost to aggregate demand next year, although not without longer-run risks to the economy. While the consumer and business sectors of the economy are rebounding, the same cannot be said for housing. As you know, housing lost momentum after the end of the homebuyer tax credit, and house prices continue to decline. Moreover, the inventory of unsold homes is exerting downward pressure on house prices and housing activity. As the broader economy continues to grow, though, I expect that we will see a turnaround in housing this year. However, there are many issues tied to the housing crisis that could impede recovery, and much depends on how these issues are addressed in the next several months. Employment is the other issue that seems difficult to understand and solve. Unfortunately, while private jobs are being added to the economy, the pace of job gains is not strong enough to bring unemployment down to where we would all like. In fact, although the United States added over 1 million net new jobs through November, the unemployment rate remained at 9.8 percent. Forward-looking surveys, including our Bank's manufacturing survey, point to gains in employment over the next six months, and if history is any guide, we should see these increases accelerate over the course of the year. I would also note that our manufacturing survey points to expected gains in production and capital spending, which will contribute to improving job growth. Even so, with the number of people out of work and the growing numbers of new job entrants, it will be some time before we see the unemployment rate well below 9 percent. Given the immediate levels of slack in the economy, core inflation will remain modest in the near term. However, given the degree of monetary and fiscal stimulus in place in the economy currently, inflation should move higher over the medium and longer term, depending on what further steps are taken in these policy areas. Also, the risk of further disinflation or outright deflation is small and, with an improving economy, should only decline further in the coming months. It is also noteworthy that long-run inflation expectations even now remain above 2 percent and should exert upward pressure on inflation during the course of the recovery. There are, of course, risks to the outlook. First, I am concerned about what might happen to the economy if we fail to deal successfully with our long-run fiscal challenges. The budget deficit is the largest we have seen, as a share of GDP, since World War II. With these large budget deficits, total federal debt outstanding is almost $14 trillion, or about 94 percent of GDP. Moreover, projections of deficits and debt show the federal debt will continue to increase, suggesting that fiscal policy is unsustainable and must be changed soon. As we have seen elsewhere, the reaction of interest rates and exchange rates to unsustainable fiscal policy can be sharp and disruptive. While specific recommendations on fiscal policy are not the purview of the Federal Reserve, I would urge serious consideration of proposals that have been offered by several groups, including the Simpson-Bowles deficit reduction plan. These are reasonable starting points for addressing the intractable problem that may have very serious ramifications for future monetary policy. A second concern I have is the consequences that will follow when we combine our current fiscal projections with a highly accommodative monetary policy. In essence, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has maintained an emergency monetary policy stance in a recovering economy and has continued to ease into the recovery. I believe these actions risk creating a new set of imbalances, or bubbles. Importantly, such actions as they continue are demanding the saving public and those on fixed incomes subsidize the borrowing public. To summarize, I am pleased to be able to say that in my view the economy is in recovery, although at a moderate pace. Over time, barring unexpected surprises, the recovery should gain momentum, which will encourage hiring and slowly bring down the unemployment rate. While we would all like to see the unemployment rate come down more quickly, and in fact should gain momentum, we must also acknowledge that our economy is adjusting to decades of excess consumption, high government debt and spending, and a low domestic savings level. These factors must also adjust, and this will take time as well. The very fact that we are in what appears to be a sustained recovery speaks well of our economy and its flexibility to adjust and regain strength over time. Dissent and monetary policy deliberations My view of the economy's prospects and the appropriate stance of monetary policy differ from the majority view among my Federal Reserve colleagues. presidents vote in rotation, so I will be a participant rather than a voting member this year. It is a matter of public record that I dissented, or cast a ""no"" vote in all eight meetings in 2010. Based on audience questions, news coverage and pundit columns throughout the year, it has become obvious to me that the role of dissent in the FOMC is misunderstood and viewed without context. The idea that a dissenting vote is confusing, counterproductive, and generally undesirable is unhealthy. It is also historically inaccurate. In my remaining time today, I will discuss why dissenting views at the FOMC are critical to the success of the Federal Reserve System and that public debate was the intent of its congressional founders. I will also describe how open debate and dissent are fundamental to achieving transparency of FOMC deliberations and to supporting the credibility of the committee in difficult economic times. When the Congress created the Federal Reserve nearly a century ago, it believed very strongly that the best policy is not made in isolation, but encompasses a wide range of views from all affected interests. A Federal Reserve Bank was established in Kansas City, as well as 11 other major cities across the United States, to make sure the views of communities nationwide had a voice in Federal Reserve policy. The founders knew that such broad-based participation would lead to better decision making. This structure is replicated on the Federal Open Market Committee, which is the body that makes decisions about our nation's monetary policy through changes in an interest rate known as the federal funds rate, and, over the last couple of years, changes in the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet and the interest rate it pays on excess reserves. The FOMC is made up of 12 members: Seven of them are the Federal Reserve governors who have been appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Governors always have a vote at the FOMC. The other five members are presidents of the regional Federal Reserve Banks who are appointed by their local boards of directors. The New York Bank's president always has a vote, and the other 11 presidents share the remaining four votes in a set rotation. As a result, while all 12 Reserve Bank presidents are active participants in the FOMC debate, the seven politically appointed governors always have a majority of votes over the five voting Reserve Bank presidents. The regional Bank presidents fill a critical role at the Fed's policy table. They have the responsibility of representing their respective Federal Reserve Districts in providing their unique perspective on national policy issues. As dictated by the FOMC's structure, Washington and Wall Street not only participate in all discussions but have a permanent vote. Therefore, it is crucial to have independent voices at the table that regularly interact with Main Street business and community leaders in the rest of the country. In this structure, it is a key point to remember that each member was given a vote, not an advisory role. In FOMC policy votes since 1995 - which is essentially the current era of Fed policy - there was a dissenting vote about one-third of the time. Going back a bit earlier in the 1990s to the '90-91 recession, there were far more significant levels of dissent for both tighter and less restrictive monetary policy. During the Paul Volcker era, the chairman nearly lost one policy vote. In addition, there were 30 dissenting votes cast in Volcker's final 30 meetings as Fed chairman. There are, of course, commonalities between the end of the Volcker era, the 1990-91 recession and today: In each of these periods the economy was poised at a critical juncture and broad disagreement prevailed about the appropriate policy course - and not just around the Fed policy table. By the very nature of our political system, these were also periods of extreme political pressure to provide increased stimulus with an eye toward short-term gains and with a promise to take appropriate steps at some later point to remove that stimulus before inflationary pressures could become a problem. Leaving those issues aside, last year some suggested that dissenting votes confuse the market and that public disagreement among members reduced the effectiveness of Fed policy, including the second round of quantitative easing, known as QE2. As an economist, I cannot be certain that my views are correct. Certainly, a majority of my counterparts on the FOMC last year did not agree with my views. But it is important to recognize that in the face of uncertainty, arriving at the best policy decision is built on divergent opinions and vigorous debate. Because of this, the role of open dissent is at least as critical to FOMC monetary policy decisions as it is to deliberations by the Supreme Court, the United States Congress or any other body with important public responsibilities from the local through the federal level. If you find it unusual to consider the FOMC as being similar to these other deliberative bodies, it is perhaps because many-including some former Federal Reserve officials-tend to speak of Fed policy as being done by a single actor. In 2004, then-Fed Governor Ben Bernanke talked about this issue in a speech where he noted the ""diversity of views and opinions likely to exist among the members of a large committee create further challenges of effective communication."" Despite these challenges, he went on to talk about the importance of making these divergent views broadly known: ""Although at times it feels cacophonous, the willingness of FOMC members to present their individual perspectives in speeches and other public forums provides the public with useful information about the diversity of views and the balance of opinion on the Committee."" Some would suggest, of course, that monetary policy is not like a Supreme Court ruling. This line of reasoning comes from an idea that a unanimous FOMC is more likely to foster the confidence that is so critical to the functioning of our economy and financial system. To this line of thinking, dissent becomes even more dangerous in periods of high uncertainty. A deliberative body does not gain credibility by concealing dissent when decision making is most difficult. In fact, credibility is sacrificed as those on the outside realize that unanimity - difficult in any environment - simply may not be a reasonable expectation when the path ahead is the most confounding. The question then becomes: Should the debate that is happening privately remain hidden from the public eye until the meeting minutes or transcripts are later released? And in the interim, is the nation somehow better served by giving the public the impression that the entire body is in agreement to the prescribed approach even when that is not the case? In the mid-1980s, after the vote Chairman Volcker nearly lost created a bit of a media circus, Herbert Stein wrote a very interesting column about the issue for . Mr. Stein, who had been chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under two presidents, wrote that divergent views at the policy table should not be worrisome. It is more important, he wrote, that there are visible principles at work in shaping these views. Stein wrote that in creating the central bank of the United States, ""Congress intended diversity (of views) and the Federal Reserve ... benefits from the appearance that diversity is at least possible."" To suggest that public support is somehow encouraged by unanimous decisions suggests little appreciation for the public and their understanding about the challenges we face. To me, that fosters a loss of confidence that can be difficult to recover. As a result, the body becomes less able to respond to a crisis and is left more vulnerable to its critics. The Federal Reserve's founders recognized this a century ago. I hope we continue to recognize its critical importance in the years to come. As for me, I recognize that the committee's majority might be correct. In fact, I hope that it is. However, I have come to my policy position based on my experience, current data and economic history. If I had failed to express my views with my vote, I would have failed in my duty to you and to the committee.","['prospects', 'fed', 'interests', 'monetary', 'banks']","['business women', 'economic advisers', 'economic outlook', 'outlook economy', 'federal reserve']","['federal reserve colleagues', 'colleagues federal reserve', 'economic outlook 2011', 'views federal reserve', 'discussing monetary policy']","['federal reserve colleagues', 'business women', 'economic advisers', 'economic outlook', 'monetary policy stance']"
7669,r220719a_FOMC,united states,2022-07-19,Strengthening the CRA: A Conversation with Representatives of Native Communities,brainard,0,"Good afternoon. I am happy to join you today for the National Native Coalition listening session to discuss the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). I want to thank the National Congress of American Indians and its many tribal partners, as well as Casey Lozar and his team at the Center for Indian Country Development at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. I am pleased to be joined by Acting Comptroller of the Currency In May, the Federal Reserve, the OCC, and the FDIC issued a unified proposal to modernize the CRA regulations. This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to strengthen the CRA to bring greater credit, investment, and banking services to the communities that have faced the greatest challenges. For the first time, the CRA will provide powerful incentives for banks to make investments in communities that do not have access to branches, such as in Native lands. As representatives of Native communities, you know all too well the challenges faced by Native communities in getting access to financial services--challenges that were made worse by the pandemic. I have visited with Native communities in South Dakota and Oklahoma and seen firsthand the resiliency and innovation of these communities in the face of numerous challenges. Even with the implementation of the CRA and other complementary laws, tribal economic inclusion is hindered by a lack of banking and credit access. As of the most recent 2019 data, over 16 percent of Native  Americans are unbanked--three times higher than the rate for all U.S. households. part, the large share that is unbanked reflects low access to a bank branch. As of 2021, majority-Native American counties have an average of only two and a half bank branches--less than one-tenth the 26-branch overall average for all counties nationwide. Native small businesses often struggle to access capital: CRA small business and small farm lending per capita in majority-Native American census tracts is only about a quarter of that in majority-White-non-Hispanic tracts. As representatives of Native communities, you bring valuable insights to CRA reform because of your extensive knowledge of the investment and credit needs of Native communities, citizens, and businesses. The interagency CRA proposal was informed by consultation with Native representatives through roundtables, listening sessions, meetings, and comment letters. Indeed, we took much of your feedback from comment letters to develop the Native Land Areas sections of this proposal. As a result of this valuable feedback, the interagency CRA proposal would provide additional scope for bank loans, investments, and services in Native communities. Today, I want to focus on several aspects of the proposal that are beneficial for Native communities. First, the proposal provides greater incentives for community investments in Native Land Areas by providing enhanced clarity and specificity about what activities qualify for CRA credit. The proposed activities in Native Land Areas cover four specific place-based categories: revitalization; essential community facilities; essential  community infrastructure; and disaster preparedness and climate resiliency. The proposal also incorporates a new definition of Native Land Areas based on the political status and government recognition of tribes and tribal areas that would enable the qualification of place-based activities in Native Land Areas. The proposal also provides clarity for Native community development financial Native CDFIs and MDIs are critical players in supporting credit access and investment in Native communities, the proposal provides additional certainty that activities with Treasury-certified CDFIs will qualify for CRA consideration and provides greater clarity to banks on receiving credit for activities with MDIs. The agencies also propose maintaining a publicly available illustrative list of eligible community development activities, which provides an opportunity to highlight qualifying activities particularly responsive to the needs of Native communities. In another important change, the proposal would result in greater CRA activity outside of where banks have branches and physical locations in order to address unmet needs in communities that have more limited access to bank branches. To this end, we also propose evaluating the impact and responsiveness of a bank's community development activities through a series of specific qualitative factors, with activities benefitting Native communities as one of those specific factors. In addition, now that many banks conduct significant lending and investments outside of their branch networks, it is important to ensure CRA accounts for these different business models. For example, we propose establishing retail lending  assessment areas where a large bank has a concentration of either 100 mortgage loans or 250 small business loans for two years in a row. Finally, the proposal would continue to emphasize a bank's performance in the local communities where it maintains branches, regardless of their performance in other areas. In addition to assessing a large bank's retail lending and community development activities in each facility-based assessment area, we also propose to evaluate whether banks have branches in low-income and moderate-income census tracts. In particular, the agencies propose providing positive qualitative consideration if banks operate branches In closing, your feedback is key to ensuring that we get CRA reform right. I strongly encourage you to submit a comment letter by the August 5th deadline. We look forward to reading each comment letter and deeply appreciate your insight and participation with us through the rulemaking process. Thank you.","['banks', 'tribes', 'banking', 'bank', 'tribal']","['financial native', 'bank community', 'native communities', 'native coalition', 'native community']","['investment native communities', 'development financial native', 'community investments native', 'native communities proposal', 'benefitting native communities']","['native community development', 'native communities', 'tribal economic inclusion', 'community reinvestment act', 'native small businesses']"
6125,r220719a_BOE,united kingdom,2022-07-19,"Bringing inflation back to the 2% target, no ifs no buts",bailey,1,"Lord Mayor, it is a great pleasure to be here at Mansion House this evening. The return to more normal times allows those of us from the Bank to pop round to our neighbour for an informal light dinner. It is also pleasing that you have been able to resume travelling in pursuit of your important role of promoting the UK and in particular the services of the City. We thank you for that important work. Quite appropriately you have also been keen to ensure that there is a suitable number of events to mark your Irish roots, the strong connections between the City and Ireland, and the rich vein of form of the Irish rugby team. I would like to join you [and the Chancellor] in welcoming Paschal Donohoe. It's always good to see you Paschal. Chancellor, congratulations on taking up the office. I know from a lot of experience that you will find a warm welcome in the City. In my experience, you will find that people in the City want to get things done. I have been involved in attending or speechwriting for this dinner for 25 years, and I well remember in the early days that the speeches of Lord Mayors featured each year a plea to get Crossrail agreed, started, finished. Well finally, Lord Mayor, you can notch that one up. Now, ""getting stuff done"" is not a lead in to a speech on reforming Solvency 2. I can hear the murmur of relief going round. Instead I am going to talk about the economy and monetary policy. I think I just heard someone say, can we have Solvency 2 for light relief please. Fair point, but no. A member of the public sent me an email recently, in which she said that she appreciated what I am doing, but can I please, please, please be more cheerful. I should say that I do seek earnestly to avoid the role of Private Frazer in Dad's Army - we are not doomed, far from it. But we are in difficult times. From the perspective of monetary policy, these times are the largest challenge to the monetary policy regime of inflation targeting that we have seen in the quarter century since the MPC was created in 1997. That emphatically does not mean the regime has failed. Far from it. The regime was set up for times exactly like these. The regime, founded on central bank independence, is now more important than ever. The worth of any regime is tested in the difficult, not the nice, times. To illustrate that, let me quote part of the then Governor Eddie George's speech given at Mansion House in 1997, a month after the MPC came into being: ""The technical implementation of monetary policy is not at all an exact science. It operates with long and unpredictable time lags so that we are necessarily continuously straining to peer into the future, relying substantially upon uncertain economic forecasts and carefully considered, but ultimately subjective judgements about the probabilities - and of risks - surrounding them. So I welcome the Chancellor's detailed reformulation of our marching orders, which acknowledges the volatility of the real world."" Wise words, which are more relevant than ever today. In the same spirit, I want to spend the rest of my time tonight setting out the judgements we are having to make now, in a real world which is certainly volatile. But I will start with one statement that doesn't change whatever the circumstances: our job is to hit the inflation target, and in the current circumstances to return inflation to target, always remembering the importance of understanding time lags in policy, and lags in the impact of economic shocks. Let me be quite clear, there are no ifs or buts in our commitment to the 2% inflation target. That's our job, and that's what we will do. When it comes to judgements we have to make, it is important to understand the disturbances hitting the economy and their significance for monetary policy. We have seen an almost unprecedented series of such disturbances - unprecedented certainly in modern times. I am going to pick out four which have been at work in the last two and a half years and discuss them in broadly chronological order. I will start with the onset of Covid over two years ago now and its subsequent waves. It is worth briefly recalling the precipitous drop in economic activity at that time, and the speculation that it would be the largest drop in three hundred years. In the end it was very big, but not quite that big. It required a very large response from macroeconomic policy. Monetary and fiscal policy both acted to counter the cyclical downturn, reinforcing one another even as they were implemented independently. Moreover, the response had to be sustained because of the sheer scale of the uncertainty around the impact of further waves of Covid. It is worth recalling that the key aim of policy was to support businesses and households through the crisis, limiting lasting damage to the economy - which could have been compromised by a premature withdrawal of stimulus. Without that policy support, the economy today would be in a much worse position. Moreover, policy is necessarily made in real time, not in hindsight. Remember that we started with no functioning vaccine and the previous average time to implement one for viruses of this nature was 10 years. The second disturbance came with the recovery from Covid. It was the first of the three big supply disturbances of the last year or so. Let me start by putting it into context. UK GDP recovered quite rapidly from the precipitous drop of the initial Covid period, but it did not soar away. That's very different to the pattern of the US economy for instance. Put another way, in the UK we have had two years with very little growth overall. The story of the recovery from Covid in terms of inflation had a global dimension. In many advanced economies, the pattern of demand shifted from services to goods, most notably in the US. These goods are much more traded than services, and this put pressure on global supply chains. That pressure was further affected by issues in China with the so-called zero Covid policy, and the impact this had on traded goods prices. The third disturbance has been caused by the actions of Russia in the build up to and subsequent illegal invasion of Ukraine. This is now the largest shock - concentrated in energy and some food prices. It is hitting the least well off hardest because they, necessarily, spend more of their income on essentials, notably food and energy. Recently some of the most outrageous nonsense I have ever heard has been spouted by the Russians, namely that the current global economic problems are caused by sanctions against Russia, not by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This is utter rubbish. We cannot accept this assault on democratic systems and values and on the security of the European continent. Economic prosperity is, and will continue to be, built on the foundations of democracy and security. These values are the bedrock of open economies and financial systems, and Russia has betrayed them. The Russian shock is now the largest contributor to UK inflation by some way. There is an economic cost to the war, and we all have to recognise that, but at the Bank it will not deflect us from setting monetary policy to bring inflation back to the 2% target. The last disturbance is a domestic one. The UK labour force has shrunk over the last two years, and this is contributing to inflationary pressure due to the difficulty of recruiting. It is important to understand exactly why the labour force has shrunk, why inactivity - those not working and not seeking to - has risen, and of course what we might expect to see in the future. Have more people retired than was expected, has long-term illness risen permanently, and how many people may return to the labour force and over what time? A one percentage point reduction in the labour force may not sound much, but with a working-age population of around 40 million it is a lot of people. With such numbers, the shrinkage in the labour market adds an inflationary impulse on top of energy and international goods prices. And central to the assessment of the outlook for monetary policy, it increases the risk that the inflation that has come to us from abroad gets embedded in more persistent domestic inflationary pressures. Let me draw all of this together, and pull out the implications for monetary policy. The big external shocks - from Russia and supply chains - account both for a large part of the inflation overshoot above target and for the squeeze on real incomes. My sense of the latest data is that the supply chain/goods shock has started to ease, but the Russian impact - particularly on natural gas prices in Europe is going the other way as we look ahead to the winter. The effect of these shocks has been to increase the cost of things we import relative to things we produce domestically. This is a very large shock to our national real income. I think we can already see the effects, with the economy slowing (I would urge caution in interpreting the May GDP number as strong - given the changed pattern of public holidays). Monetary policy has to be set taking into account the scale of this shock to real income, while keeping our focus on inflation and inflation expectations. Returning inflation to its 2% target sustainably remains our absolute priority. But we recognise a trade-off in a situation of high inflation and weakening growth. In my view this trade-off explains why we have raised Bank Rate progressively since last December in increments of 0.25% after the first rise. We have judged what we need to do in the face of these very big external shocks which, assuming Bank Rate following the market path used for the May MPR forecast, will see inflation fall very rapidly next year, and return to target in 2023, and then go below target. But other things may not be equal, and we have been clear that we see the balance of risks to inflation as on the upside. Here, I would pick out the risks from domestic price and wage setting, and this explains why at the MPC's last meeting we adopted language which made clear that if we see signs of greater persistence of inflation, and price and wage setting would be such signs, we will have to act forcefully. In simple terms this means that a 50 basis point increase will be among the choices on the table when we next meet. 50 basis points is not locked in, and anyone who predicts that is doing so based on their own view. We do not pre-announce Bank Rate decisions for the very simple reason that MPC decisions are based on deliberation at the time among nine people focused on returning inflation to the 2% target sustainably. At its next meeting, it is also time for the MPC to discuss the strategy for beginning to sell the gilts held in our Asset Purchase Facility portfolio. We will publish, alongside the Monetary Policy Report, more detail on how we will do this, to allow financial market participants to make the necessary preparations. This will ensure we have the option to commence a sales programme shortly after a confirmatory vote by the MPC, which could be as early as at our September meeting. Based on analysis conducted in conjunction with colleagues at the DMO, we are currently looking at a total reduction in the stock of gilts held by the APF, which covers both sales and gilt redemptions, of something in the region of PS50-100bn in the first year. Our Market Intelligence suggests that's broadly in line with what market participants are expecting. Let me end by going back to the plea that I be more cheerful. Lord Mayor, let me tell you about one thing that has made me most proud as Governor this year. Recently, the Governor of the National Bank of Ukraine, asked me if we had any spare armoured vehicles. He wanted to use them to support cash distribution around Ukraine. It so happened that we have stopped using our own transportation to move bank notes around this country, and our fleet of three vehicles was due to be taken out of service. Our staff immediately set about getting them ready, drove them to the Polish-Ukrainian border and handed them over. That made me very proud. Thank you.","['irish', 'welcoming', 'ireland', 'mayor', 'mayors']","['form irish', 'city ireland', 'lord mayors', 'lord mayor', 'chancellor welcoming']","['speeches lord mayors', 'events mark irish', 'form irish rugby', 'join chancellor welcoming', 'finally lord mayor']","['lord mayors', 'lord mayor', 'irish rugby team', 'ireland', 'irish roots']"
6126,r220720a_BOE,united kingdom,2022-07-20,New tides,benjamin,0,"International banks active in the UK: 2022 priorities international banks active in the United Kingdom . These priorities are intended to complement our ongoing supervision and the feedback you will have received following the most recent Periodic Summary Meeting (PSM) for your firm. These are sent to the wide and diverse range of international banks that we supervise; therefore this list is not exhaustive, but is intended to provide a helpful overview of our priorities for 2022. As economies continue to be impacted by Covid-19, the resilience of the financial sector remains paramount to ensure that the financial system can continue to support businesses and households. The banking sector remains resilient to outcomes for the economy that are much more severe than the but risks to the recovery remain. It is important that firms take proactive steps to assess the challenges of a changing economic environment. Many firms' earnings have benefited from the accommodative macro environment and supportive government measures in the past year. As this environment evolves, firms will need to assess the implications for the sustainability of their business models. This will be particularly important for those firms that have lost market share as certain sectors have become markedly more concentrated during the pandemic. The economic recovery is likely to be uneven across sectors, so firms will need to closely monitor credit risk and traded risk within their portfolios, particularly as official sector support schemes are withdrawn . Alongside these cyclical issues, broader structural changes - such as an acceleration of digitalisation in the banking sector - could amplify challenges faced by individual firms as they recover from the impact of Covid-19. We will continue to engage with firms to assess the challenges these changes bring to the sustainability of business models. The default of Archegos Capital Management last year also brought to light deficiencies in banks' risk management governance and frameworks, many of which were symptoms of a broader root cause and manifestations of an inappropriate internal risk culture where lessons from the global financial crisis had not been sufficiently learnt. This event further reinforced the need for firms to consider concentrated and leveraged exposures and to improve counterparty risk management. Assessing the risk culture and the incentives structures in place at firms, and the alignment of remuneration with risk management practices, will be a key priority of our supervisory work with firms engaged in equity finance and the broader prime brokerage business. In addition, the cross-border nature of this event highlighted the importance of global regulatory cooperation , a theme that will continue into 2022. 2. Operational risk and resilience Enhancing the operational resilience of the financial sector remains a strategic priority for the PRA. Covid19 continues to reinforce the importance of the firms' ability to prevent, adapt, respond to, recover, and learn from operational disruptions. We will continue to assess firms' progress in developing dynamic, effective operational risk and control frameworks to manage the threat of operational disruptions. We expect firms to develop their security controls and capabilities to manage the increasing risk of cyber We encourage all firms, regardless of size, to test their resilience against such threats. By Thursday 31 March 2022, firms must have identified and mapped their important business services; set impact tolerances for these; and initiated a programme of scenario testing. Impact tolerances provide a standard which boards and senior management should use for prioritising investment, and making recovery and response arrangements. We will continue to review firms' programmes and their implementation. SS1/21 applies to subsidiaries, but we also expect third country branches in the UK to be able to demonstrate how they will deliver operationally-resilient outcomes. We will look to work with firms and with their home state supervisors to understand how they will deliver these outcomes. We also introduced new expectations on outsourcing and third party risk management (as set out in to strengthen our expectations on operational resilience, and to facilitate greater resilience of services provided by third parties, including the cloud and other technologies. We have observed a material increase in the services being outsourced, particularly to cloud providers, and we expect firms to manage the risk arising from this accordingly. Under SS2/21, firms should maintain an updated register of their outsourcing arrangements. Firms should also ensure their important business services can remain within impact tolerances even when they rely on outsourcing or on third party providers. 3. Financial risks arising from climate change Climate change presents a material and increasing financial risk to firms and to the financial system. Managing the risks to firms' safety and soundness from climate change requires action now, and remains a key PRA priority. Some firms have made good progress in embedding the PRA's supervisory , but progress has not been consistent across all firms, with further work required by many to meet those expectations. We have observed that most firms are focused on the business opportunities presented by climate change, and remind firms that climate change also presents an increasing business risk that is foreseeable and requires action now. We expect firms to take a forward-looking, strategic and ambitious approach to managing climate-related financial risks. This approach should be proportionate to the scale of the risks and the complexity of a firm's operations. From 2022, we will incorporate supervision of climate-related financial risks into our core supervisory approach. The assessment of a firm's management of climate-related financial risks will be included in all relevant elements of the supervisory cycle, as outlined in our recently published Climate As our collective understanding of climate-related risks, data, tools, and best practice evolves, we expect firms to refine and innovate to better integrate climate-related financial risk management across their organisation. The PRA will pay particular attention to how firms quantify climaterelated risks and incorporate those risks into business strategies, decision-making, and risk-taking. Furthermore, we will keep a range of supervisory tools under review for use where we deem progress to be insufficient. Although the expectations in SS3/19 apply to UK-incorporated firms, it is important that branches of international firms also focus on climate change, which we see as a vital element of sound risk management. We will continue to increase our engagement with home state supervisors on this issue. set out our ambition to support the resilience of the financial services sector by encouraging diversity within firms. We see a clear link to our objectives: diversity helps bring a mix of views, perspectives and experiences within firms. An inclusive culture where staff can freely raise concerns and participate appropriately in decision-making, can reduce the risk of groupthink, encourage debate and innovation, and support the safety and soundness of firms. We have received positive feedback from industry on the proposals in the Discussion Paper. While we recognise that change takes time, we expect firms to consider the themes set out in the Discussion Paper and challenge themselves to understand their gaps and consider where they can make progress. 5. Risk-free rate transition Although a major milestone in the transition to risk-free rates was reached at the end of 2021, we expect firms to continue making best efforts to actively transition LIBOR-referencing contracts wherever possible. Together with the Financial Conduct Authority, we will be closely monitoring actions to remove any remaining dependencies on LIBOR, including synthetic LIBOR. We also expect firms to use the most robust alternative reference rates to LIBOR - any firm considering the use of credit-sensitive rates should assess the risks carefully and raise this with their supervisors before doing so. Other areas of supervisory focus Data is an increasing area of focus at firms and at the PRA. We are investing to deliver a world-class regtech and data strategy, for which it is essential that we have accurate information. We recognise the efforts made by firms to improve complete, timely and accurate regulatory returns and we expect firms to maintain efforts in this regard, moving from tactical to strategic solutions, while managing supplier and project risks to achieve material benefits for data quality, flexibility, and information security. The submission of complete, timely, and accurate regulatory returns continues to be the foundation of effective supervision, so the PRA expects all firms to continue to take action to ensure the integrity of their returns. The PRA is expanding its programme of using skilled persons reviews (under Section 166 of the Financial Services and Markets Act) to verify the accuracy of regulatory returns, which will continue in 2022. In the longer term, joint industry-Bank of England work on transforming data collection creates the opportunity for better quality reporting at lower cost, and we encourage firms to engage with this initiative. This letter in conjunction with your firm's PSM letter should convey a sense of our planned work for next year. We will continue to work closely with our international supervisory colleagues on these workstreams. We look forward to working with you over the coming year.

3996,r220728a_BOJ,japan,2022-07-28,Japan's Economy and Monetary Policy,amamiya,0,"It is my pleasure to have the opportunity today to exchange views with leaders in administrative, financial, and economic areas in Iwate Prefecture. I would like to take this chance to express my sincere gratitude for your cooperation with the activities of the Bank projections for Japan's economic activity and prices through fiscal 2024 and released them in the latest like to talk about the Bank's view on Japan's economic activity and prices based on the Outlook Report and explain its thinking on the conduct of monetary policy. I will start by talking about the current state of Japan's economy. While the economy had continued to swing up and down for a prolonged period, depending on the situation with the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), it has been picking up since spring this year with the impact of COVID-19 waning. Looking at developments in the household sector, the COVID-19 pandemic has exerted downward pressure on consumption activity that involves close contact with others and physical visits to places, particularly face-to-face services consumption, such as dining-out and travel (Chart 1). Due to the spread of the Omicron variant, private consumption for the January-March quarter of 2022 was somewhat weak, mainly for services. However, since the lifting in late March of the priority measures to prevent the spread of disease, a recovery in private consumption has become evident along with an increase in the number of people going out. In fact, sales in the food services industry have been approaching pre-pandemic levels on the whole, although weakness has remained in demand for large group meetings and afterparties, for example. In addition, based on various sources, such as anecdotal information that the Bank obtained from firms, domestic travel at the start of the summer holiday season appears to have been steady, partly due to the effects of travel and accommodation discounts provided by the local governments that have been aimed at local residents. However, the recent increase in the number of COVID-19 cases is concerning, especially because its pace is extremely rapid. In addition, rises in prices of such items as energy and food have led to deterioration in consumer sentiment, and developments associated with these rises warrant due attention. Turning to developments in the corporate sector, firms' production activity has been under strong downward pressure due to global supply-side constraints, and the impact of this has spread not only to exports but also to domestic business fixed investment and consumption of durable goods (Chart 2). The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a major shift in demand from services to goods on a global basis and has brought about a rapid expansion in digital-related demand and a resultant semiconductor shortage, partly through widespread adoption of online conferences and working from home. In this situation, there have been successive suspensions of operations at factories as a result of pandemic-related restrictions around the world, and the effects of supply-side constraints therefore have become more prolonged than initially expected. With the addition of the impact of disruptions in distribution networks due to lockdowns in Shanghai, there have been difficulties in procuring parts recently, and the level of Japan's production has declined clearly, mainly for automobile-related goods. In this situation, exports have remained on an uptrend, supported by a recovery in overseas economies, but they have seen a halt in their improvement recently due to the effects of supply-side constraints. Regarding consumption of durable goods, automobile sales have been at low levels due to strong supply-side constraints, and the lead time from purchase of automobiles to delivery appears to have become longer. Based on various sources such as anecdotal information from firms, the impact of lockdowns in China seems to have waned gradually, but developments warrant attention as the number of COVID-19 cases in the country has been increasing again amid the Chinese government maintaining the so-called zero-COVID policy. In sum, with the impact of COVID-19 waning, Japan's economy has finally started to show positive signs, especially in the services sector. However, due to the supply-side constraints I just mentioned, production activity in the manufacturing industry has been pushed down. These developments were reflected in the June 2022 of Enterprises in Japan), which shows that business sentiment for the nonmanufacturing industry has improved, whereas that for the manufacturing industry has deteriorated. The outlook for Japan's economy is that, although it is expected to be under downward pressure stemming from high commodity prices due to factors such as the situation surrounding Ukraine, it is likely to recover with the impact of COVID-19 waning and supply-side constraints dissipating. To explain this outlook in some detail, let me first focus on the household sector (Chart 3). Due mainly to restrictions and self-restraint during the pandemic, private consumption became notably subdued relative to income. However, it has increased moderately, mainly for services consumption such as dining-out and travel, with the impact of COVID-19 waning. Regarding the outlook, although private consumption is expected to be under downward pressure due to price rises, it is projected to keep increasing because savings that have accumulated to date are expected to provide support and because pent-up demand, i.e., demand that had been held back under pandemic-related restrictions, is likely to materialize. Meanwhile, employee income has improved moderately, reflecting rises in the number of employees and wages associated with a recovery in economic activity. Such improvement in employee income is projected to continue; supported by this, private consumption is expected to keep increasing steadily from fiscal 2023 onward, although the pace of materialization of pent-up demand is likely to slow. I will now turn to the corporate sector (Chart 4). Exports are likely to increase, mainly for automobile- and digital-related goods, as overseas economies continue recovering and as supply-side constraints dissipate. With regard to corporate profits, the show that current profits have marked a new record high for fiscal 2021. Although raw material cost increases are projected to exert downward pressure, corporate profits are likely to be at high levels on the whole, albeit with variation across industries and firm sizes, on the back of an increase in domestic and external demand and partly also of the effects of the yen's depreciation. In this situation, an uptrend in business fixed investment is expected to become clear as accommodative financial conditions provide support and supply-side constraints wane. In fact, the business fixed investment plan for fiscal 2022 in the June 2022 indicates that investment is projected to increase more firmly than usual. It is expected that firms will take an increasingly active stance not only toward labor-saving investment to address labor shortage but also toward other business fixed investment, including for research and development in areas such as digitalization and decarbonization. In terms of the medians of the Policy Board members' forecasts, Japan's real GDP growth rate is expected to be at 2.4 percent for fiscal 2022, 2.0 percent for fiscal 2023, and 1.3 percent for fiscal 2024 (Chart 5). As Japan's recent potential growth rate is estimated to be in the range of 0.0-0.5 percent, the forecasts show that the economy is projected to continue growing at a pace above its potential growth rate for four consecutive years when including fiscal 2021. The level of GDP is expected to recover to the pre-pandemic level (the 2019 average) around the second half of this fiscal year. However, the pace of recovery has been slower than in Europe and the United States, a topic to which I will return later. Risks to the Outlook There are extremely high uncertainties over the outlook, and risks to economic activity are skewed to the downside for the time being. I am paying particular attention to the following two risk factors. The first is the sustainability of a rise in private consumption. As mentioned earlier, private consumption for the time being is expected to be under downward pressure from the real income side but is projected to increase, supported by pent-up demand. That said, since pent-up demand is expected to materialize in services consumption in particular, including dining-out and travel, developments in such demand depend largely on the future course of COVID-19. Moreover, pent-up demand by its nature wanes gradually. Thus, for a sustained increase in private consumption, it is essential that wages rise. In this regard, if, for example, prices of commodities, including grains, remain high for a prolonged period amid high uncertainties over the situation surrounding Ukraine, wage increases will not sufficiently catch up with overall price rises and Japan's economy could be pushed down, particularly for private consumption. The second factor is overseas economic activity and prices (Chart 6). Looking at the latest released by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the projected growth rates of the global economy have been revised downward from the projections made in April. This is due to the impact of the situation surrounding Ukraine, lockdowns in China, and central banks' shift toward monetary tightening in response to rising inflation around the world. It should be noted, however, that the latest WEO forecasts show that global economic growth will remain positive at around 3 percent for both 2022 and 2023, indicating that the global economy is not expected to fall into recession. That said, there is concern in global financial and capital markets over whether it is possible to contain inflation and maintain economic growth simultaneously. Under these circumstances, there is a risk that global financial conditions will tighten further through adjustments in asset prices, fluctuations in foreign exchange markets, and capital outflows from emerging economies, and that this will eventually push down overseas economies. The Bank considers it necessary to continue to pay due attention to developments in financial and foreign exchange markets and their impact on Japan's economic activity and prices. Next, let me talk about price developments. The year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI) for all items excluding fresh food has been at around 2 percent since April, when much of the impact of last year's reduction in mobile phone charges dissipated (Chart 7). The main cause of recent price increases is rises in energy prices, such as gasoline and kerosene prices and electricity charges, and in food prices. In this regard, for June, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI excluding fresh food and energy was 1.0 percent and that excluding energy and food was 0.2 percent. Comparing price developments in Japan with those abroad, the year-on-year rates of change in consumer prices for all items have been at 9.1 percent in the United States, the highest rate in about 40 years, and at 8.6 percent in the euro area, the highest since recordkeeping began in 1997. This shows that both regions are experiencing elevated inflation and that Japan's inflation rate has remained comparatively low. It should be noted, however, that the rate in Japan has risen gradually. In fact, this April was the first time that Japan's CPI inflation rate exceeded 2 percent since 2008. Looking at developments behind price rises in Japan, import prices have increased due to a global rise in prices of commodities, including grains, and to the yen's depreciation. In addition, under these circumstances, firms have been increasingly passing on cost increases to selling prices, partly due to the impact of product shortages caused by prolonged supply-side constraints. Thus, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI for all items excluding fresh food is likely to increase toward the end of this year due to rises in prices of such items as energy, food, and durable goods, and the average for fiscal 2022 is expected to exceed 2 percent, at 2.3 percent. However, unless we assume that prices of commodities such as crude oil will continue rising in the future, it is projected from the beginning of 2023 that the positive contribution of the rise in energy prices to the CPI will wane and the pass-through of cost increases will weaken gradually. As a result, the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI for all items excluding fresh food is expected to decelerate from fiscal 2022 to 1.4 percent for fiscal 2023 and 1.3 percent for fiscal 2024. In terms of inflation that also excludes energy, for which prices see significant short-term fluctuations, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase moderately in positive territory on the back of improvement in the output gap, rises in medium- to long-term inflation expectations, and in wage growth. That said, even in fiscal 2024, which is the end of the projection period, the rate of increase is expected to only be at around 1.5 percent. In sum, achievement of the price stability target of 2 percent in a sustainable and stable manner is not yet envisaged at this point. Let me now talk about the Bank's conduct of monetary policy. The Bank conducts monetary policy with the aim of achieving the price stability target in a sustainable and stable manner. Achieving the price stability target does not mean that the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI temporarily reaches 2 percent due to an exogenous increase in import prices such as energy, but rather that the rate registers 2 percent on average over the business cycle. From this perspective, it is necessary to examine the sustainability of price increases by comprehensively assessing the outlook for prices, as well as the underlying output gap, medium- to long-term inflation expectations, and wage developments, in addition to various measures of core inflation, which exclude temporary fluctuations. What is important is to achieve a virtuous cycle where wages and prices rise simultaneously and people's living standards improve amid continued growth in the economy. In this regard, Japan's economy is still on its way to recovery from the downturn caused by COVID-19. In fact, unlike the United States and the euro area, Japan's GDP has not yet recovered to the pre-pandemic level (Chart 8). Furthermore, as Japan relies on imports for most commodities, the recent high commodity prices associated with the situation surrounding Ukraine and other factors have exerted downward pressure on the economy in the form of an outflow of income from Japan. The value of commodity imports for the April-June quarter increased by slightly less than 4 trillion yen from the quarterly average of the previous fiscal year. This means an additional income outflow of about 2 to 3 percent of GDP. Thus, the foundation for Japan's economy to recover is not yet firm, and with high uncertainties surrounding wage developments, it is necessary to support economic activity through monetary easing. Based on this recognition, at the MPM held last week, the Bank decided to maintain its aggressive monetary easing stance under the monetary policy framework of yield curve control. With this framework, Japan's long-term interest rates have remained at extremely low levels, even amid strong upward pressure from abroad on the interest rates. Since Japan's nominal long-term interest rates have remained low while people's inflation expectations have risen, real interest rates, calculated by subtracting inflation expectations from nominal interest rates, appear to have declined recently (Chart 9). Although it should be noted that real interest rates can take various values depending on the combination of the maturity of nominal interest rates and the type of inflation expectations used for their calculation, short- to medium-term real interest rates have generally been on a downtrend, and the effects of monetary easing are considered to have been greater than before. Nevertheless, given that achievement of the price stability target of 2 percent in a sustainable and stable manner is not yet envisaged, as shown in the latest Outlook Report, and that there are high uncertainties surrounding wage developments, it is necessary for the Bank to continue with monetary easing steadfastly. Next, I would like to share the Bank's views on future wage developments, which are the key to achieving the price stability target. As I mentioned earlier, for the time being, savings that have accumulated as a result of pandemic-related restrictions and pent-up demand will serve as a buffer to prevent private consumption from stalling. However, for such consumption to see a sustained expansion even after pent-up demand runs out, nominal wages need to rise at a higher rate than the inflation rate. In this regard, for the current fiscal year, this spring's base pay increase is expected to be reflected in scheduled cash earnings of full-time employees, and summer bonuses are also likely to increase, mainly for the manufacturing industry, on the back of high corporate profits (Chart 10). In addition, wages of non-regular employees, many of whom work in the face-to-face services sector, are also projected to gradually show a clear upward trend, supported mainly by the materialization of pent-up demand in dining-out and travel. Thus, wages are expected to rise for this fiscal year. That said, their growth is not projected to exceed CPI inflation. It is worth mentioning that further increases in wages, including base pay, can be expected from the next fiscal year onward, as labor market conditions are likely to tighten on the back of improvement in the economy and the increased rate of inflation is expected to be taken into account in labor-management wage negotiations. Under these circumstances, together with a decline in the inflation rate, wage growth is projected to exceed CPI inflation. In general, wage formation is affected by a variety of factors, including labor productivity, growth expectations, labor union bargaining power, and minimum wages. Monetary policy, as a macroeconomic policy, also has an impact on such formation through its influence on such factors as labor market conditions. Specifically, the Bank's monetary easing will first support positive spending activity of firms and households and boost aggregate demand through accommodative financial conditions such as lower funding costs. This will lead to an increase in corporate profits and, through higher corporate demand for labor, bring about a tightening of labor market conditions, which in turn will contribute to wage increases. The Bank will continue to firmly support economic activity through monetary easing, aiming to achieve the price stability target, accompanied by wage increases, in a sustainable and stable manner. Lastly, I would like to talk about the economy of Iwate Prefecture. The Bank assesses that the prefecture's economy has picked up moderately. As with nationwide developments, although Iwate Prefecture's production has seen a halt in its pick-up -- mainly due to the effects of supply-side constraints -- private consumption, especially services consumption, has improved with the impact of such factors as Looking at developments in tourism in particular, Iwate Prefecture is blessed with a wealth of appealing tourism resources, such as the Goshono Site, which -- as one of the Jomon Prehistoric Sites in Northern Japan -- was registered as a World Heritage Site in July last year. Moreover, four days from now, the Morioka Sansa Odori Festival, which unfortunately had been canceled previously due to the pandemic, will be held for the first time in three years. Expectations are growing for further improvement in services consumption. Eleven years have passed since the unprecedented disaster of the Great East Japan Earthquake. During that time, Iwate Prefecture's residents, businesses, and local administrations have worked hand-in-hand on reconstruction. I visited disaster-stricken areas during my stay in Iwate Prefecture and witnessed efforts to pass along the experiences and lessons learned from the disaster to future generations. It is encouraging to see the steady progress in building up the social infrastructure, including the network of ""reconstruction roads,"" such as the Sanriku coastal road, and ""reconstruction support roads."" At the same time, I also felt keenly once again how tough it is to rebuild after a disaster. Iwate Prefecture faces the task of maintaining the vitality of the regional economy while addressing the crucial challenges of a rapidly declining population, a falling birth rate and aging population, and climate change. To meet this task, I think it is inevitable that the prefecture will devise ways of capturing demand not only from within the region but from throughout the country and the world. From this point of view, I am paying attention to two promising developments in the prefecture. The first is the accumulation of automobile- and semiconductor-related manufacturing industries in the southern part of the prefecture, which has come about through efforts to attract production facilities there. This reflects in part a positive assessment of better transportation access in the region, the benefits of risk diversification, and the success of public-private actions to attract businesses. I think this accumulation of manufacturing industries will also further encourage firms' recent moves to bring supply chains back to The other development is the progress being made with digitalization to revitalize the prefecture's economy, with a view to the post-pandemic era. I am given to understand that a joint committee has been set up to promote digital transformation in Iwate Prefecture, and under its direction, industry, academia, government agencies, and financial institutions all across the prefecture are collaborating in multifaceted efforts, such as addressing regional challenges, boosting firms' productivity, and dealing with labor shortages. I believe these actions will be crucial to resolving the issues facing the region. Let me conclude by expressing my sincere hope that Iwate Prefecture, which is pursuing reconstruction and transformation, will achieve further revitalization of the regional economy through these efforts. Thank you very much for your attention.","['economy', 'fiscal', 'consumption', 'economic', 'yen']","['japan economy', 'japan economic', 'japan inflation', 'inflation japan', 'japan gdp']","['japan economy finally', 'japan economy way', 'impact japan economic', 'japan economic activity', 'outlook japan economy']","['monetary policy', 'monetary policy framework', 'economic activity', 'positive spending activity', 'global financial conditions']"
7670,r220806a_FOMC,united states,2022-08-06,Fighting Inflation in Challenging Times,bowman,0,"Thanks to the Kansas Bankers Association for the invitation to share my perspective on the economy and bank regulation. It is always a pleasure to be here with you for this annual gathering. I am especially looking forward to hearing what is on your minds about supervision and regulation, how you are navigating current economic conditions, and your expectations going forward. I'll start with a recap of the decision from July's Federal Open Market Committee meeting and then move on to my thoughts about the current economic uncertainty and challenges that lie ahead. The number one challenge, of course, is inflation, which continues to be much too high, and a heavy burden for households and businesses. As I'm sure you all already know, the Federal Open Market Committee decided last week to raise the federal funds rate by 75 basis points, to a range of 2 1/4 to 2 1/2 percent. I will share my reasoning for supporting this increase and why I support continued increases until inflation is on a consistent path to significantly decline. I will then touch on the current federal regulatory climate and the Fed's agenda for supervision. Inflation continued to climb in June, reaching 9.1 percent as measured by the consumer price index. This is yet another concerningly high reading, and it set another 40-year record high despite the expectation of many forecasters that inflation had peaked earlier in the year. I have seen few, if any, concrete indications that support this expectation, and I will need to see unambiguous evidence of this decline before I incorporate an easing of inflation pressures into my outlook. Many of the underlying causes of excessive inflation are the same as they have been over the past year or so--supply chain issues, including those related to China's  COVID containment policies, constrained housing supply, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, fiscal stimulus, and limitations on domestic energy production. Regardless of the source of the inflationary pressure, the Federal Reserve has a duty to bring inflation down to our 2 percent target. This duty is mandated by Congress to carry out monetary policy that results in price stability--meaning low and stable inflation. We all understand why this is a critically important responsibility, especially in times of extreme inflation. Rising prices for food, housing, and energy negatively impact affordability for all Americans, but especially those with low or moderate incomes. For those workers who drive long distances to get to work, high inflation is especially concerning, requiring some to make tradeoffs between feeding their families and buying fuel to fill gas tanks. Some workers have seen their wages grow significantly over the past two years, but most have seen any gains in wages far outpaced by higher prices. Therefore, in my mind, it is absolutely critical that we continue to use our monetary policy tools until we are successful in returning inflation to our 2 percent goal. Businesses are also suffering from elevated inflation through rising and volatile prices for inputs and the need to price their own goods and services to cover costs without losing customers. This dynamic is evident in agriculture and what we are hearing directly from farmers and ranchers, who are dealing with added weather challenges and on-going drought. Prices for commodities have declined lately but are still at historically high levels. In contrast, prices for fertilizer and many crop inputs continue to rise. In some areas, high input costs and drought conditions are contributing to record early season cattle auction sales, as many ranchers choose to sell herds early to limit further outlays for input expenses.  I see a significant risk of high inflation into next year for necessities including food, housing, fuel, and vehicles. Rents have grown dramatically, and while home sales have slowed, the continued increasing price of single-family homes indicates to me that rents won't decline anytime in the near future. Recently, gasoline prices have moderated but are still roughly 80 percent higher than pre-pandemic levels due to constrained domestic supply and the disruption of world markets. And I see continued inflation risk from motor vehicle prices, as auto manufacturers struggle with supply chain problems that haven't improved significantly. Demand for cars continues to exceed supply, and retail used car prices are still very high, about 50 percent more than before the pandemic. The supply problems pushing up inflation seem likely to persist. Indications are that the conflict in Ukraine will continue, and that the effects of shipping disruptions of agriculture products and limits on energy supplies from Russia will continue to be a significant problem. Even with the recent agreement intended to facilitate Ukrainian grain exports, it is unclear whether supply pressures on global markets will ease as a result. An announced reduction in Russian natural gas supplies to Western Europe has driven European prices even higher, causing ripple effects on world energy markets and raising concerns about shortages this winter. China has eased some of its most stringent COVID containment measures but recently revived travel restrictions in some areas, and its approach to the pandemic remains an upside risk for inflation. Despite a slowdown in sales of new and existing homes, inventories of homes for sale and rental vacancies remain low, supporting ongoing increases in housing costs. On the other side of our dual mandate, maximum employment, we continue to see a tight labor market, though there are some emerging signs that would support  expectations of loosening. Yesterday's job report showed continued significant growth in hiring with the unemployment rate finally returning to the pre-pandemic level of 3.5 percent. As I am sure you all know, the job market in Kansas is even stronger, with an unemployment rate of 2.4 percent in June. In our state, finding workers is a bigger problem in most communities than finding a job. One aspect of the job market that has not recovered is labor force participation. Based on the pre-pandemic trend, there are nearly four million people who are still sitting out of a strong labor market. In contrast to this labor market strength in Kansas and nationwide, output growth has slowed this year. Real gross domestic product, GDP, edged lower in the second quarter, following a larger decline in the first quarter. My base case is for a pickup in growth during the second half of this year and for moderate growth in 2023. As we learned during the summer and fall of 2021, both GDP and jobs numbers are subject to significant revision, both in subsequent months and then again the next year. From my perspective, had we known at the time about the eventual large upward revisions in last year's employment data, we likely would have significantly accelerated our monetary policy actions. Going forward, we have to consider the possibility of these kinds of revisions when making real-time judgments as policymakers, which includes looking at other kinds of indicators instead of relying too heavily on the data. Taking all of that on board, while the data on economic activity are indeed lower and the view is murky, the evidence on inflation is absolutely clear, which brings me to the implications for monetary policy.  Based on current economic conditions and the outlook I just described, I supported the FOMC's decision last week to raise the federal funds rate another 75 basis points. I also support the Committee's view that ""ongoing increases"" would be appropriate at coming meetings. My view is that similarly-sized increases should be on the table until we see inflation declining in a consistent, meaningful, and lasting way. On the subject of forward guidance, I am pleased to see that following the July meeting, the FOMC ended the practice of providing specific forward guidance in our post-meeting communications. I believe that the overly specific forward guidance implemented at the December 2020 FOMC meeting requiring ""substantial further progress"" unnecessarily limited the Committee's actions in beginning the removal of accommodation later in 2021. In my view, that, combined with data revisions that were directly relevant to our decision making, led to a delay in taking action to address rising inflation. It is helpful that the FOMC provided clear direction earlier this year that it was prepared to act quickly to tighten monetary policy. Since we have now taken actions to raise rates and finally reduce the Fed's balance sheet, we are following through on that commitment. Looking ahead, the FOMC will be getting two months of data on inflation and another month on employment before our next meeting in September, and while I expect that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate, given the uncertainty in how those data and conditions will evolve, I will allow that information to guide my judgment on how big the increases will need to be. I do expect that the labor market will remain strong as we continue to increase interest rates and allow the balance sheet to run off, but there is a risk that our actions will  slow job gains, or even reduce employment. Growth has softened, and perhaps this is an indication that our actions to tighten monetary policy are having the desired effect, with the ultimate goal of bringing demand and supply into greater balance. When considering the risks to the labor market, these risks must be viewed in the context of its current strength and with the understanding that our primary challenge is to get inflation under control. In fact, the larger threat to the strong labor market is excessive inflation, which if allowed to continue could lead to a further economic softening, risking a prolonged period of economic weakness coupled with high inflation, like we experienced in the 1970s. In any case, we must fulfill our commitment to lowering inflation, and I will remain steadfastly focused on this task. With my outlook out of the way, let me turn to another of my responsibilities at the Fed, which is bank regulation and supervision. I am sure that we will have the opportunity to discuss many issues of interest to you during our discussion, but I'd like to mention a pending rulemaking that would update the Community Reinvestment Act. I understand that the draft rule was intended to provide greater clarity to banks regarding community development activities and their consideration for CRA. While I am a strong supporter of the fundamentals behind CRA, and I support community development activities, I am concerned that the proposal does not adequately account for the costs and benefits of certain provisions, and that no attempt has even been made to either ensure that or to analyze whether the benefits exceed the costs, which is a fundamental element of effective regulation. The comment period for the proposal ended on August 5, and I will repeat what I have said in the past: if this proposal affects you or your business, I  hope that you made your voice heard by submitting a comment to the more than 600- page proposal within the short 90-day comment period. Public comments really do matter when considering the content of proposed rulemakings. Of course, my comments about the benefits of public participation in rulemaking apply beyond the CRA proposal, and there are other regulatory topics on the horizon that would benefit from robust engagement. One that comes to mind is the regulatory framework for analyzing bank mergers. Earlier this year, the Justice Department requested comment on whether to revise their 1995 Bank Merger Competitive Review guidelines, seeking input on a wide range of issues. The FDIC also issued a request for information on the Bank Merger Act framework. I expect this review will be a focus across the banking agencies, and I will be very interested to see how the framework for small and regional banks is affected by any proposed change. I would be concerned about any changes that would result in making mergers among these institutions more difficult or would not address some of the longstanding issues with the existing framework. Among those are that the framework doesn't account for new technologies or overwhelming competition posed by credit unions, internet based financial services, and non-bank financial companies. Another concern is that overly strict criteria for mergers could have the unintended consequence of depriving consumers in some areas of access to any banking services. ""Banking deserts"" in rural and underserved areas are a real problem and regulators should guard against this outcome when proposing or evaluating rules. I should also briefly mention three other regulatory topics of interest to all banks, including those here today.  First, the Fed's LIBOR proposal is currently out for comment on a short timeline. That proposal implements the recently passed LIBOR Act by providing default rules for certain contracts that use the soon to be discontinued reference rate. Second, comments are currently under review for the third-party risk management guidance jointly proposed by the Fed with the other banking agencies. Banks and third parties will benefit from clear guidance that helps banks navigate the challenging issues and risks raised by third party engagement. Finally, another area that could benefit from more regulatory clarity is digital assets, including stablecoins and crypto assets. Some banks are considering expanding into a range of crypto activities, including custody, lending backed by crypto collateral, and facilitating the purchase and sale of these assets for their customers. In the absence of clear guidance, banks should consult with their primary regulator and exercise caution when engaging with customers in these types of activities. I will conclude with a brief comment on supervision. While the trend of returning to on-site bank examination is continuing, progress has been somewhat slow. This may be driven in part by the varied pace of employees returning to the office. That said, the Fed intends to return to some form of on-site supervision. We find substantial value in those in-person interactions during bank examinations. In closing, thank you again for the opportunity to speak to you today. I look forward to hearing how high inflation is affecting you and your communities and your thoughts on the regulatory agenda.","['inflation', 'inflationary', 'fed', 'kansas', 'regulation']","['continued inflation', 'rising inflation', 'inflation continued', 'inflation rising', 'pushing inflation']","['inflation continues high', 'rising inflation helpful', 'high inflation affecting', 'pushing inflation likely', 'continued inflation risk']","['continued inflation risk', 'excessive inflation', 'high inflation', 'elevated inflation', 'federal funds rate']"
7671,r220817a_FOMC,united states,2022-08-17,Working Women in the Pandemic Era,bowman,0,"It's a pleasure to be with you today to talk about a subject that I experience directly--women's labor force participation. I come to this issue with a similar perspective to this Commission, being from a heavily rural state and a small farming and ranching community deep in the Flint Hills of Kansas. But I also have roots here in Arkansas, my husband's family is from Hardy, and my father's mother was from Little Rock. It's really nice to be back in an area where I spent a lot of time growing up. My husband and I returned home to Kansas with our two children under three in late 2009, just as the impacts of the last financial crisis were making their way to rural areas. At the time, I was a community banker, which means I was also a very active member of the community. As I am sure many of you did then, I saw firsthand the economic impacts of the recession and the increased drug and opioid use that devastated many rural communities across the Midwest. At that time, many in the community received benefits from well-intended programs created to provide assistance, which often made it very difficult for small employers to find employees. This was often because, as I learned when trying to hire employees at our local chamber of commerce, the benefit from taking a job was much less than the benefit one could receive from the government at that time while not working. This is one major similarity between the current experience and the last recession, except that in this episode, the benefits many received were far in excess of what they could earn from working. So much so that the benefits provided to a large number of Americans resulted in a significant increase in savings, which is only recently  beginning to decline and likely leading many who had not yet decided to re-enter the workforce to find work. These labor supply problems, as I will explain, are a large part of women's experience in the workforce since the pandemic, and the lesson from this and other recessions is that policymakers need to carefully weigh all of the consequences of their decisions. It is fair to say that the majority of the economic conditions we are experiencing today, like inflation, are different from those of the last financial crisis. But as I just noted, there are some similarities in the impacts on the labor force. Turning to the subject of my remarks today, I will discuss the role of women in the U.S. economy, focusing on the period since the onset of COVID-19. You may already know that women suffered disproportionately more job losses than men during the pandemic. This was the opposite of what happened in past recessions, when men lost jobs at a higher rate than women. The difference this time has led some to call the 2020 downturn a ""she-cession."" Most of the differences between how men and women fared in the labor market during that time had reversed by 2021, but their different experiences highlight how participation by men and women can sometimes be driven by different forces. The backdrop for recent events is the long history, starting after World War II, of women gradually entering the labor market. Of course, women have always significantly contributed to and played a large role in the U.S. economy, but initially in ways that don't show up in most government statistics. The rise of industrialization and the shift away from an agrarian economy provided opportunities for men to work outside the home and  women took on more responsibility for cooking, sewing, child-rearing and other domestic tasks. We heard an echo of that history during the pandemic, because when schools closed and other childcare was disrupted, women assumed the majority of those caregiving responsibilities, which led many to quit their jobs and drop out of the labor force. This magnified the effect by eliminating jobs in childcare resulting in even more unemployment. But that wasn't the only reason why women were impacted during this episode. Let me start with the big picture on the differences between men and women in the labor market. Before 1950, few women worked outside the home and the majority of those who did were unmarried. From 1950 to 1970, more women entered the workforce, but many did not plan to work for the long term, and their investment in education and training was often limited. By the mid-1970s, barriers that limited opportunities for women in many workplaces began to fall, and by 1990 the education gap between men and women narrowed significantly. Women's participation steadily increased from there until the gains leveled off in the 1990s, but then rose again from 2015 to 2020, just before the pandemic. The narrowing of educational attainment for men and women had a lot to do with the narrowing of participation rates over the decades, and today women are more likely than men to hold a bachelor's degree. Even so, before the pandemic, overall participation remained lower for women than men regardless of education level.  The response to the COVID-19 pandemic caused the most abrupt decline in employment in the history of this nation. The lockdowns and other government restrictions on businesses severely limited work, education, and travel. In February 2020, over 60 percent of working-age people had a job or were looking for work, but by April it was closer to half that amount. The pandemic hit all sectors of the economy, but the toll was especially heavy on in-person, close-contact service industries--restaurants, hotels, airline travel, and retail businesses other than big box stores, grocery stores and pharmacies. These in-person service-industry jobs were considered more conducive to spreading COVID-19, they were more affected by government-mandated shutdowns and social distancing, and teleworking was generally not possible. Unlike any previous recession, the downturn in employment fell more heavily on women than men. The unemployment rates for men and women were essentially the same before the pandemic but ended up much higher for women. That was very different from past recessions. For example, after the recession following the housing crisis, unemployment for prime working age men rose to 11 percent, compared to only 9 percent for prime age women. The women's labor force participation rate is another way to measure their presence in the workforce. Women have made significant progress in closing the gap with men since the 1960s, including in the five years before the pandemic, but that gap  reopened after the onset of COVID-19. The number of both prime working age men and women in the labor force plunged, but the drop was half a million larger for women. From what we know now, there appear to be two main reasons why the pandemic downturn affected women more than men. First, even after the dramatic employment gains over the past 50 years, women are still most often the primary caregivers to children and other family members. They shouldered most of the childcare burden from the COVID school closures. Second, a higher proportion of women worked in and continue to be employed in positions in the high-contact service sectors that were hit hardest by the pandemic. Caregiving burdens in the United States have always fallen more heavily on women. In the 20 years before the pandemic, roughly one-fourth of prime-age women with children didn't participate in the workforce. An even larger share of women with children under five were primarily engaged in childcare. Many women with children tend to cycle in and out of employment based on their family's childcare demands. Women are significantly affected by the summer childcare burdens of families with children. Each year between May and July, when schools close for the summer, the employment-to-population ratio for prime age women declines by more than a percentage point and then rebounds when schools reopen in the fall. That difference is one-third of the total drop that prime-age women experienced following a very bad recession, the one following the housing crisis.  Today, working women still carry out most childcare responsibilities. One study conducted before the pandemic found that when both parents work, women spend 50 percent more time on childcare than men. And when the pandemic closed many schools, it was largely women who stayed home. Women with children saw their labor force participation rate and employment-to-population ratio fall more than for women without children, while men were much less affected regardless of whether they had children. According to one Federal Reserve study, increased caregiving burdens for mothers with school aged children accounted for about three-fourths of the decline in women in the labor force from February 2020 to August 2021 but only about one-third of the decline for fathers. Even after most children returned to in-person schooling, caregiving continues to weigh on female participation in the labor force, likely because of increased care for elderly or ill family members. The other major factor affecting women during the pandemic was the larger number of female employees in high-contact service-sector jobs, where demand dropped sharply during the pandemic and the government-imposed restrictions in response to During past recessions, women experienced fewer job losses because service- sector jobs were more stable in downturns. Historically, goods-producing industries were harder hit, and men, who tended to hold these roles, were more likely to lose their jobs. But during the pandemic, it was service jobs that were more likely to be lost. Before the  pandemic, more than 75 percent of these workers were women. Between February and April 2020, service sector employment fell 40 percent. Job losses in other industries with greater proportions of male workers, like manufacturing, were much smaller. We have also seen recovery in service-sector jobs lag behind other sectors. Employment in industries that tend to have larger shares of female workers, such as leisure and hospitality, education, and health services, is still below pre-pandemic levels. The losses for women are even larger when considering how fast these industries were growing before the pandemic. The shift to remote work may have been a mitigating factor for employment for women without college degrees. Overall, workers without college degrees were hit particularly hard by the pandemic recession because remote work was much more common for those with a degree. However, women without degrees were affected less than men, probably because the jobs they held were more likely to be able to be performed remotely than those of men without college degrees. We have seen a substantial recovery in the labor market for both genders since the worst of the pandemic. By the end of 2020, unemployment rates had equalized, and the gap between gender participation rates had returned to pre-pandemic levels in 2021. However, because that gap had been narrowing in the five years prior to the onset of COVID, we can assume that the participation gap would have continued to decrease over that time.  So, based on what we know about the history and recent experience of women in the labor market, what does the future hold for working women? On the demand side, the labor market continues to be strong and there are abundant job opportunities for workers of all education and skill levels. With about four million fewer people participating in the workforce today, there are still plenty of jobs available even if we see the number of job openings reduced. We are also seeing a larger number of women graduating from college than men, a development that is likely to help insulate women from job losses in future recessions. One complication is that the future of labor supply is uncertain, and it is difficult to predict how labor force participation will evolve. Factors like generational aging were already weighing on labor supply before the pandemic, and we saw millions of workers accelerate retirement during the pandemic, effectively retiring early. Even the strong labor market has not yet lured many of these early retirees back, and some believe that as time passes it becomes less likely that they will return. Over time, those who chose to leave the workforce early will move into a normal retirement age. We really don't know if gender will be a factor here as this is the first generation to retire that had large numbers of women in the workforce, but workforce aging is an important consideration when it comes to labor supply. We also don't know how the influence of inflation will affect decision making about returning to the workforce, but some may feel compelled to return to work. Another consideration is caregiving demands and how those responsibilities will be shared within households. While I hope that we never see a public health emergency like the one we've just been through, I hope that if we do, we can avoid the governmental  decisions to intentionally disrupt foundational education and the unnecessary forced isolation of children. These policies have left a significant impact on this generation of children, on families and their decision making about many things including participation in the labor force. One ongoing labor supply issue relates to the lingering effects of COVID that can interfere with the ability to work or impose additional caregiving needs for family members. By one account, nearly a fifth of adults who contracted COVID reported ongoing symptoms of ""long COVID,"" affecting significantly more women than men. At the same time, the number of working-age people with disabilities has increased significantly. While the number of Americans reporting a disability had been rising gradually over the past decade, the increase picked up in mid-2020, and about 2 million more people reported they had a disability in July 2022 than at the outset of the pandemic. Disability has been a major drag on the work force in rural areas in the past. Living in rural Kansas following the last recession, as I mentioned earlier, I am very familiar with the challenges that disability presents for many aspects of the community-- beyond just economic conditions. Disability is also a significant challenge in Arkansas. Women's labor force attachment in Arkansas is below the national average. In the five years before the pandemic, about 72 percent of prime-age women here were either working or looking for work, compared with 75 percent nationally. This difference in  labor force participation is primarily explained by illness or disability and existed long before the onset of COVID. There is no magic wand that will draw workers back into the labor force, especially when generous government benefits programs are provided for those who are capable of working. But as challenging as these issues are to address, there are some lessons to draw from experience and research regarding approaches that encourage people to work. Research suggests that assistance programs including job search assistance, training programs, and private-sector employment subsidies increase the likelihood of employment by up to 10 percent for those who utilize the programs. benefits of this assistance are not always immediately realized, but women were more likely to benefit from job training and private-sector employment programs. In conclusion, although we still have about 4 million people out of the pre- pandemic workforce, we continue to see strong employment gains and low unemployment rates--the kind of labor market that historically has pulled in more workers. As the service sector continues to recover and as schools and childcare establishments open more fully, I see potential for greater employment opportunities for women in the future. Obviously, economic conditions will influence job opportunities going forward. Today's high inflation and strong employment will likely create some pressure on labor and employment.","['rural', 'households', 'workforce', 'recession', 'participation']","['force rural', 'rural communities', 'participate workforce', 'recessions women', 'workforce women']","['work force rural', 'female participation labor', 'force rural areas', 'rural communities midwest', 'labor force participation']","['labor force participation', 'many rural communities', 'rural kansas', 'labor force participation rate', 'sector employment programs']"

3997,r220825a_BOJ,japan,2022-08-25,"Economic Activity, Prices, and Monetary Policy in Japan",nakamura,0,"I will begin my speech by talking about recent developments in economic activity and prices. Overseas economies have recovered on the whole, albeit with some weakness seen in part consumption, although some weakness has been seen in several sectors. The Chinese economy has started to pick up, led mainly by exports and production, with the impact of lockdowns and other public health measures waning. Emerging and commodity-exporting economies other than China have generally picked up with the resumption of economic activity becoming full-fledged. Against this background, Japan's economy has also picked up with the impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) waning, despite being affected by factors such as rises in the price of commodities, including grain. In the corporate sector, exports have increased as a trend, although they have been under strong downward pressure due to supply-side constraints. Business fixed investment has picked up, albeit with effects of supply-side constraints. In the household sector, private consumption has increased moderately, particularly for services consumption, with the impact of COVID-19 waning and also with support from the materialization of pent-up demand. Meanwhile, the consumer price index (CPI) for all items less fresh food, or core CPI, has increased to 2.4 percent on a year-on-year basis, mainly due to rises in energy and food prices (Chart 2). Japan's economy is likely to recover as the impact of COVID-19 and the effects of supply- side constraints gradually wane. The year-on-year rate of change in core CPI is likely to increase toward the end of 2022 due to rises in the price of such items as energy, food, and durable goods. Thereafter, the rate of increase is expected to decelerate as the positive contribution of the rise in energy prices to the CPI wanes. This outlook is subject to a number of uncertainties; specifically, I am particularly attentive to the following factors. The first is how COVID-19 at home and abroad will affect Japan's economy. If vigilance against COVID-19 becomes elevated again in Japan due to a rapid resurgence of the disease, the positive contribution of pent-up demand could weaken by more than expected, particularly in services consumption; this could pose the risk of a downward deviation in private consumption from the baseline scenario and of a delayed pick-up in inbound tourism consumption due mainly to entry restriction measures. In the meantime, if pandemic-related restrictions become stricter again in China while the global semiconductor shortage continues, supply-side constraints could become prolonged and amplified through, for example, supply- chain disruptions. This could then exert downward pressure on Japan's exports and production, goods consumption, and business fixed investment. The second factor is developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine and in the price of commodities, including grain. As investment in natural resource development has been constrained in response to global efforts toward addressing climate change, there have been growing uncertainties over geopolitical factors, particularly the situation surrounding Ukraine. Under these circumstances, there is a risk that the price of commodities, including grain, will rise or remain high for a prolonged period, which could cause further downward pressure on the global economy, especially the euro area. In particular, Germany, which has been leading the euro area economy for many years, is expected to pay a large price for having to break away from a value chain that is mainly dependent on Russia. Thus, I am carefully monitoring developments regarding this matter, including its effects on Europe as a whole. The third factor I am particularly attentive to is developments in overseas economic activity and prices and in global financial and capital markets. Amid a continued rise in inflation, mainly in advanced economies, central banks have been raising policy rates significantly. Central banks in the United States and Europe seem to be prioritizing the containment of inflation even at the risk of some degree of economic slowdown. However, there is concern in global financial and capital markets over whether it is possible to contain inflation and avoid a recession simultaneously. If such concern grows substantially, there is a risk that financial conditions will tighten further globally through adjustments in asset prices and foreign exchange rates, and through capital outflows from emerging economies. There is also a risk that this will lead to a significant slowdown in overseas economies. I am therefore paying due attention to developments in financial and foreign exchange markets and their impact on economic activity, prices, and wages in Japan. Let me now turn to my basic view on the conduct of monetary policy for the immediate future, based on the economic and price developments I have just described. In view of Japan's present economic conditions, I consider it necessary for the Bank of Japan to persistently continue with the current powerful monetary easing. Here are three major reasons. The first reason is that Japan's economy is still on its way to recovery from the downturn caused by COVID-19. Although exports and private consumption in particular have been picking up, Japan's real GDP has not yet recovered to the pre-pandemic 2019 average level, unlike in the United States and the euro area (Chart 3). The output gap, which captures the utilization of labor and capital, has been consistently negative since the April-June quarter of 2020 (Chart 4). As demand remains insufficient compared with supply capacity, a shift in the direction of monetary policy toward tightening would likely drag down the economy and put significant downward pressure on the economic activity of firms and households. The second reason is that the current price rises in Japan and those in the United States and Europe differ considerably in terms of degree and the number of items. Comparing price developments in Japan with those abroad shows a significant difference: the year-on-year rate of change in consumer prices for all items exceeds 8 percent in the United States and Europe, while the rate of change in core CPI in Japan is 2.4 percent (Chart 5). The breakdown of price change distributions by item indicates that in the United States and Europe, where the economies recovered from the downturn caused by COVID-19 earlier than Japan, prices have risen significantly for a wide range of items, including services. In Japan on the other hand, a limited number of items such as energy and food are the main contributors to price rises, and the rate of increase in the price of many items, including services, remains low, suggesting that the country is experiencing only imported inflation (Chart 6). This difference is likely due to the disparity in wage inflation. In the United States and Europe, economic recovery from the downturn caused by the pandemic was accompanied by significant upward pressure on wages. In Japan, however, wage inflation remains low because the level of economic activity is still on its way to recovery and wage increases have been suppressed by structural challenges that I will discuss later. In the current situation, where cost-push factors from imported goods have resulted in significant price rises for only certain items, I believe that targeted policy action is more effective than monetary policy aimed at reducing aggregate demand. The third reason I consider it necessary for the Bank to persistently continue with the current powerful monetary easing is that the 2 percent price stability target needs to be achieved in a sustainable and stable manner. The year-on-year rate of change in core CPI is likely to increase toward the end of 2022 due to rises in the price of such items as energy, food, and durable goods. However, the positive contribution of the rise in energy prices to the CPI is likely to dissipate thereafter. Thus, my current assessment is that it is difficult for the price stability target to be achieved in a sustainable and stable manner. Specifically, the year-on- year rate of increase in core CPI is projected to decline to the 1.0-1.5 percent range from fiscal 2023 onward, according to the median of the Policy Board members' forecasts presented in percent price stability target is a key performance indicator whose progress should be monitored continuously to realize the sound development of the national economy, I would like to emphasize the importance of core CPI becoming 2 percent in a stable manner, accompanied by a sustainable rise in wages; it is not enough for core CPI to reach 2 percent temporarily due to such factors as a rise in energy prices. Even if the higher price of some items pushes up the overall price level to 2 percent, unless household disposable income increases, spending on products and services will decline due to budget constraints. This will lead to a vicious cycle in which rises in overall prices will be restrained and economic activity will be sluggish, thereby putting downward pressure on wages. Thus, Japan's economy is only halfway to achieving the price stability target. Taking these three points into particular account, I consider that the Bank should continue with the current monetary easing at this point. At the same time, as inflation progresses globally, I have a feeling that there has been a change in the entrenched views and practices in Japan that are based on the assumption that prices will not increase. Inflation is a common economic phenomenon in the world, and nominal wages should grow faster than inflation when labor productivity improves. However, prices in Japan have barely increased over the past 30 years. Thus, even if firms could not raise wages, employees did not typically leave to take another job, as I will elaborate later (Chart 8). Meanwhile, there is now less room to increase the labor force participation of the elderly and women, and labor shortages have become more severe (Chart 9). In this situation, wage growth becomes increasingly important for firms to secure their workforce, forcing them to face the strategic challenges of increasing productivity and thereby raising labor compensation. To address these challenges, both small and medium-sized firms and large firms are expected to operate a virtuous cycle in which they increase the value added and competitiveness of their products and services and raise their prices, thereby securing resources for wage growth. A survey by the Japanese Trade Union Confederation, or Rengo, shows that the average rate of increase in wages, i.e., increases in base pay and regular salaries combined, for fiscal 2022 is 2.07 percent, suggesting that wage growth both at large firms and at small and medium- sized firms exceeds that of the previous fiscal year. Earlier this month, a labor ministry advisory panel put forward a proposal to raise the nation's average hourly minimum wage for the current fiscal year by 31 yen, or 3.3 percent, which would be a record increase. Meanwhile, a survey targeting large firms conducted by the Japan Business Federation, or Keidanren, indicates that summer bonuses have increased by more than 8 percent. All these demonstrate that wage increases have started to be widely observed, reflecting the pick-up in overall economic activity while labor shortages continue. It is essential that such wage inflation be realized not only this year but also from next year onward in a sustainable manner. Thus, the key is how bonuses for this winter and wage revisions for the next fiscal year will turn out. To realize wage growth, it is necessary to strike a balance between the protection of public health and the reopening of economic activity at the earliest possible time, thereby enabling the economy to recover from the downturn caused by COVID-19. Meanwhile, Japanese firms need to reform their business lines to fit the business environment that has changed dramatically due to the pandemic. The Bank is committed to continuing to support firms' initiatives through the current monetary easing. Achieving the 2 percent price stability target calls for a sustainable and stable increase in household disposable income, mainly by means of higher wages. This gives rise to a virtuous cycle: Higher disposable income underpins greater household spending, which represents final demand, which then feeds into an expansion in corporate sales and profits. Firms draw on the funds generated by greater sales and profits and on leverage arising from such means as cash borrowing for investments aimed at enhancing their added value. Firms that increase the value of their products, services, and labor reflect this in selling prices, and then grow by acquiring the resources needed for further wage increases and investments (Chart 10 gives a simplified representation). However, international comparisons show that, since the first half of the 1990s, household disposable income has more than tripled in the United States and about doubled in Germany, but it has hardly increased in Japan (Chart 11). I would like to share my views on the three dynamisms necessary to break out of this stagnation in disposable income, based on my own experience at a private firm. My first point is about the dynamism of firms. Many Japanese firms long wrestled with declining profitability and a deterioration in business performance. This stems from several factors, including the yen's sharp appreciation following the 1985 Plaza Accord and the bursting of the bubble economy in the early 1990s, coupled with the higher price of imported raw materials brought about by overseas economic growth and with the inflow of low-priced goods from developing economies. At the same time, firms faced strong social pressure in Japan to maintain employment. They responded by overhauling their cost structure, cutting fixed expenses, such as personnel expenses -- including wages and ""investment in people"" -- and research and development (R&D) expenses, all the while maintaining their existing business portfolios. This gave rise to excessive competition among firms in Japan and waning profitability and growth potential. Meanwhile, from 2008, firms' entry rates were in the range of 4-6 percent and exit rates were almost constantly below 4 percent. Thus, both entry and exit rates remained low vis-a-vis international levels (Chart 12). This situation points to limited corporate metabolism, in terms of the redistribution of resources through the entry into and exit from businesses. This dearth of corporate dynamism, coupled with the onset of deflation in the latter half of the 1990s, seems to have precipitated sluggish growth in productivity and wages stemming from a lack of innovation and investment. In other words, in a deflationary environment where prices continue to fall, firms find it more difficult to make aggressive investment that carries risks because the expected rate of return on investment declines. Firms therefore put priority on securing profits and cash flow by cutting costs. Meanwhile, under slow corporate metabolism and the traditional practice of lifetime employment, if a firm were to go bankrupt and employees lost their jobs, their biggest worry is finding a new job. As a result, employees seek stability of employment over higher wages. This situation makes it possible to prioritize the survival of a business in the short term, but as the global competition becomes more intense, overseas economies are growing in tandem with firms' efforts to increase the added value of their products and services, with wages and prices following suit. Unless firms in Japan increase the added value of their products and services as well, both firms' and their employees' capacity to generate earnings will gradually weaken. The bold monetary easing and flexible fiscal policy pursued since 2013 have served to arrest the deflationary trend. Firms have also begun realigning their business portfolios in an effort to identify and concentrate on their core competencies. For example, firms have consolidated less productive businesses under their best owners (companies that are expected to maximize the value of the business over the medium to long term) through merger and acquisition and Japan's economy once again registered negative growth. Now that the economy is recovering from the worst of the pandemic, global inflationary pressures have increased. While firms in the United States and Europe have made headway in passing on costs to prices and increasing wages, those in Japan have made relatively limited progress in passing on 1 and 11). This has given rise to a growing awareness among management or business owners that an increase in the added value of products and services and investment in people for that purpose, including raising wages, are critical strategic challenges for business growth. My hope is that, alongside the growth of startups that create and foster innovation, these recent developments will revive the dynamism of Japanese firms and lead to the sustainable growth of Japan's economy. My second point concerns the dynamism of employment. Many analyses have shown that in the United States and Europe, the redistribution of resources, including labor mobility between industries and firms, has moved ahead since the outbreak of COVID-19, and that this has contributed to greater labor productivity. By contrast, it seems that Japan to date has not shown similar signs of a full-fledged resource redistribution. According to an analysis by the Bank's staff, resource redistribution between industries has made only a very slight contribution to boosting real labor productivity, even after the onset of the pandemic (Chart 14). Moreover, the proportion of people changing jobs versus all employed persons is around 4 percent, and that of people changing jobs between regular employment versus all employed persons is only around 1 percent (Chart 15). In contrast, the proportion of people changing Differences in the extent of resource redistribution through such job changes and other avenues, and in the ensuing pace of improvement in labor productivity, could also be engendering differences in wage inflation. In the United States, the wages of people who have not changed jobs have been rising together with the wages of those who have (Chart 17). Even in the United States and Europe, although people who change jobs in pursuit of higher wages represent only a part of total employees, in my view, the fear that employees might migrate to other firms has spurred management or business owners to work to boost productivity and improve employee pay and benefits. Also, under job-based employment contracts that tie wages to the evaluation of individual ability, the stronger capabilities of workers themselves may be pushing labor productivity upward. I suspect this is having a spillover effect even on the wages of people who have not changed jobs. To bring about a more active redistribution of resources by means of job changes and other avenues, economic recovery from the downturn caused by the pandemic will be vital, as well as business growth driven by the revival of corporate dynamism. At the same time, I believe institutional improvements are needed, including developing a social safety net that encourages a positive approach to taking on challenges and a social security system that is sustainable and does not disadvantage those who change jobs. I believe that, in Japan, ""investment in people"" used to be considered a labor cost rather than an investment in the intangible asset of human capital. To build momentum in which wages continue to rise year after year, revitalizing such investment will be crucial, though it is an employment emerges and firms turn to more active investment in human capital, I expect this to strengthen the added-value output of individuals, and in turn that of firms, thus accelerating the virtuous cycle of income and prices. The third point necessary to increase household disposable income is the dynamism of household financial assets. Although household financial assets in Japan have grown to more than 2,000 trillion yen, a breakdown of those assets shows that growth in equity and investment trusts has been lackluster. As of the end of March 1992, after the bursting of the bubble economy, Japan's share of holdings of equity and investment trusts within overall household financial assets was 15 percent, and in the United States it was 37 percent. However, as of the end of March 2021, a wider gap has formed, with the share at 15 percent in Japan and 51 percent in the United States household dividend income in Japan has been more or less flat since the early 1990s. In the United States and Germany, meanwhile, both employee income and dividend income are contributing to an increase in disposable income (Chart 11). Firms are not only places that provide employment and wages but also vehicles for creating added value. Although employee income accounts for the bulk of household disposable income in Japan, most people can only work for a single employer. Therefore, to reap the benefits of the growth of many firms outside their own places of work, including that of listed firms, people have to invest. If the trend of stable asset formation -- through the investment of surplus funds in financial assets focusing on the long term, on risk diversification, and on regular contributions -- gains traction, it will bring dynamism to household financial assets. This development will give more depth to disposable income in Japan and as a result, Japan's economy can expect more robust private consumption to help close the macroeconomic output gap and further boost corporate activities. With institutional support already available, growing interest in investment trusts, especially among young people. Moreover, the Japanese government's Council of New Form of Capitalism Realization has announced its intention to formulate a plan to double asset income in Japan. I look forward to these developments gaining momentum. As has been illustrated, I expect the virtuous cycle of income and prices to be reinforced as the dynamism of firms and employment spurs corporate growth, while the dynamism of employment and household financial assets stimulates a rise in household income. By providing accommodative financial conditions to persistently support these developments, I believe Japan's economy will approach the realization of the 2 percent price stability target, which will in turn lead to its sound development.

7672,r220826a_FOMC,united states,2022-08-26,Monetary Policy and Price Stability,powell,1,"Thank you for the opportunity to speak here today. At past Jackson Hole conferences, I have discussed broad topics such as the ever- changing structure of the economy and the challenges of conducting monetary policy under high uncertainty. Today, my remarks will be shorter, my focus narrower, and my message more direct. to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal. Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy. Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. The burdens of high inflation fall heaviest on those who are least able to bear them. Restoring price stability will take some time and requires using our tools forcefully to bring demand and supply into better balance. Reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below-trend growth. Moreover, there will very likely be some softening of labor market conditions. While higher interest rates, slower growth, and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to households and businesses. These are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation. But a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain. The U.S. economy is clearly slowing from the historically high growth rates of 2021, which reflected the reopening of the economy following the pandemic recession. While the latest economic data have been mixed, in my view our economy continues to show strong underlying momentum. The labor market is particularly strong, but it is clearly out of balance, with demand for workers substantially exceeding the supply of  available workers. Inflation is running well above 2 percent, and high inflation has continued to spread through the economy. While the lower inflation readings for July are welcome, a single month's improvement falls far short of what the Committee will need to see before we are confident that inflation is moving down. We are moving our policy stance purposefully to a level that will be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent. At our most recent meeting in July, the FOMC raised the target range for the federal funds rate to 2.25 to 2.5 percent, which is in the Summary of Economic Projection's (SEP) range of estimates of where the federal funds rate is projected to settle in the longer run. In current circumstances, with inflation running far above 2 percent and the labor market extremely tight, estimates of longer-run neutral are not a place to stop or pause. July's increase in the target range was the second 75 basis point increase in as many meetings, and I said then that another unusually large increase could be appropriate at our next meeting. We are now about halfway through the intermeeting period. Our decision at the September meeting will depend on the totality of the incoming data and the evolving outlook. At some point, as the stance of monetary policy tightens further, it likely will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases. Restoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive policy stance for some time. The historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy. Committee participants' most recent individual projections from the June SEP showed the median federal funds rate running slightly below 4 percent through the end of 2023. Participants will update their projections at the September meeting.  Our monetary policy deliberations and decisions build on what we have learned about inflation dynamics both from the high and volatile inflation of the 1970s and 1980s, and from the low and stable inflation of the past quarter-century. In particular, we are drawing on three important lessons. The first lesson is that central banks can and should take responsibility for delivering low and stable inflation. It may seem strange now that central bankers and others once needed convincing on these two fronts, but as former Chairman Ben Bernanke has shown, both propositions were widely questioned during the Great Inflation period. Today, we regard these questions as settled. Our responsibility to deliver price stability is unconditional. It is true that the current high inflation is a global phenomenon, and that many economies around the world face inflation as high or higher than seen here in the United States. It is also true, in my view, that the current high inflation in the United States is the product of strong demand and constrained supply, and that the Fed's tools work principally on aggregate demand. None of this diminishes the Federal Reserve's responsibility to carry out our assigned task of achieving price stability. There is clearly a job to do in moderating demand to better align with supply. We are committed to doing that job. The second lesson is that the public's expectations about future inflation can play an important role in setting the path of inflation over time. Today, by many measures, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored. That is broadly true of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, and of market-based measures as  well. But that is not grounds for complacency, with inflation having run well above our goal for some time. If the public expects that inflation will remain low and stable over time, then, absent major shocks, it likely will. Unfortunately, the same is true of expectations of high and volatile inflation. During the 1970s, as inflation climbed, the anticipation of high inflation became entrenched in the economic decisionmaking of households and businesses. The more inflation rose, the more people came to expect it to remain high, and they built that belief into wage and pricing decisions. As former Chairman Paul Volcker put it at the height of the Great Inflation in 1979, ""Inflation feeds in part on itself, so part of the job of returning to a more stable and more productive economy must be to break the grip of inflationary expectations."" One useful insight into how actual inflation may affect expectations about its future path is based in the concept of ""rational inattention."" When inflation is persistently high, households and businesses must pay close attention and incorporate inflation into their economic decisions. When inflation is low and stable, they are freer to all practical purposes, price stability means that expected changes in the average price level are small enough and gradual enough that they do not materially enter business and household financial decisions.""  Of course, inflation has just about everyone's attention right now, which highlights a particular risk today: The longer the current bout of high inflation continues, the greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become entrenched. That brings me to the third lesson, which is that we must keep at it until the job is done. History shows that the employment costs of bringing down inflation are likely to increase with delay, as high inflation becomes more entrenched in wage and price setting. The successful Volcker disinflation in the early 1980s followed multiple failed attempts to lower inflation over the previous 15 years. A lengthy period of very restrictive monetary policy was ultimately needed to stem the high inflation and start the process of getting inflation down to the low and stable levels that were the norm until the spring of last year. Our aim is to avoid that outcome by acting with resolve now. These lessons are guiding us as we use our tools to bring inflation down. We are taking forceful and rapid steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment with supply, and to keep inflation expectations anchored. We will keep at it until we are confident the job is done.","['inflation', 'inflationary', 'recession', 'monetary', 'stability']","['stable inflation', 'reducing inflation', 'inflation continues', 'inflation continued', 'inflation running']","['inflation low stable', 'low stable inflation', 'reducing inflation failure', 'reducing inflation likely', 'stable inflation past']","['stable inflation', 'current high inflation', 'future inflation', 'lower inflation readings', 'inflation dynamics']"
3228,r220827a_ECB,euro area,2022-08-27,Monetary policy and the Great Volatility,schnabel,0,"The Great Moderation was a period of prosperity and broad macroeconomic stability. The volatility of both inflation and output declined, the length of economic expansions increased, and people in most economies experienced sustained improvements in their standards of living. There is broad agreement that better monetary policy was an important factor behind the Great Moderation. As central banks took up the fight against spiralling inflation in the late 1970s and early 1980s, they brought down and stabilised inflation expectations at levels that provided a solid nominal anchor for firms and households. The subsequent advance of inflation targeting around the world is believed to be a prime reason why the global financial crisis of 2008 merely interrupted the Great Moderation. Afterwards, macroeconomic volatility quickly dropped back to its previous low levels. Yet, monetary policy was not the only factor behind the Great Moderation. Good luck, in the sense of a smaller variance of the shocks hitting the global economy, is widely believed to have played an important role as well. Compared with the 1970s, for example, real oil prices traded in a much narrower range from the second half of the 1980s until the mid-2000s. The question I would like to discuss this morning is whether the pandemic, and more recently Russia's invasion of Ukraine, will herald a turning point for macroeconomic stability - that is, whether the Great Moderation will give way to a period of ""Great Volatility"" - or whether these shocks, albeit significant, will ultimately prove temporary, as was the case for the global financial crisis. My answer to this question is that of a ""two-handed economist"". On the one hand, there is a tangible risk that the nature and persistence of the shocks hitting our economies will remain unfavourable over the coming years. On the other hand, the decisions that central banks are taking today to deal with high inflation can shape the future course of our economies in a way that mitigates and limits the ultimate impact of these shocks on prosperity and stability. The pandemic and the war in Ukraine have led to an unprecedented increase in macroeconomic volatility. Output growth volatility in the euro area over the past two years was about five times as high as it was at the peak of the Great Recession in 2009. Inflation volatility has surged beyond the levels seen during the 1970s. Once the exceptional effects of the pandemic and the war wash out from the data, output and inflation volatility are bound to decline. Yet, there are valid grounds to believe that policymakers will find themselves in a less favourable environment over the medium term - one in which shocks are potentially larger, more persistent and more frequent. Climate change is a major driver. The experience of recent years leaves no doubt that the incidence and severity of extreme and disruptive weather events are rising sharply, exposing the global economy to greater volatility in output and inflation. This summer, the European Union - like many other parts of the world - is suffering from one of the most severe droughts on record, with nearly two-thirds of its territory in a state of alert or warning. The pandemic and the war are likely to add to instability in the years to come. They challenge two of the fundamental stabilising forces that have contributed to the decline in volatility during the Great Moderation: globalisation and an elastic energy supply. Globalisation acted as a gigantic shock absorber. The breakup of the Soviet Union and global economic liberalisation from the 1980s onwards led to about half of today's world population being integrated into the global economy. Labour supply became so abundant, and production capacity so large, that even periods of strong demand rarely succeeded in putting persistent upward pressure on prices and wages. However, even before the pandemic, protectionism and nationalism were on the rise. Tariff and non-tariff barriers were raised as the benefits of free trade were increasingly being called into question. Today, the world economy is at risk of fracturing into competing security and trade blocs. The international network that connects our economies is fragile. We are witnessing new and alarming forms of protectionism. Consider health. Although vaccines have been rolled out in advanced economies for nearly two years now, a third of the world population is still unvaccinated. Unequal access to effective COVID-19 vaccines means that ending the pandemic remains elusive. Food protectionism, meanwhile, is causing misery and social unrest in parts of the world. The number of governments imposing export restrictions on food and fertilizers is close to that recorded during the 2008-2012 food crisis, exacerbating the repercussions of the war on food supply. Protectionism is going hand-in-hand with a fundamental reappraisal of global value chains. Many critical inputs to our modern societies, such as semiconductor chips, are produced in just a handful of countries. Europe's energy crisis has exposed the deep fragilities of such an economic system. Efforts to enhance diversification will help secure strategic autonomy and make value chains more robust. But they also imply duplication and inefficiency. And if used as a form of protectionism, a greater reliance on domestic production may leave countries - rather than less - vulnerable to shocks in the future. The second stabilising force - an elastic energy supply - will also become less powerful in absorbing shocks in the years to come. Following the oil price shocks of the 1970s, the distribution of global oil supply changed drastically. OPEC's global market share fell from 53% in 1973 to 28% in 1985 as Mexico, Norway and other countries started producing significant amounts of oil. The ""Shale Revolution"" in the United States, which started at the turn of the century, changed the oil market once again. It is estimated to have resulted in a significant increase in the price elasticity of oil and gas supply. As a result, just as globalisation led to excess supply in product and labour markets, limiting price and wage increases, the emergence of the United States as a large net exporter of energy buffered the impact of demand shocks on oil and gas prices over the past 15 years. The green transition and the war in Ukraine will lastingly make fossil energy scarcer and more expensive at a time when renewable energy carriers are not yet sufficiently scalable. Over the coming months, acute shortages, in particular in Europe, may require painful adjustments to production and consumption. The shift to greener technologies will reduce such pressures over the longer run, but it will also broaden the sources of energy shocks during the transition. Most green technologies require significant amounts of metals and minerals, such as copper, lithium and cobalt. As their supply is constrained in the short and medium term, and often concentrated in a small number of countries, action to quickly reduce our dependency on fossil energy will lead to firms and governments competing for scarce commodities, thereby pushing up prices. Of course, such fundamental and disruptive changes to the structure of our economies also offer important opportunities. There is hope that the war in Ukraine unites those who embrace the values of liberty, territorial integrity and democracy. And the determined fight against climate change holds the potential for strong and sustainable growth. But even then, the challenges we are facing are likely to bring about larger, more frequent and more persistent shocks in the years ahead. The transition to the Great Volatility is not a pre-determined outcome, however. If the nature of the shocks changes - that is, if one of the factors that had contributed to the Great Moderation subsides - the other factor - better policies - becomes more important in ensuring macroeconomic stability. Fiscal policy will play an important role in enhancing the resilience of our economies. Governments need to adapt their policies to the risk of a protracted period of lower potential output growth. With debt-to-GDP ratios at or close to historical highs, spending should focus on protecting social cohesion and promoting productive and green investments that will help secure long-term prosperity and rebuild fiscal space needed to cushion future shocks. Monetary policy, in turn, needs to protect price stability. What this means in an environment of elevated volatility and structural change is, however, controversial. Because monetary policy operates with long lags, price stability is typically defined over the medium term, giving central banks some discretion over the extent and length of inflation overshoots that they are willing to tolerate over the short run. This discretion is particularly relevant in the case of supply-side shocks that tend to push prices and output in opposite directions. Stabilising inflation is then no longer equivalent to stabilising output - the divine coincidence of monetary policy disappears. Such shocks therefore imply a trade-off for monetary policy, between inflation and output. The experience of the 1970s suggests that the extent of this trade-off is highly path dependent. A poorly chosen course of action can make attaining price stability significantly more costly in the future. This path dependency puts a heavy weight on the decisions that central banks are taking in response to the challenges we are facing today. For the first time in four decades, central banks need to prove how determined they are to protect price stability. The pandemic and the war are consistently suppressing the level of aggregate supply at a time of strong pent-up demand, leading to sharp price pressures across a large range of goods and services. There are two broad paths central banks can take to deal with current high inflation: one is a path of caution, in line with the view that monetary policy is the wrong medicine to deal with supply shocks. The other path is one of determination. On this path, monetary policy responds more forcefully to the current bout of inflation, even at the risk of lower growth and higher unemployment. This is the ""robust control"" approach to monetary policy that minimises the risks of very bad economic outcomes in the future. Three broad observations speak in favour of central banks choosing the latter path: the uncertainty about the persistence of inflation, the threats to central bank credibility and the potential costs of acting too late. The first observation relates to how central banks should act in the current environment of large uncertainty. William Brainard's well-known attenuation principle suggests that central banks should tread carefully in the face of uncertainty about how their policies are transmitted to the broader economy. There are at least two conceptual cases where the Brainard principle breaks down. One is the existence of the effective lower bound. The best way for central banks to avoid the perils of a liquidity trap is to ease policy swiftly when a disinflationary shock hits the economy in the vicinity of the lower bound. This principle has become a cornerstone of the monetary policy strategies of many central banks, including the ECB. The second case is when there is uncertainty about the persistence of inflation. When the degree of inflation persistence is uncertain, optimal policy prescribes a forceful response to a deviation of inflation from the target to reduce the risks of inflation remaining high for too long. In this case, it is largely irrelevant whether inflation is driven by supply or demand. If a central bank underestimates the persistence of inflation - as most of us have done over the past one-and-a-half years - and if it is slow to adapt its policies as a result, the costs may be substantial. In the current environment, these risks remain significant. Unprecedented pipeline pressures, tight labour markets and the remaining restrictions on aggregate supply threaten to feed an inflationary process that is becoming harder to control the more hesitantly we act on it. About 20 years ago, here in Jackson Hole, Carl Walsh was clear about what this implies for the conduct of monetary policy: to reduce the risks of a Volcker-type policy shock, central banks should conduct policy assuming that inflation is persistent, as the costs of underestimating persistence are higher than those of overestimating it. Such a policy naturally puts a stronger emphasis on incoming data. Two sets of indicators matter most for deciding on the policy adjustment required to restore price stability. One is actual inflation outcomes along the entire pricing chain. These play a more critical role than they would normally do, as they serve as an important reference point for policymakers to evaluate future pipeline pressures, the forces driving inflation persistence and risks of a de-anchoring of inflation expectations. The other is data on the state of the economy to assess how fast supply and demand imbalances are correcting in response to both changes in interest rates and the repercussions of adverse supply-side shocks. At the same time, the nature of inflation uncertainty implies that forward guidance on the future path of short-term interest rates becomes less relevant, or that it even risks adding to volatility rather than reducing it. A key condition for the success of forward guidance in steering expectations over the past decade was a macroeconomic environment characterised by both historically low inflation volatility and the constraints of the effective lower bound. Forward guidance is less appropriate in conditions of high volatility. When shocks are large and frequent, central banks can give no reliable signal about the future path of short-term interest rates, other than the broad direction of travel consistent with a reaction function that is calibrated on the assumption of high inflation persistence. The second observation tilting the trade-off facing monetary policy towards more forceful action relates to central banks' credibility. Our currencies are stable because people trust that we will preserve their purchasing power. For politically independent central banks, establishing and maintaining that trust is an important policy objective in and of itself. Failing to honour this trust may carry large political costs. History is full of examples of high and persistent inflation causing social unrest. Recent events around the world suggest that the current inflation shock is no exception. Sudden and large losses in purchasing power can test even stable democracies. Surveys suggest that the surge in inflation has started to lower trust in our institutions. Young people, in particular, have no living memory of central banks fighting inflation. We are witnessing a steady and sustained rise in medium and long-term inflation expectations in parts of the population that risks increasing inflation persistence beyond the initial shock. In the euro area, consumers' medium-term inflation expectations were firmly anchored at our 2% target throughout the pandemic. According to the most recent data, median expectations are close to 3%, while average expectations have increased from 3% a year ago to almost 5% today. Average long-term inflation expectations of professional forecasters, too, have started to gradually move away from our 2% target. In July, they stood at 2.2%, a historical high. For both consumers and professional forecasters, we are also observing a marked increase in the right tail of the distribution - that is, the share of survey participants who expect inflation to stabilise at levels well above our 2% target. Option prices in financial markets paint a similar picture. In the 1970s, such shifts in the right tail of the distribution preceded shifts in the mean. We broadly know why these shifts happen among consumers who are financially less literate. These consumers predominately form their expectations based on inflation experiences. But for the euro area, the ECB's consumer expectations survey shows that people who are financially more literate and who see themselves as playing a relevant role in actual price and wage-setting have recently revised their medium-term inflation expectations to a larger extent than other survey participants. This is a source of concern. Unlike for consumers who form their expectations based on their experience of inflation, the higher inflation expectations of financially literate people are unlikely to subside if and when inflation starts decelerating. This increases the probability of second-round effects. We cannot say for certain what is behind these upward revisions to inflation expectations. But two potential explanations come to mind. One is that higher medium-term inflation expectations may be the result of a perception that monetary policymakers have reacted too slowly to the current high inflation. A cardinal principle of optimal policy in a situation of above-target inflation is to raise nominal rates by more than the change in expected inflation - the Taylor principle. If real short-term interest rates fail to increase, monetary policy will be ineffective in dealing with high inflation. In the United States, a systematic failure to uphold the Taylor principle was one of the key factors contributing to the persistence of inflation in the 1970s. The second explanation is that higher inflation expectations may reflect more fundamental concerns, possibly related to fiscal and financial dominance, or to the recent review of central banks' monetary policy frameworks that focused more on the challenges of too-low inflation rather than too-high inflation. All these factors may have created perceptions of a higher tolerance for inflation and a stronger desire to stabilise output. Determined action is needed to break these perceptions. If uncertainty about our reaction function is undermining trust in our commitment to securing price stability, a cautious approach to policymaking will no longer be the appropriate course of action. Instead, a politically independent central bank needs to put less weight on stabilising output than it would when inflation expectations are well anchored. Policymakers should also not pause at the first sign of a potential turn in inflationary pressures, such as an easing of supply chain disruptions. Rather, they need to signal their strong determination to bring inflation back to target quickly. This is another key lesson of the 1970s. If the public expects central banks to lower their guard in the face of risks to economic growth - that is, if they abandon their fight against inflation prematurely - then we risk seeing a much sharper correction down the road if inflation becomes entrenched. The third, and closely related, observation that supports a more forceful policy response relates to the potential costs of acting too late - that is, when high inflation has become fundamentally entrenched in expectations, a situation that neither the United States nor the euro area are facing today. In the early 1980s, many central banks had to tolerate large and costly increases in unemployment to restore confidence in the nominal anchor. There are at least three reasons to believe that a similar endeavour could be even more costly today in terms of lost output and employment. One is that our economies have become less interest rate-sensitive over time, meaning that more withdrawal of monetary accommodation would be required for a given desired decline in inflation. The growing importance of intangible capital is partially responsible for this. In the United States, its share in total investment has tripled since 1980. And in the euro area, it has increased from about 12% in 1995 to 23% today. Research finds that intangible capital-intensive firms tend to be net savers because intangible capital is more difficult to mobilise as collateral for bank lending, making the cost of credit less important. These effects are reinforced by the structural shift towards services, which tend to be, on average, less responsive to monetary policy than more capital-intensive sectors, such as manufacturing. The second reason why a de-anchoring of inflation expectations has become more costly relates to the slope of the Phillips curve. There is a wealth of studies that find that the Phillips curve has become flatter over the past few decades. Before the pandemic, a flat Phillips curve meant that central banks could allow the economy to run hot before inflationary pressures would emerge. Today, a flat Phillips curve means that lowering inflation - once it has become entrenched - potentially requires a deep contraction. The third reason concerns the relevant measure of slack. Even if the true slope of the Phillips curve were to be steeper than is suggested by reduced-form estimates, the fact that it is often rather than domestic slack that matters for price-setting reduces the sensitivity of the economy to interest rate changes on a much broader level. The events of the past one-and-a-half years are testimony to the increased relevance of global economic conditions for inflation. In other words, central banks are likely to face a higher sacrifice ratio compared with the 1980s, even if prices were to respond more strongly to changes in domestic economic conditions, as the globalisation of inflation makes it more difficult for central banks to control price pressures. Let me conclude. High inflation has become the dominant concern of citizens in many countries. Both the likelihood and the cost of current high inflation becoming entrenched in expectations are uncomfortably high. In this environment, central banks need to act forcefully. They need to lean with determination against the risk of people starting to doubt the long-term stability of our fiat currencies. Regaining and preserving trust requires us to bring inflation back to target quickly. The longer inflation stays high, the greater the risk that the public will lose confidence in our determination and ability to preserve purchasing power. Trust in our institutions is even more important at a time of major and disruptive structural change that brings about larger, more persistent and more frequent shocks. A reliable nominal anchor eases the transition towards the new equilibrium, and improves the trade-off facing central banks in the future. All in all, therefore, an important lesson from the Great Moderation is that it is also up to central banks whether the challenges we are facing today will lead to the Great Volatility, or whether the pandemic and the war in Ukraine will ultimately be remembered as painful but temporary interruptions of the Great Moderation.

4942,r220827a_SNB,switzerland,2022-08-27,Monetary policy under new constraints: challenges for the Swiss National Bank,jordan,1,"This year's Jackson Hole symposium seeks to reassess the constraints on the economy following the coronavirus pandemic and Russia's attack on Ukraine, with this panel focusing on the monetary policy outlook in particular. The pandemic and the war in Ukraine have fundamentally changed the constraints on conducting monetary policy. In the past, central banks have been constrained by the effective lower bound on interest rates, but at present it is the strong rise in inflation that poses the major challenge. Over the longer term, structural developments such as the decarbonisation of the economy, the high levels of sovereign debt worldwide and potential deglobalisation could shape the economic constraints and lead to heightened inflationary pressure. I begin by looking back at the challenges central banks, and in particular the Swiss National Bank, have had to contend with since the global financial crisis. I will go on to highlight the developments since the pandemic and the outbreak of the war. The second half of my contribution will address in particular why an appropriately defined range for price stability and a narrow mandate are key factors in being able to conduct effective monetary policy over the longer term in an ever-changing environment. Here I will draw especially on the SNB's experience, taking the Swiss perspective of a small open economy with an important currency. In the two decades prior to the global financial crisis, the nominal interest rate level had declined worldwide. On the one hand, central banks' success in combatting inflation, coupled with cheap production opportunities resulting from an increasingly integrated global economy, had led to falling inflation rates. On the other hand, the real rate of interest had declined in many countries due to structural factors such as decreasing productivity growth and the ageing of the population. When the global financial crisis and the associated economic slump required a decisive easing in monetary policy, many central banks quickly reached the zero lower bound on interest rates. To continue to ensure an appropriately expansionary monetary policy in this situation, 'unconventional' measures then had to be introduced. Switzerland, too, was unable to escape these international developments. As a small open economy, in the wake of the financial crisis it was hit hard by the slump in global demand and the turbulence on the international financial markets. Our country's situation was exacerbated by strong upward pressure on the Swiss franc. The rapid pace of the appreciation, and the resulting - at times massive - overvaluation of the Swiss franc, heightened the economic challenges and gave rise to the threat of deflation. On the one hand, the appreciation reduced global demand for goods and services produced in Switzerland, and the associated negative effects on the economy curbed inflation. On the other hand, the appreciation led directly to lower prices for imported consumer goods. Owing to the high share of imports in Switzerland, this weighed additionally on inflation. This pronounced appreciation pressure was attributable to two specific characteristics of Switzerland. First, the traditionally low level of interest rates in Switzerland meant that there was less leeway to the effective lower bound by international comparison. Interest rates in Switzerland are generally lower than abroad since the Swiss franc is valued as a safe investment given Switzerland's long-standing political, fiscal and monetary stability. As central banks lowered interest rates significantly due to the global financial crisis, the interest rate differential between Switzerland and other countries decreased, making the Swiss franc comparatively more attractive. Second, when risk sentiment deteriorates globally, our currency typically gains in value owing to its characteristic as a safe haven. This was especially the case during the financial crisis and the European sovereign debt crisis. Heightened uncertainty worldwide following the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic and Russia's attack on Ukraine also increased upward pressure on the Swiss franc. To ensure price stability over the medium term against this backdrop, the SNB resorted to unconventional measures. We lowered our policy rate well into negative territory and intervened in the foreign exchange market, at times considerably. This led to a marked expansion of our balance sheet (cf. Chart 1). The use of foreign exchange market interventions was necessary given that the strong appreciation of the Swiss franc was a direct source of the deflationary pressure in Switzerland. Furthermore, the scope for buying domestic bonds was limited given Switzerland's relatively small capital market. By lowering our policy rate to .75% and extensively intervening in the foreign exchange market, we were able to ensure price stability even in these difficult years. Although there were phases when inflation slipped into negative territory, it always returned relatively quickly to positive values. There are two points worth noting in this regard. First, the phases of negative inflation did not lead to a de-anchoring of longer-term inflation expectations. These remained consistently between 0% and 2%, i.e. in the range that the SNB equates with price stability. This can be seen in the inflation expectations of companies in Switzerland (cf. Chart 2). Although their short-term expectations tracked the development of inflation, their longer-term expectations remained stable even when inflation was temporarily negative. The companies regarded the recurring phases of negative inflation as one-off events. Although inflation has been very low on average over the past 15 years, companies have not perceived the decline in inflation as a trend. The companies apparently trusted that the SNB would be able to prevent a sustained decline in the level of prices through its decisive use of unconventional measures. The SNB was able to preserve its monetary policy credibility, even in this difficult environment. The second point relates to the adjustment processes following the sudden upward surges in the value of the Swiss franc. The negative or very low inflation in Switzerland was in fact part of these adjustment processes, since it contributed to reducing the overvaluation of the Swiss franc over time. Thus, the real exchange rate appreciated considerably less than the nominal exchange rate (cf. Chart 3). This helped to cushion the impact of the nominal appreciation on the real economy. The economy's ability to adapt to an environment with low - and in some instances negative - inflation has been better than many expected. The Swiss economy has fared relatively well over the past 15 years. The labour market has remained robust overall, and GDP growth has been good by international comparison (cf. Chart 4). Like most other countries, Switzerland was unable to avoid significant declines in GDP amid the global financial crisis and during the pandemic, but each time our economy quickly returned to a growth trajectory. The SNB was able to ensure price stability in the phase marked by deflationary risks, and thus contributed to a comparatively robust development of the economy. Of course, besides the influence of monetary policy, this development of the real economy also reflects structural factors such as the strong resilience of the well-diversified Swiss economy and the flexible labour market. Companies had to make considerable efforts to adapt to the difficult conditions after each appreciation surge, which may have enhanced the flexibility and efficiency of the Swiss economy even further. The increase in the population as a result of immigration made a positive contribution to growth as well. Furthermore, during the pandemic in particular, there was also a rapid and targeted fiscal policy response. The pandemic and the war in Ukraine have fundamentally changed the constraints on central banks. In particular, inflation has risen strongly in many countries over the past year, and uncertainty has also increased markedly in many respects. The SNB, too, is at present confronted with an inflation rate that is significantly above the range we equate with price stability. As in recent years, inflation in Switzerland is currently lower than in many other countries. Besides the strong Swiss franc, the energy mix in Switzerland has thus far also helped to keep inflation comparatively low. Nevertheless, the current level of 3.4% is still the highest inflation our country has seen since the 1990s. Furthermore, there are signs that inflation is increasingly spreading to goods and services that are not directly affected by the pandemic or the war in Ukraine. In fact, it appears that in the current environment, higher prices are being passed on more quickly - and are also being more readily accepted - than was the case until just recently. In conjunction with this, longerterm inflation expectations have also been moving upwards slightly over the past quarters. Furthermore, there are clear indications of wage growth gathering momentum. How is the SNB handling this situation? We already made our initial response to the impending inflationary pressure in the final months of 2021. Both inflation and our inflation forecast at that time were still at a very low level. At our monetary policy assessment in December, we announced that we would allow the Swiss franc to appreciate to a certain extent in nominal terms in order to reduce the inflationary pressure from abroad. The Swiss franc gained around 4% in nominal terms between autumn 2021 and spring 2022, making imports cheaper and so countering the general increase in prices. In June 2022, we then raised the SNB policy rate for the first time in 15 years, by half a percentage point to same time, we signalled that further interest rate moves may be necessary in the foreseeable future. With our policy rate rise, the Swiss franc appreciated further. The need for monetary policy tightening is shown by our conditional inflation forecast of June 2022 (cf. Chart 5). According to this forecast, and assuming that the SNB policy rate remains constant at -0.25%, the rate of inflation will temporarily decline before rising back to 2% over time. Had we not raised our policy rate in June, inflation would very probably have been well above this level over the medium term, and thus persistently outside the range of price stability. Our monetary policy decision in June must also be seen as a weighing-up of various risks. Tightening too soon or too strongly could have stalled economic development, and possibly even led to renewed deflationary risks. In Switzerland's case, however, these factors were clearly outweighed by the risks of tightening too late. Waiting could have necessitated a more abrupt and stronger rate increase at a later date, with the risk of a more severe economic downturn and threats to financial stability. The SNB's experience in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the most recent phase of higher inflation in Switzerland, shows that it can become necessary to pursue a markedly restrictive monetary policy with serious consequences for the real economy once inflation exceeds a certain level. Our substantial change in course at a comparatively early stage regarding the development of inflation, and the fact that we envisaged possible further tightening in the near future, were thus aimed at ensuring price stability over the medium term without placing an excessively heavy burden on the economy. This weighing up of various risks takes place in an environment marked by exceptional uncertainty. What does this uncertainty mean for the SNB? In the immediate term, the uncertainty above all pertains to the interpretation of the data currently available. In making our monetary policy decisions, it is important that we distinguish between temporary and sustained inflationary pressure. The recent rise in inflation may well have been triggered to a large extent by supply shocks with a temporary impact. However, given the difficulty in identifying an increase in sustained inflationary pressure in the current environment, there is the risk of underestimating the persistence of inflation. This is particularly the case because it is still very difficult to assess the impact of the highly expansionary monetary and fiscal policies worldwide in the wake of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. The uncertainty is also reflected in the fact that our economic models may be capturing the current situation less reliably than usual. We have in fact had to repeatedly make upward revisions to our inflation forecast in recent quarters (cf. Chart 6). Models are inherently unable to anticipate either shocks - such as in the case of energy prices - or fundamental shifts in the behaviour of economic agents - such as pricing behaviour - and therefore only capture their impact with a certain time lag. It is very difficult at present to model companies' pricing behaviour due to the lack of experience with rapidly rising inflation. A combination of newer and traditional approaches are helping us to get a better understanding of the current data. On the one hand, micro price data point to Swiss companies having adapted their pricing policy in recent months in line with the higher rate of inflation (cf. Chart 7). For example, there has been an increase in the proportion of goods and services in the Swiss consumer price index with rising prices, whereas the proportion with declining prices has remained virtually constant. On the other hand, our delegates for regional economic relations serve us well. Their one-on-one discussions with companies allow us to better understand price-setting behaviour. These talks show that companies' long-standing reluctance to raise prices has largely disappeared. The change in their behaviour has resulted in prices becoming more flexible overall. This is facilitating the spread of price rises to other categories of goods and services. These findings make it clear that the increase in inflation should not be seen solely as a consequence of the temporary supply shocks triggered by the pandemic and the war. This strengthened our resolve in deciding to react relatively quickly to the rise in inflation. The longer-term outlook for monetary policy is also subject to high uncertainty. Structural factors such as the transition to a greener economy, rising sovereign debt worldwide, the demographic transition and ultimately also the fact that globalisation appears to have peaked - at least temporarily - could lead to persistently higher inflationary pressure in the coming years. In particular, a decline in global economic integration could increase companies' pricesetting power, meaning that they would be able to push through price increases more easily. However, from the current perspective, it is difficult to assess precisely how these structural factors will develop, and how they will influence inflation dynamics. There is further uncertainty with regard to the room for manoeuvre in monetary policy, i.e. the gap between the neutral level of interest and the effective lower bound. After the decades-long decline in interest rates, the question now is whether there are factors that could stop this downward trend, or even turn it around. I am thinking here of factors such as the tendency towards deglobalisation and increased investment in climate protection and defence - all of which could lead to a lasting rise in the need for capital and thus also in interest rate levels globally. What do these considerations mean for the SNB's monetary policy in the post-pandemic era? On the one hand, ensuring price stability must be our absolute priority. On the other hand, we will have to live with a high level of uncertainty over the medium to long term. This applies not only to temporary fluctuations in prices and the economy, but also to the fundamental equilibria in the economy. Structural factors could mean that the environment remains inflationary for a longer period of time. However, strong economic turmoil could quickly put us back at the lower bound on interest rates. The SNB must recognise changes in constraints at an early stage and analyse their impact. The key lies in thinking in terms of scenarios, and - as in a risk management approach - weighing these up against one another. With our monetary policy decisions, we must do our utmost to prevent negative developments. In light of the uncertainty, we must take robust monetary policy decisions that will ensure price stability in a broad range of scenarios. To conduct effective and robust monetary policy in deflationary and inflationary environments alike, in addition to these analytical skills we also need a sensible institutional framework. Amid changing conditions with differing structural inflationary pressure, there are two factors that are particularly important in my opinion with regard to the institutional framework: first, seeking to achieve low inflation while at the same time allowing for a certain amount of leeway; and second, a narrowly defined monetary policy mandate that focuses on maintaining price stability while taking due account of the economic situation. By defining price stability or setting an inflation target, central banks provide an important signal for the general public and the markets. Not least because this determines how quickly and how strongly monetary policy reacts to shocks, or the extent to which the central bank seeks to fine-tune inflation. For a small open economy like Switzerland, we have seen that there are considerable advantages in having a definition of price stability that anchors inflation expectations at a low level while at the same time allowing a certain degree of flexibility with regard to the accepted inflation rates. In our monetary policy strategy, we define price stability as a rise in consumer prices of less than 2% per year. Deflation - that is to say a sustained decrease in the price level - also breaches the objective of price stability. We thus do not have a point target in our definition of price stability, and we do not seek to achieve a specific value between 0% and 2%. Furthermore, the SNB focuses on the medium-term inflation outlook, which means that negative inflation or inflation rates in excess of 2% can also be temporarily permitted. In recent years, there has been intense debate in academic circles and also at central banks on how to best set inflation targets or define price stability. Some central banks have also adjusted their inflation targets. These adjustments have been primarily aimed at reducing potential constraints on the ability to take monetary policy action resulting from the low interest rate environment. Would adjusting the definition of price stability also make sense for the SNB? We are firmly convinced that our definition of price stability has proved its worth, even under the difficult circumstances of the past 15 years. We also regard our definition as a particular advantage in the post-pandemic phase, with its heightened uncertainty regarding structural equilibria. Why is this so? And how can three adjustments that have been discussed internationally be put in context against the backdrop of the specific situation in Switzerland and our definition of price stability? The first possible adjustment relates to the level of the inflation target. A credible higher inflation target would lead to both an increase in expected and realised inflation. The consequence would be higher average nominal interest rates, which would reduce the likelihood of the effective lower bound being reached. As a result, unconventional measures - in our case primarily foreign exchange market interventions - would need to be used less frequently. Why do we not aim for a higher rate of inflation? We do not believe a higher inflation target would truly free us from the problem of the effective lower bound. It would take a significantly higher inflation target to sustainably lift interest rates from the lower bound. However, such a target would no longer be compatible with our statutory mandate to ensure price stability. Furthermore, it would not tally with the pronounced preference of the Swiss people for low inflation. Higher rates of inflation would be neither understood nor accepted in Switzerland. A survey of more than 400 Swiss companies in the first half of 2022 showed a large majority in favour of low inflation, by which they typically mean a rate between 0% and 2% (cf. Chart 8). We do not have similar surveys of households, but it is safe to assume that they would likely favour even lower inflation. The public reaction to the recent rise in inflation clearly demonstrates that there would be little understanding among the general population for a higher targeted rate of inflation. A second possible adjustment would be to target an average inflation rate over a given period. Overshooting and undershooting inflation rates would have to be compensated for over time. This could better stabilise longer-term inflation expectations in that the aim would be a steady development in the level of prices. Why do we not compensate for past deviations from price stability? The Swiss economy has proven in the past that it can deal well with temporary inflation shocks, and that longer-term inflation expectations are well anchored. Compensating for past deviations from a targeted average value would only be possible with massive additional volatility in prices and output, especially given the strong global shocks to which Switzerland is exposed. Such an approach would also find little acceptance among the general public. The third possible adjustment relates to the choice of a point target instead of a range when defining price stability. This could help anchor inflation expectations more precisely and thus better stabilise inflation. Why do we refrain from adopting a point target? Having such a precise goal would unnecessarily complicate monetary policy implementation for the SNB. Our definition of price stability as a range enables us to continually weigh up the costs and benefits of our monetary policy measures. Doing so allows us to vary our inflation tolerance within the range consistent with price stability in line with the situation at hand. We can thus let inflation persist at the upper or lower end of this range for a longer period, without losing credibility. In particular, this allows us to better absorb different global inflation regimes. For example, we can live with inflation in the lower part of our price stability range over a longer period in an environment of increasing globalisation. Likewise, in an environment of shrinking global supply, we can accept inflation in the upper part of the range. Added to this, our medium-term focus allows us to be flexible in reacting to larger surges in inflation or deflation, and to take the costs of restoring price stability into consideration. The developments in recent years show that a 2% point target for inflation in Switzerland would have required significantly stronger monetary policy easing measures. This would not have been proportionate from a cost-benefit perspective. Our definition of price stability is thus also a sign of pragmatism and realism. A certain tolerance of inflation rate fluctuations is necessary, especially for a small open economy like Switzerland that is constantly exposed to disruptions from abroad. Our experience shows that it is virtually impossible to fine-tune inflation. Remaining realistic in our targets ultimately benefits our credibility. Realism and flexibility do not contradict our clear task of ensuring price stability over the medium term. On the one hand, our price stability range is set comparatively low and forms an anchor for low inflation expectations. On the other hand, we have repeatedly proved that we are prepared to act decisively if price stability is at threat. The preference for low inflation and the Swiss franc's role as a safe haven could see the SNB policy rate reaching the effective lower bound again in future. Unconventional monetary policy instruments are thus likely to continue to have an important part to play in Switzerland going forward. Even a somewhat higher level of interest rates worldwide is unlikely to change this. Our definition of price stability has proved its worth for Switzerland as a small open economy with an internationally important currency. However, the definition that is best suited to the successful pursuit of monetary policy will vary from country to country. Besides the definition of price stability, effective monetary policy over the long term also hinges on a narrow central bank mandate. In recent years, some in politics and among the public have time and again looked to central banks with regard to issues that go beyond the core task of monetary policy, namely price stability. Central banks have come under pressure to interpret their mandate more broadly and take on new tasks. And in some cases there is also a willingness among central banks themselves to adopt a looser interpretation of their existing mandates. This tendency has strengthened noticeably of late. In our case, for example, there have been a series of motions in parliament calling on the SNB to do more with regard to climate protection. The same applies to the issue of inequality, ever since the use of central bank balance sheets to tackle the global financial crisis has increasingly raised questions regarding the redistribution of wealth. Time and again, there have been initiatives from politicians demanding that central banks directly finance government tasks. For example, a popular initiative was recently launched in Switzerland seeking to amend the Federal Constitution to give the SNB a direct role in financing the national pension scheme. How is the SNB to deal with these demands? All these concerns - from climate protection to the redistribution of wealth and securing pension provision - are important matters that are rightfully being raised. That said, I am convinced that attempting to solve these issues with monetary policy instruments would entail a significant threat to the effectiveness of monetary policy over the medium to long term. The SNB naturally has to take into account the influence that changes in the economic structure have on inflation. For example, climate change can have an effect on potential growth, and this has to be considered when setting the monetary policy stance. However, the mandate of a central bank must not be overburdened. And doing so would not even help address the various issues in any case. I see three main reasons to support this view. First, central banks do not have effective instruments for successfully pursuing structural policy objectives such as tackling climate change over the long term. Their tools are designed to influence factors relevant for monetary policy, such as interest rates and exchange rates. By contrast, the influence of our investment policy on the global financing conditions for 'green' or 'brown' companies over the long term, for example, is low. While buying green investments may increase their price, when we sell the corresponding securities for monetary policy reasons, their market price will decline again. When it comes to inequality, again central banks do not have the instruments to bring about lasting change beyond the positive impact of a stability-oriented monetary policy. An expansionary monetary policy may mitigate income inequality in the short term in that it provides support to low-income households in particular or promotes the creation of jobs in the low-wage sector. However, an expansionary monetary policy also stimulates asset prices, which then tends to exacerbate wealth inequality. The biggest problem for the more vulnerable sections of society that central banks can influence is inflation. Concentrating on price stability thus inherently constitutes the greatest contribution a central bank can make to social cohesion. While central banks do not have effective instruments for achieving structural policy objectives, other state institutions do, for example in the form of fiscal policy and regulatory measures. If central banks assume responsibility for such objectives, there is a serious danger of other state institutions refraining from taking necessary and effective - but potentially unpopular - measures to achieve these goals. Expanding the monetary policy mandate can therefore be counterproductive. Second, a broad mandate can blur the clear focus of monetary policy on price stability and create unnecessary conflicts of interest. This can in turn give rise to doubts as to whether the central bank is at all times taking the necessary measures to ensure price stability. Such doubts can ultimately weaken the anchoring of inflation expectations, and so make conducting monetary policy more difficult. And third, a broad mandate or one that is interpreted too broadly can jeopardise the independence of a central bank over time. Even if central banks did have suitable instruments at their disposal, taking steps to address climate protection or wealth redistribution is a political decision. When it comes to matters of a political nature, the democratic process is essential and must not be circumvented by broadening the interpretation of the central bank's mandate. Independence also requires accountability, and rendering proper account is only possible if the objectives entrusted to the central bank can be achieved within a reasonable timeframe. Independence can only be legitimised if the central bank has a narrowly defined mandate that it can achieve and can then give due account of having done so. The independence of a central bank is not a law of nature, nor is it something that can be taken for granted politically. Rather, it exists because the public is convinced that price stability is a sensible objective that can best be ensured over the long term by delegating the responsibility to an independent central bank. This conviction is in turn based on solid scientific evidence. Independence in areas that go beyond a narrowly defined mandate is not democratically acceptable, nor does it have any scientific foundation. If the mandate is interpreted too broadly, or if legislators expand it beyond the core task of price stability, over time this will inevitably lead to public debate. Broader action by central banks might initially be welcomed by politicians and the general public, but that can quickly turn in the opposite direction. Overall, this would ultimately also entail the risk of constraints on the central bank's independence in conducting monetary policy. Central banks should therefore advocate a narrowly defined mandate, and should not take on any tasks that require political decisions and for which they do not have effective instruments. The institutional framework in Switzerland tallies with these principles. The Constitution and law entrust the SNB, as an independent central bank, with the pursuit of monetary policy in the overall interests of the country. In order to legitimise its independence, the SNB has a clearly defined, narrow mandate that compels it to focus on ensuring price stability while taking due account of economic developments. Furthermore, the SNB is obliged to give full account of its actions. This serves to make its decisions readily understandable for the general public, and to show whether and to what extent the targets have been met. The phrase 'the overall interests of the country' means that monetary policy is to be focused on the economy as a whole, rather than individual interests. It does not provide a basis for pursuing other objectives with monetary policy, even if the desired goals - as in the case of climate protection - are right and important for society. The SNB will remain committed to maintaining the current institutional framework in the future. Price stability is the most important contribution monetary policy can make with regard to growth and prosperity. This can also be seen in the current situation. High inflation has quickly pushed other important problems down the list of societal and political priorities. Ensuring price stability is thus also a prerequisite for successfully tackling other challenges facing society. The environment in which we conduct our monetary policy has changed. In recent years we have been concerned about inflation being too low; now we are concerned about it being too high.

7673,r220829a_FOMC,united states,2022-08-29,Progress on Fast Payments for All: An Update on FedNow,brainard,0,"With the technical particularly thank the early adopters for the important investments they are making to prepare for the day when the FedNow Service goes live next year. Together with our partners, we will be ready to launch the FedNow Service between May and July of 2023, bringing this innovative core instant payment infrastructure to financial institutions of every size across America. We have been working hard to deliver on time, but ultimately the number of American businesses and households that are able to access instant payments will depend on financial services providers making the necessary investments to upgrade our payments infrastructure. Together, we can ensure that all Americans have access to a modern and reliable instant payment system. The payment system is a critical part of America's infrastructure that touches everyone. Americans rely on the payment system all day every day to make purchases, pay bills, and get paid--without ever needing to consider the complex infrastructure that is operating under the hood. American households and businesses want and deserve payment transactions that work seamlessly, reliably, and efficiently. Fostering a safe, efficient, and widely accessible payments infrastructure has been a central part of the Fed's mission since the very beginning. The Federal Reserve Banks all around the country have provided payment and settlement services alongside the private sector for more than 100 years. Over that period, we have repeatedly innovated and invested in collaboration with the private sector to transform the payment system,  using the latest technology to better meet the needs of businesses and households. after extensive industry engagement and planning, the Federal Reserve is on track to The FedNow Service will transform the way everyday payments are made throughout the economy, bringing substantial gains to households and businesses through the ability to send instant payments at any time on any day, and the funds being immediately available to recipients to make other payments or manage cash flow efficiently. Immediate availability of funds could be especially important for households managing their finances paycheck to paycheck or small businesses with cash flow constraints. Having the capacity to manage money in real time could help households avoid costly late payment fees or free up working capital for small businesses to finance growth. Indeed, during the pandemic, we witnessed how essential rapid access to funds can be, as many households started spending emergency relief payments on the day they were received. To deliver on the promise of a payment system for the future, the Federal Reserve has made a substantial commitment to the FedNow platform, which has benefited from the innovative technologies and approaches proven by global technology companies that are vital for today's always on digital economy. Our cloud-first design, unique among central bank instant payment services, positions us for the future by enabling not only the  throughput and scalability required for high-volume retail transactions but also broad geographic points of resiliency to ensure continuous service. Cloud-first design affords other key technology components such as self-healing processes and automation, which add to operational resiliency. And our development processes are agile, allowing us to deliver new features faster to financial institutions of all sizes as they are ready to adopt them based on their priorities. We have also invested heavily in stakeholder engagement to ensure readiness for service adoption through efforts like the pilot program, the FedNow Explorer resource, To advance the goal of nationwide reach for instant payments, we have worked closely with the private-sector RTP instant payment service on message specifications to ensure alignment in support of routing interoperability. Just as the Federal Reserve has made a substantial commitment to our new instant payment infrastructure, we are calling on industry stakeholders to do the same. The shift to real-time payment infrastructure requires a focused effort, but the shift is inevitable. The time is now for all key stakeholders--financial institutions, core service providers, software companies, and application developers--to devote the resources necessary to support instant payments. This means upgrading back-office processes, evaluating accounting procedures to accommodate a seven-business-day week, arranging liquidity providers, deploying a new customer-facing application, and promoting instant payments for key use cases to customers. As the service providers featured at this event will  demonstrate in the coming days, parts of the industry have already seized on the opportunity to build new services and capabilities that support instant payments. These efforts will increase competition in the market for end-user services and promote innovation--key benefits from providing the FedNow Service as a neutral platform, accessible to financial institutions of all sizes nationwide. I would like to personally thank our early adopters. The input that you have provided has been instrumental for our team as they have designed and built the service, and the time and energy that you have committed to this effort is important for a successful launch. I want to call on additional banks and core service providers to join your commitment to prepare for adoption of the FedNow Service. This time next year, I hope we can all have a great sense of accomplishment in our shared effort to transform America's payment system for the digital era.","['payments', 'banks', 'bank', 'payment', 'fed']","['payment infrastructure', 'payments infrastructure', 'instant payments', 'instant payment', 'payment services']","['instant payment infrastructure', 'payment infrastructure financial', 'instant payments efforts', 'payments infrastructure ensure', 'payment infrastructure requires']","['new instant payment infrastructure', 'innovative core instant payment infrastructure', 'payments infrastructure', 'reliable instant payment system', 'instant payment services']"
3229,r220829a_ECB,euro area,2022-08-29,Monetary policy in the euro area: the next phase,lane,0,"The period December 2021 to July 2022 constituted a distinct first phase in the normalisation of the monetary policy of the ECB. Starting with the announcement that net purchases under the pandemic emergency programme (PEPP) would conclude in March 2022 and followed by the curtailment and the eventual cessation of net purchases under the asset purchase programme (APP) by the start of the third quarter, this phase was completed with the lifting of the key policy rates out of negative territory at the July meeting. This period saw a remarkable regime change in the behaviour of the euro area yield curve, with a very significant upward shift and an increase in volatility, as markets responded to the implications of the new inflation and cyclical environment for the future path for monetary policy, including the exit from ""lower bound"" monetary policy calibration. Having completed this initial stage of monetary policy normalisation, our upcoming September monetary policy meeting will be the start of a new phase. Our over-riding goal is to make sure that monetary policy will deliver the timely return of inflation to our medium-term two per cent target. In terms of execution, this new phase will consist of a meeting-by-meeting (MBM) approach to setting interest rates. At a basic level, the transition from rate forward guidance to the MBM approach is in line with our monetary policy strategy, which assessed that forward guidance was primarily an appropriate response to the lower bound constraint. As policy rates move away from the lower bound, the inherent flexibility of the MBM approach is better suited to calibrating monetary policy in a highly uncertain environment. Since monetary policy works through its influence on the entire yield curve, it is important to appreciate that MBM monetary policy essentially has two elements. First, it allows for meeting-by-meeting re-assessments of the conditionally-expected medium-term path for interest rates that is required to deliver the two per cent target, in line with the incoming data and evolving outlook. The terminal rate over the projection horizon is widely used as a short-hand summary indicator for the orientation of interest rate policy. It follows that a primary influence on the interest rate decision in any one meeting is the size of the gap between the prevailing interest rate and the assessed terminal rate. Second, at a tactical level, the exact calibration of the interest rate decision should also take into account the appropriate speed to close that gap. Especially under conditions of high uncertainty, each of these factors can shift in a material way from one meeting to the next: first, there may be a revision in the projected terminal rate; and, second, the appropriate speed in closing the gap may accelerate or decelerate. To state the obvious, the current zero value of the policy rate (taking the deposit facility rate as the relevant policy rate in conditions of excess liquidity) is below any calculation of the appropriate terminal rate. Our July monetary policy statement signalled that further normalisation of interest rates will be appropriate: the scale and timeline of rate adjustment will be determined by the evolution of the terminal rate and the appropriate speed in closing the gap between the current rate and the terminal rate. In anticipation of further interest rate hikes towards the terminal rate, the euro area yield curve is much higher than the current policy rate, such that the extent of monetary tightening that has already occurred is far greater than the July first step in raising the policy rate. In assessing the terminal rate, both structural and cyclical factors are relevant. In the long-term steady state (with no shocks hitting the economy), the equilibrium nominal risk-free interest rate will be the sum of the two per cent inflation target and the long-term equilibrium risk-free real interest rate. However, within the medium-term horizon of monetary policy, time-varying cyclical factors may require interest rates to move above or below that long-term equilibrium level in order for inflation to stabilise at two per cent. It follows that, meeting-by-meeting, an important element of the monetary policy debate will be the discussion of our latest assessment of the appropriate terminal rate that takes into account the evolution of cyclical factors, in addition to assessing a potential role of structural forces in shifting the underlying long-term equilibrium real interest rate. In terms of understanding the interplay of cyclical factors, there are no shortcuts in following a data-dependent approach. It is essential to maintain an integrated analytical framework that jointly analyses the inflation cycle, the economic cycle and the financial cycle, in recognition of the interactions and inter-dependencies across economic, monetary and financial developments in determining the dynamics of nominal and real variables. This integrated framework is a cornerstone of our monetary policy strategy and guides the preparation of each monetary policy meeting, especially in the quarterly meetings in which new staff macroeconomic projections are presented together with comprehensive reports on monetary and financial developments. The over-riding focus of this analytical work is to make sure that monetary policy is calibrated to counter the cyclical forces that threaten the timely delivery of our two per cent inflation target. Let me highlight some of the major open questions about current cyclical conditions. The over-riding cyclical feature is that inflation is currently very far above the two per cent target, with the prospect of a prolonged phase before inflation returns to the neighbourhood of the target. In particular, inflation is expected to remain high in the near term primarily due to the further upward pressure on the costs for energy (especially gas and electricity) and food over the summer, together with the ongoing pass-through to retail prices of input cost increases incurred in the earlier stages of production chains. At a mechanical level, the combination of base effects, the easing of supply bottlenecks and the completion of the re-opening phase of the pandemic recovery will contribute to inflation falling back over time from its current extremely-high levels. However, the monetary policy challenge is to assess the strength and persistence of the cyclical adjustment dynamics to these high inflation rates that, if left unattended, could result in an unacceptably-delayed return to the two per cent inflation target, with the associated risk that inflation that remains too high for too long could de-anchor long-term inflation expectations. In particular, the wider economic cycle will play a critical role in determining the responses of price setters and wage setters to the currently-high inflation rates. Firms that have experienced declines in profit margins due to rising input costs and workers that have suffered a reduction in living standards due to the sharp increase in consumer prices will seek to restore the real value of their earnings and incomes. However, the wider economic cycle imposes constraints on the speed and the extent to which these adjustments can take place in a sustainable manner. In particular, a deterioration in the economic cycle would limit the capacity of firms to raise prices without suffering a loss of business and the capacity of workers to obtain wage increases without suffering a reduction in employment levels. The toll of unexpectedly-high inflation on real incomes and the real value of accumulated savings, the significant deterioration in the terms of trade (especially since so much energy is imported), the high intrinsic uncertainty associated with the Russian war on Ukraine (both in relation to energy and food costs and geo-political stability), the slowdown in the world economy and the tightening in global and domestic financial conditions that has already occurred all constitute significant economic headwinds for the euro area. At the same time, all else equal, the recovery in labour market conditions that has occurred should support faster nominal wage increases, as has already been evident (albeit only to a moderate extent) in the course of this year. Taken together, these forces suggest that cyclical inflation forces will be subject to push-pull dynamics. In one direction, the catch up adjustment of prices and wages to the steep cost increases that have already occurred constitutes a source of intrinsic persistence that, if excessive, could generate an unacceptable delay in the return of inflation to the two per cent target. In the other direction, the deterioration in the economic cycle will weaken the capacity of firms and workers to increase prices and wages in a sustainable manner. In turn, the meeting-by-meeting re-assessment of the appropriate terminal rate will reflect the implications of the incoming data for the relative strength of these opposing adjustment forces, together of course with the incidence of any further inflation shocks. Turning to the appropriate speed in closing the gap between the prevailing policy rate and the appropriate terminal rate, it is important to appreciate that the middle and longer segments of the yield curve, which are most important for determining financing conditions in the economy, are much more sensitive to the expected terminal rate than to the precise timeline for converging to the terminal rate. A steady pace (that is neither too slow nor too fast) in closing the gap to the terminal rate is important for several reasons. First, there is uncertainty about the transmission of policy rate changes to overall financing conditions, such that it makes sense to allow the financial system to absorb rate changes in a step-by-step manner. In particular, the same cumulative rate hike over a fixed interval is less likely to generate adverse feedback loops (that in turn could pose new risks to price stability) if it takes the form of a multi-step calibrated series rather than a smaller number of larger rate increases. Of course, in calibrating a multi-step series, the appropriate size of the individual increments will be larger the wider the gap to the terminal rate and the more skewed the risks to the inflation target. Second, the current high uncertainty about inflation dynamics and monetary policy transmission means that a multi-step adjustment path towards the terminal rate also makes it easier to undertake mid-course corrections if circumstances change. While upside risks to inflation are currently more intense than downside risks, if the incoming data (new shocks, updates on the relative strength of opposing adjustment forces) call for a downward shift in the terminal rate, this would be easier to handle under a step-by-step approach. Such risks not only include downside scenarios to the economic outlook but also external factors that could tighten financing conditions independently of domestic monetary policy actions (such as the spillover impact of monetary policy tightening in other countries or shifts in risk sentiment in global markets). For this reason, even if the general direction of monetary policy is shaped not only by the centre of the risk distribution but also by the current net upside skew, the agility to adjust the scale and speed of interest rate hikes remains vitally important. The incoming data on inflation expectations play an important role in our integrated assessment of economic, monetary and financial conditions. All sources -- market-based data, the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF), the Survey of Monetary Analysts (SMA), the Consumer Expectations Survey (CES), the partial data on firm-level expectations from the Corporate Telephone Survey (CTS), the Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises (SAFE) and national sources, the surveys of the European Commission, and a range of external surveys -- are closely examined in relation to the formation of near-term, medium-term, and long-term inflation expectations. We also assess, where available, expectations about macroeconomic indicators (and the reported individual prospects of the surveyed households and firms). Even under scenarios in which long-term inflation expectations are firmly anchored, the evolution of near-term and medium-term inflation expectations and macroeconomic expectations play important roles in determining inflation and macroeconomic dynamics over these horizons. Clearly, the worst-case scenario would be characterised by the de-anchoring of long-term inflation expectations, which would be very costly to fix. Except under very artificial model specifications, inflation outcomes and macroeconomic outcomes will be important factors in determining inflation expectations and macroeconomic expectations, as individuals update their beliefs based on realised inflation and economic developments. By and large, the market-based indicators of inflation compensation and the expert surveys indicate that long-term inflation expectations remain close to the two per cent target, while near-term inflation expectations are quite elevated. In the CES, the medium-term inflation expectations of households also remain well below the near-term inflation expectations. Across all available sources, macroeconomic expectations (and prospects at the individual level) suggest a high degree of concern about a potential economic slowdown, a general recognition that supply shocks will generate both near-term inflation surges and a decline in the economic outlook, which in turn will constrain the persistence of inflation. This profile is consistent with a profile in which market participants, experts and households broadly understand (albeit to varying degrees) that supply shocks and temporary factors have pushed inflation up to the current high levels but that these factors are expected to fade over time, reinforced by the understanding that monetary policy actions (as captured by the expectations of substantial rate hikes in the coming months) will ensure the return of inflation to target. In terms of the feedback loop from inflation expectations to nominal and real dynamics, it is important to appreciate that, for any given nominal yield curve, if high near-time inflation expectations are accompanied by expectations of a deteriorated macroeconomic outlook and significant uncertainty then the inflation cycle is less likely to be amplified through an endogenous increase in consumption, investment and credit compared to an alternative scenario in which high near-term inflation expectations are accompanied by macroeconomic optimism. Put differently, cost-push inflation shocks are less likely to give rise to a pro-cyclical real interest rate channel compared to demand-driven inflation shocks. At the same time, market-based indicators of inflation risk and the right-tail of responses in the expert and household surveys also clearly show that the risk of inflation not returning to target in a timely manner is priced by market participants and feared by some survey respondents. As indicated in our recent monetary policy statements, such above-target revisions to some indicators of longer-term inflation expectations warrant close monitoring. In tracking these right-tail indicators, two conjectures are especially relevant. In one direction, more attentive traders, experts and individuals may identify more quickly a persistent shift in inflation dynamics, while inattentive participants adjust more slowly. Under such scenarios, as highlighted in the pioneering work of Ricardo Reis, right-tail measures will be leading indicators for a generalised revision in long-term inflation expectations. However, under other scenarios, the right tail might be populated by those who over-react to high spot inflation readings and mis-perceive as permanent what turns out to be a temporary increase in the inflation rate. In these scenarios, the right-tail will not serve as an accurate leading indicator of generalised long-term inflation expectations. Accordingly, the interpretation of right-tail measures is closely bound to the general analysis of the relative contribution of temporary and persistent forces in inflation dynamics. Finally, the meeting-by-meeting approach to monetary policy certainly poses communication challenges for central banks. Directional and qualitative communication about the gap between the current policy rate and the terminal rate can foster market dynamics that reinforce and underpin the desired monetary policy stance. However, it is debatable whether more quantitative signalling of the meeting-by-meeting assessment of the prevailing terminal rate is necessary or helpful. The open status of this issue is reflected in the range of approaches across central banks, from those that emphasise the value of reporting their expected future path of rate decisions to those (including the ECB) that just incorporate the observed market yield curve as an external benchmark. While, in principle, communicating the most likely path for future rate hikes could be an effective monetary policy tool, the potential downside is that it adds to the complexity of communications, especially if there are material revisions to the expected policy path from one meeting to the next. There are two clear communication priorities. First, especially when inflation is both high and expected to remain above target for an extended period, the central bank must provide the re-assurance that it has the capability and determination to deliver its price stability mandate. For the ECB, our symmetric two per cent inflation target provides a clear, unambiguous anchor and our monetary policy decisions should be forcefully explained as ensuring the delivery of our target over the medium term. Second, the highly uncertain environment means that, more than ever, the ECB should offer clear and comprehensive explanations of our meeting-by-meeting integrated assessments of the evolving outlook for economic, monetary and financial developments, with a particular focus in explaining how the incoming data are incorporated into our views on the central likelihoods and risk patterns for near-term and medium-term inflation dynamics and thereby shape our monetary policy decisions.","['monetary', 'macroeconomic', 'inflation', 'euro', 'ecb']","['monetary policy', 'stage monetary', 'approach monetary', 'horizon monetary', 'september monetary']","['stage monetary policy', 'monetary policy ecb', 'monetary policy meeting', 'july monetary policy', 'approach monetary policy']","['monetary policy meeting', 'monetary policy strategy', 'monetary policy challenge', 'monetary policy actions', 'monetary policy']"
4599,r220831a_SRB,sweden,2022-08-31,From 500 per cent to −0.5 per cent – what is next?,breman,0,"On the afternoon of 16 September 1992, my teacher Conny came into our class and exclaimed: ""The Riksbank has raised its policy rate to 500 per cent"". I said spontaneously ""no"" - I did not believe him. I studied the science programme at upper secondary school and thought I was good at maths, and an interest rate of 500% was something no one could pay. I started to contradict him. But the teacher insisted he was right - and so he was. The Riksbank had raised its policy rate to 500 per cent in an attempt to defend the fixed exchange rate. This sparked an interest that led me to study Economics at university a few years later. The so-called 1990s crisis fundamentally changed Sweden. It led to a series of reforms that we are still living with today: the inflation target, the fiscal policy framework and the Industrial Agreement. At present, the economic policy framework, and not least the inflation target, is being put to the test. Recently, a number of global shocks - the coronavirus pandemic, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and lock-downs in China - have contributed to pushing up inflation in Sweden and around the world, to levels we have not seen since the early 1990s. I think it is of the utmost importance that we defend the inflation target as anchor for price setting and wage formation in Sweden. Inflation is too high. It is painfully high for both households and companies. In addition to worrying about rising prices, households and companies are worried about higher interest rates. Will we go from 500 per cent to -0.5 per cent to - well, what comes next? It is clear that further increases in the policy rate are required for inflation to return to the target. I will return to this later. But let me say now, that I am confident that the Riksbank will do what is needed to attain the inflation target. In contrast to the early 1990s, we now have a better mandate and a constitutional independence that enable us to take decisive action to attain the target. However, this must not lead us to underestimate the challenges we are facing. New vulnerabilities have been built up over the past 30 years: High indebtedness among households and businesses , housing shortages, a divided labour market and a lack of investment in, for instance, defence, infrastructure, and climate transition. This means that the tightening will severely affect some households and businesses, while higher interest rates risk making necessary investments more difficult and costly. Today, therefore, I would like to invite you to discuss the economic policy framework. Is it possible to complement or modernise the framework to reduce known vulnerabilities while enabling investments that boost long-run potential growth and prosperity, and help alleviate some of the supply-side problems that contribute to high inflation? To give us a good foundation to start from, I would like to begin by briefly summarising what happened in the 1990s and how the economy has changed since then. We are living in dramatic times: A recent pandemic, war in Ukraine and inflation that has risen sharply around the world. One similarity between then and now is the major geopolitical drama. Then, there were revolutionary events such as the reunification of Germany in October 1990, the Kuwait war, the wars in former Yugoslavia which started in 1991, and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December of the same year. The political events made their mark on economic developments. I have often thought of the 1990s crisis as a domestic financial crisis. However, it is important to remember that it was a series of international events, combined with weak domestic economic policy frameworks, that made the crisis deep and prolonged. Let me briefly give some background. The German reunification, which created a local German boom and inflation that caused the Bundesbank to raise its policy rate, had a particularly strong international impact. This attracted large amounts of capital to Germany as investors in other countries sought the high return on the German capital market. This in turn led to an increase in tensions within the European exchange rate mechanism, the ERM. Other ERM countries were forced to raise their policy rates to maintain the exchange rate parities, despite the fact that this worsened the already weak economic activity there. In Sweden we had not created systems that could withstand the pressure this entailed for the Swedish economy. In the mid-1980s, Sweden had begun to phase out the outdated and inefficient regulation system for credit markets. Deregulation was perceived at that time more as a technical measure that was structurally necessary, but the effects on the macroeconomy came to be much greater than most policymakers back then had anticipated. Neither lenders nor borrowers were used to managing the risks in a deregulated environment and lending grew too strongly. The fact that currency regulation was still in place meant that Swedish investors were largely dependent on the domestic asset markets, where prices were soaring. In addition, the tax rules meant that the impact of interest expenses was reduced, which would change with the tax reform in 1990-91. Moreover, there was a strong domestic inflation trend with price and wage spirals, which had long been something of a structural problem in the Swedish economy. The combination of high inflation, high inflation expectations and the design of the tax system meant that the interest rate after tax and inflation was negative for many investors and households, which of course made it tempting to take out a loan. Stabilisation policy was not sufficiently strict to dampen lending, and so the economy was heading toward overheating in the late 1980s. In 1990-91, there was a substantial reversal in the real interest rate, for several reasons. German reunification pushed international interest rates upwards, foreign exchange market unrest forced the Riksbank and central banks in the ERM countries to raise their policy rates to defend their respective exchange rates, and the tax reform in 1990-91 made it more expensive to borrow. From having been negative, the real interest rate rose in a short time to around 5 per cent, in what has been called the 'real interest rate shock'. This reversal shook up the financial system, property prices fell and a combined financial, banking and property crisis broke out. The start is usually considered to be 3 October 1990, when financial company Nyckeln suspended payments and in its fall took with it both other financial companies and banks. This also had repercussions for the real economy, and Sweden entered a deep recession. The growing public finance deficits, rising scepticism about the prospects to reverse developments, the problems in the financial sector, rising unemployment and the high cost situation all combined to undermine the confidence of the financial markets in the Swedish economy and the currency. In late summer 1992, the situation in the Swedish economy was, to say the least, worrying. The last week of August, that is, almost exactly thirty years ago, the turbulence in foreign exchange markets intensified. Currency began to flow out of the country, market interest rates rose and on 26 August the Riksbank raised the marginal interest rate (the policy rate of the time) by three percentage points to 16 per cent. This was only one of several rate increases in the coming weeks. Finland, which had been particularly affected by the collapse of the Soviet Union, chose to move to a floating exchange rate on 8 September. On the same day, the policy rate in Sweden was raised to 24 per cent and the following day it was raised to 75 per cent. An attempt to reduce interest rates to 20 per cent on 14 September did not succeed. In a final attempt to stop the currency outflow, the Riksbank first raised its policy rate to 75 per cent again on 16 September 1992 and then, at 15:20 on the same day, to 500 per cent. At the same time, the pound sterling left the ERM and was allowed to float freely, and the band for tolerated variations of the Italian lira was widened considerably. In this situation, the government and the opposition managed to agree on a crisis package that was presented on 20 September, intended to strengthen the state budget by SEK 40-45 billion. The Riksbank then cut the rate to 50 per cent. After a second crisis package at the end of the month, the interest rate could be cut further, to 24 per cent. This calmed the market somewhat and the Riksbank was able to gradually lower the marginal rate to 11.5 percent in the late autumn. However, the calm was only temporary. In mid-November, the outflow of foreign currency began to accelerate again. Repeating the same manoeuvre with a substantial rate increase and further crisis packages was considered pointless - confidence had been exhausted. On 19 November 1992, the Riksbank abandoned the fixed exchange rate. When you go through the press cuttings from this period, it is not very difficult to see an image of how we were desperately using rate increases and hastily concocted fiscal policy agreements in an attempt to patch up and repair a house that was really so run down that it needed to be completely renovated. But it was now nevertheless clear that it was a total renovation that was needed. In the Swedish paper Dagens Nyheter on 20 November - the day after the defence of the fixed exchange rate was abandoned - it was announced that an expert group had been appointed with Professor Assar Lindbeck as chairman. The aim was to tackle the long-term economic problems and, in Assar's words, to try to answer the question: ""What is it about the Swedish economy that makes it run out of control like this?"" The group, which came to be called the Lindbeck Commission, was to present proposals for how to tackle problems, which Assar described as ""the low growth rate, the exploding public expenditure, the budget deficits, the constant trends towards cost inflation and the slow productivity Unfortunately, it often seems that a crisis is needed to bring about real and profound changes. The major changes in the economic policy frameworks that we made as a result of the crisis in the early 1990s are well known so I will only mention them briefly here. The inflation target Instead of defending a fixed exchange rate, the task of monetary policy from now on would be to keep inflation low and stable. In January 1993, the Riksbank announced that an inflation target of 2 per cent would enter into force with effect from 1 January 1995. Gradually, changes in the monetary policy framework confirmed the new order. The price stability target was written into the law in 1999, at the same time as monetary policy decisions were delegated to an independent The fiscal policy framework For its part, fiscal policy would focus considerably more than previously on keeping public finances in good condition so as to maintain market confidence. The budget process was changed so that it would be easier to gain control over government spending, while public net lending would, on average, be positive through the so-called surplus target. The purpose of the latter was, of course, in the long run to get rid of the rampant government debt and to restore confidence in public finances. Swedish wage-formation also changed. It now works in a completely different way than in the 1970s and 1980s. One important reform was the so-called Industrial Agreement in 1997, under which the manufacturing industry has set the benchmark for wage negotiations and ultimately steered wage cost increases in the entire economy for almost twenty-five years. The 'total renovation' we made after the 1990s crisis has contributed to the overall positive developments during these past thirty years. The Swedish economy is working better. I would just like to briefly mention a few examples of this. Firstly, inflation has been low and stable. Measured in terms of the CPIF, it has been at 1.8 per cent since 1995, and volatility has been low. Inflation has been so low and stable that the inflation target has sometimes been questioned. However, the question leads to some circular reasoning and rather reflects the fact that the inflation target has worked well. One purpose of the target is precisely that inflation should be so low and stable that changes in it need not be taken into consideration when planning to consume or invest. However, when inflation has been so low for a long time that households and businesses do not have to think about it, it is easy to see this as a natural condition that has arisen 'by itself' rather than as a result of a consistent policy. Secondly, real wages have developed positively. From the mid-1970s and about twenty years onwards, wages remained virtually still in real terms, that is, in terms of purchasing power. Although nominal wage increases were high, they were eaten up when inflation rose correspondingly. After 1995, however, we had a clear trend increase in real wages. The inflation target and the Industrial Agreement together contributed to this development. This underlines the importance of the inflation target as a nominal anchor for the Swedish economy. Thirdly, the fiscal policy framework has contributed to the successful consolidation of Swedish public finances and these are now in a very good state. This has increased market confidence in Sweden's ability to keep its public finances in order. The difference between Swedish long-term market rates and those in other countries can be seen as a measure of this and of confidence in the Swedish economy as a whole. At the beginning of the 1990s, the long market rate in Sweden was quite a lot higher than the European and American rates. Confidence in the Swedish economy was low and most people believed that the rate of inflation would remain high. During the thirty years that have passed, the interest rate differential has shrunk and for quite some time the long-term interest rate in Sweden is at roughly the same level as in Germany. The overall picture is that the reforms implemented have benefited Sweden well. Both companies and households have benefited greatly. The economy has functioned better and prosperity has increased. Let me highlight three lessons from the crisis and subsequent reforms: First, well-functioning frameworks make crisis management easier. Sweden was well equipped to deal with the economic consequences of both the financial crisis and the pandemic. Both fiscal policy and monetary policy could contribute to counteracting the economic slowdown and help the recovery in the Swedish economy on these occasions. Sweden therefore managed the economic effects of both the financial crisis and the pandemic better than many other countries in the western world. Second, one must be careful about declaring that things will look a certain way for all time, even if that has been the case for a while. Too much consensus on the possibilities of the fixed exchange rate thirty years ago meant that it took too long to embark on a more favourable economic path. More recently, we have seen that inflation was not 'dead' as some commentators argued not very long ago, and a monetary policy with low interest rates and bond purchases was not something that lasted forever ('low for long' and 'QE infinity'). Third, reforms are painful in the short term, but often produce faster and greater results than expected. After the reforms were introduced, the Swedish economy quickly turned upwards and prosperity increased more than expected. At the same time, it is clear that not everything has developed for the better. Vulnerabilities have been built up that can make policy tightening painful; high private debt, a housing shortage, a divided labour market and lack of investment. These are structural problems that make the Swedish economy vulnerable. I will talk about this in more detail soon. But when we think about our frameworks and their future, we also need to bear in mind, as I said earlier, that the Swedish and global economies have changed since the 1990s. The first thing I want to highlight is globalisation over the last few decades. The primary manifestation of globalisation is the entrance of China into the global economy. This has meant that the working population in the world has increased significantly, as have goods and services originating outside Europe and the United States. China's entrance has also meant an increase in the global supply, which has probably dampened consumer prices and kept inflation down. During this time, global real interest rates have fallen trend-wise, partly because of globalisation and China's entry into international markets. Real interest rates are now at historically low levels. Driving forces behind this development that are often highlighted include demographic factors. A large global population of working age and increased prosperity have contributed to high global savings. These are conditions that monetary policy cannot influence, but must adapt to. As the real interest rate situation has fallen, central banks' policy rates have subsequently had to be cut to increasingly lower levels for each economic cycle in order to have sufficient effect, especially when fiscal policy has at the same time been restrictive and sometimes tight. The trend in interest rates is therefore not due to the fact that the central banks have been conducting an expansionary monetary policy for several decades, but to the fact that the real interest rate level - or the 'underlying foundation' for interest rates, if you like - has fallen. This has also led to many central banks' policy rates for a long time, and until quite recently, being at their effective lower bound, where they could not be reduced any more, at zero or just below. The low real interest rates are probably also an important explanation as to why asset prices, seen in a longer perspective, have risen and are currently high. This leads us to the changes in the Swedish economy since the 1990s crisis. Swedish housing prices and household debts have risen in parallel and almost continuously for twenty-five years, a period that is quite well in line with the downward trend in the real interest rate. The reforms in the 1990s also meant the removal of support for construction. This has led to a shortage of housing which, combined with low interest rates, has helped to push up housing prices. It should be noted that not all countries had sharply rising house prices, despite declining global interest rates. An example of this is Germany. Thus, government policies that affect the functioning of the housing market also play an important role. This also points to another trend: While public debt has fallen in recent decades, the debts of private operators have increased. Those who have large debts become unavoidably more vulnerable, and if asset prices rise for too long in a way that is decoupled from developments in the rest of the economy, this can lead to financial imbalances and ultimately to a financial crisis. The Swedish financial markets have grown and look different from at the beginning of the 1990s. Today, the banking sector is bigger in relation to GDP than it was thirty years ago, and mortgage loans have become a larger and increasingly important part of banks' operations. Furthermore, companies are financing themselves much more often in the market today, by issuing certificates and bonds. Thirty years ago, most of them borrowed from banks. Changes in financial markets can affect the transmission of monetary policy, which we need to take into account in our monetary policy assessments. In short, the development of the Swedish economy over the past 30 years may be summarised as good on the real economic side, but with some worrying signs on the financial side. I would like to broaden the perspective a little. Thirty years ago, Swedish economists and politicians alike agreed that a steadfast defence of the fixed exchange rate was the only way to break with the weak development of the Swedish economy and lead it onto a new path. Many in Sweden were stuck in a particular way of thinking, a paradigm, where we did not realise that economic reality had changed so much that our frameworks also needed to be fundamentally changed. With free capital movement, a deregulated credit market and a poorly functioning economy, the fixed exchange rate was not a good instrument for creating economic stability and prosperity. My idea, which I have already mentioned, is basically this: Each economic policy framework is designed to function well in a given economic reality. When the reality changes, the framework may also need to be adapted, reformed or supplemented. However, it is also important to be able to identify the changes and understand their implications. The frameworks should aim to be robust for events that cannot be predicted. They should also be symmetrical - be able to handle shocks that lead to both higher and lower outcomes than expected. For example, the current system was created to deal with a high government debt, high inflation and high nominal wage increases. An updated framework should have scope for dealing with risks on both the upside and the downside. The frameworks that we have built up are worth defending, but we must not be too complacent and believe that there is no potential for improvement. We know that the world is different today than it was thirty years ago and that we have built up vulnerabilities in the Swedish economy. The Riksbank, like many other central banks, faces a challenge that we have not met for decades; inflation has risen to levels that we have not seen since the early 1990s. As I have mentioned, this was initially about a number of global supply shocks that pushed up commodity prices, in particular. But, it has gradually become increasingly clear that the price increases have begun to spread widely in the economy. Thanks to the reforms in the 1990s, it is now easier than it was 30 years ago to deal with high inflation. Firstly, monetary policy now has a different mandate and a constitutional independence that enables us to act decisively to counteract high inflation. Still, the monetary policy assessments are not easy. The high level of indebtedness is likely to mean that interest rate sensitivity in the economy is greater than before, and different - public finances are less affected, but households and companies are more affected. This composition makes it likely that a given interest rate increase will have a greater effect on demand and thus on inflation. Secondly, the period of inflation targeting has led to long-term inflation expectations now being much better anchored. In the early 1990s, high inflation had been built into the expectations of economic agents in a completely different way. If prices and wages rose too much in relation to the rest of the world, it was expected that problems with cost crises and rising unemployment would be solved by writing down the value of the krona, that is, through devaluation. Thirdly, strong public finances are now a major advantage. This has increased the market's confidence in Sweden's ability to keep public finances in order and fiscal policy is not feared in the same way as in the 1970s and 1980s to be a contributing factor in itself to sustained high inflation. Fourthly, wage formation is functioning better than was previously the case, much as a result of the Industrial Agreement and the inflation target. This should also act as a built-in brake in the system and contribute to inflation not lastingly 'running out of control'. The critical question is how much the interest rate needs to be raised. Will we go from 500 per cent to -0.5 per cent to - well, what comes next? The historical average of the Riksbank's policy rate since 1907 is 4.7 per cent. In 1992, a policy rate slightly below 5 per cent would have been perceived as improbably low. Today, many people would regard it as improbably high. Within the forecast period, a 5 per cent policy rate is unlikely, but I hope that this brief historical review shows that we cannot exclude the possibility of a policy rate in line with historical averages over the next 30 years. Today the Riksbank's policy rate is 0.75 per cent. It will need to be increased further. The policy rate path indicates that the policy rate will be raised to close to 2 per cent in early 2023. Inflation outcomes have been higher than expected and the risk of inflation is still on the upside. We aim to tighten policy without the Swedish economy having to enter a recession, a so-called soft landing. However, with weaker economic activity abroad and at the same time continued high and broad inflationary pressures, it is important to be prepared for the tightening to be severely felt by many households and companies. High inflation and, at the same time, ever higher interest rates on mortgage loans, consumer credit and corporate finance will be tough for many households and companies, not least those with small margins. But, we cannot allow inflation to become entrenched at high levels. By raising the interest rate now, we will bring inflation down again. This is our mandate from the Swedish Parliament; low and stable inflation will result in better economic development for all. The frameworks we have built are worth defending, but we have built up vulnerabilities that we need to manage. Today, I would particularly like to highlight the question of investments: How can we ensure sufficient investment to build longterm resilience without further increasing household and corporate indebtedness? Does the fiscal policy framework contribute to a lack of investment in defence, infrastructure, education and climate transition? Can it be reformed so that we maintain budgetary discipline but at the same time open up for long-term investment that will improve the functioning of the economy, which also helps alleviate inflationary pressures by reducing supply side problems. The Riksbank will act to bring inflation back to the target. But, monetary policy is affected by the functioning of the fiscal policy framework and the labour market. We therefore need to facilitate a discussion on the economic policy framework and the long-term conditions for the Swedish economy over the next 30 years. I hope that our discussion today can be a starting point. for inflation in advanced economies"", 57, pp. Breman, Anna (2022), ""Inflation and monetary policy in the shadow of a war"", , Ingves, Stefan (2015), ""The housing market and household indebtedness from a central bank perspective"", speech at the SNS - Centre for Business and Policy Jansson, Per (2021), ""Is it time to review the division of roles in macroeconomic Ohlsson, Henry (2022), ""Monetary policy and inflation in times of war"", speech at Money and power - the history of , When the financial markets are large, it is important to try to assess their vulnerability and systemic risk, that is, the risk of a disturbance in the financial system that can lead to large socio-economic costs. The Riksbank has developed a measure of this, the so-called systemic risk indicator. In brief, this means that one aggregates five separate indicators for the various sub-markets that reflect developments in the banking sector, household sector, corporate sector, property market and in a group of variables referred to as external factors. Like all indicators, it does of course have its shortcomings, but it gives an indication of developments over time. From immediately after the 1990s crisis to the global financial crisis, the indicator remained at a low level, but it has remained relatively high after the financial crisis.

3998,r220831a_BOJ,japan,2022-08-31,"Economic Activity, Prices, and Monetary Policy in Japan",nakagawa,0,"I would like to begin my speech by talking about the outlook for Japan's economic activity and prices. The Bank of Japan decided the 1). In terms of economic activity, the Bank's baseline scenario is that the economy is likely to recover toward the middle of the projection period -- with the impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and supply-side constraints waning and with support from an increase in external demand, accommodative financial conditions, and the government's economic measures -- although it is expected to be under downward pressure stemming from a rise in commodity prices. Also, the Bank projects that a virtuous cycle from income to spending is likely to intensify gradually in the overall economy from the middle of the projection period. This outlook is based on the following basic mechanism: (1) overseas economies are expected to achieve steady growth as commodity prices and the global inflationary trend gradually start to show stability; (2) factors that had exerted downward pressure on Japan's economy, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and supply-side constraints, are projected to dissipate gradually; and (3) the employment and income situation will likely improve as the economy picks up. Nevertheless, this outlook entails various uncertainties. As risk factors, the Outlook Report points to the course of COVID-19 at home and abroad and its impact, developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine, as well as developments in commodity prices, overseas economic activity and prices, and global financial markets. Before looking at Japan's economy in detail, let me first discuss developments in overseas economies. With the prolongation of the effects of the situation surrounding Ukraine, inflationary pressure has been intensifying globally against the background of elevated commodity prices and supply-side constraints. In this situation, although overseas economies have been under downward pressure, due in part to monetary tightening, they seem to be maintaining their recovery trend. Looking at overseas economic conditions in terms of the Global Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) -- an indicator measuring business sentiment -- figures for both the manufacturing and services industries have declined somewhat but have been above 50, the break-even point between improvement and deterioration (Chart 2). With respect to the outlook for the global economy, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projected in its July 2022 that global growth rates for 2022 and 2023 would be 3.2 percent and 2.9 percent, respectively. While a slowdown had been anticipated as a risk, given that global growth was projected at 3.6 percent for both years in the April WEO, a significant downward revision has been made in a short period of time. With the continuing impact of COVID-19, global supply shortages of major parts such as semiconductors, as well as lockdowns implemented in major cities in China -- the country referred to as ""the workshop of the world"" -- have had a substantial adverse impact on the global economy through supply chains. In particular, China accounts for a large share of global exports of IT-related goods and automobile parts, and since Japan is heavily dependent on imports from China for these goods, the lockdowns in China have substantially affected significantly pushed down its economic activity, marking a rapid decline in the country's year- percent for the April-June quarter. As with overseas economies, although Japan's economy has been affected by a rise in commodity prices and supply-side constraints, the overall picture shows that economic activity, particularly private consumption, continues to pick up with the impact of COVID- 19 waning. I would like to explain developments in Japan's economy from two aspects: the corporate sector and the household sector. Let me start with the corporate sector. The manufacturing industry has been hit particularly hard by global supply-side constraints. As noted earlier, parts shortages that had intensified due to the lockdowns in China's major cities have affected production and exports in Japan's major industries, such as transport equipment. Data for production and exports have in fact been relatively weak (Chart 4). Exports to advanced economies continue to increase as a trend due to expansion in demand for digital-related goods, but the effects of supply-side constraints have been seen on automobile-related goods in particular. Regarding exports to emerging economies, although those to the NIEs and the ASEAN economies, for example, continue to increase, those to Russia have decreased significantly and those to China have been pushed down due to the impact of lockdowns, such as in Shanghai. Meanwhile, with the impact of the pandemic waning, the nonmanufacturing industry continues to pick up, particularly in the face-to-face services sector. Amid buoyant corporate demand for digital transformation, orders for information services remain at high levels. This contrast between the manufacturing and nonmanufacturing industries can be seen in the slowdown in business sentiment is evident in the manufacturing industry, while the nonmanufacturing industry continues to show a modest but steady recovery, although the Corporate profits have been at high levels on the whole (Chart 6). Despite being pushed down by raw material cost increases and supply-side constraints, they have been supported by the following factors: (1) profits of manufacturers have been pushed up due to steady external demand, the yen's depreciation, and other factors, and (2) profits of some large nonmanufacturing firms have been pushed up by rises in commodity prices and container freight rates. Under these circumstances, although business fixed investment has been sluggish in some segments, it continues to show signs of a pick-up, driven by digitalization- and labor saving- related investments. In terms of machinery investment as well as construction investment, the construction of logistics facilities driven by an expansion in e-commerce and projects related to urban redevelopment are contributing to pushing up private nonresidential construction. Given the state of corporate profits and business fixed investment, it seems that a virtuous cycle continues to operate in the corporate sector as a whole. Regarding the outlook, under the accommodative financial conditions, firms are expected to make investments in areas including efforts to address labor shortages, IT-related goods associated with digitalization, logistics facilities to meet the expansion in e-commerce, office buildings and commercial facilities as part of redevelopment projects, and efforts toward decarbonization. Turning to the household sector, private consumption continues to show signs of a pick-up with the impact of COVID-19 waning. However, the pace of recovery varies depending on the business type. Sales at department stores and convenience stores have almost recovered to pre-pandemic levels, and retail appears to be gradually returning to normal. In the dining- out industry, fast food consumption has returned to pre-pandemic levels, while consumption at pubs and izakaya (Japanese-style bars) remains low, despite showing signs of a turnaround. In terms of travel, which is a key industry in this region as well, recovery is still further down the road. Domestic travel, despite being relatively firm, remains well below pre-pandemic levels. Inbound travel is also far from recovery, with the volume at less than a tenth of pre- pandemic levels. Going forward, it is hoped that travel and other event-related consumption The employment and income situation has improved moderately on the whole, although some weakness has been seen in part. As for the number of employed persons, while the number of non-regular employees, mainly in face-to-face services, remains far below pre-pandemic levels, the number of regular employees has increased moderately, especially in the medical, healthcare, and welfare services industry as well as the information and communications industry, both of which face a severe labor shortage (Chart 8). Total employee income is gradually improving, as both total cash earnings per employee and the number of employees have been increasing moderately, reflecting a pick-up in overall economic activity. Special cash earnings (bonuses), which are included in total cash earnings, also seem to be increasing, reflecting recent improvement in corporate profits. In light of these developments in the corporate and household sectors, the Bank's Policy Board members' baseline scenario presented in the July Outlook Report forecasts a real GDP Japan's economy is projected to continue growing at a pace above its potential growth rate, include a somewhat large downward revision for FY2022, mainly reflecting a slowdown in overseas economies and intensification of supply-side constraints, while upward revisions Next, I would like to talk about price developments in Japan. The year-on-year rate of increase in the consumer price index (CPI) for all items less fresh food has accelerated to 2.4 percent (Chart 9). This acceleration reflects the fact that (1) the effects of the reduction in mobile phone charges, which had held down inflation, have essentially run their course, (2) energy prices have continued to register a relatively high increase, and (3) firms have been increasingly passing on higher raw material costs to selling prices, especially for food products. Other indicators that capture the underlying trend in consumer prices have exhibited the following developments. The trimmed mean of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI -- calculated by excluding items belonging to the upper and lower 10 percent of the price change distribution -- has increased to the range of 1.5-2.0 percent due to price rises in a wide range of food products. However, in terms of the mode, which is the inflation rate with the highest density in the price change distribution, the rate of increase has been relatively marginal, in the range of 0.5-1.0 percent. While these indicators show price rises driven by goods and services that reflect the higher costs of some raw materials, my view is that, on the whole, selling prices have not risen as much as raw material prices. In terms of the baseline scenario of the outlook for prices, the medians of the Policy Board members' forecasts presented in the July Outlook Report for the year-on-year rate of change for FY2024 (Chart 1). Considering the elevated crude oil prices and the time it has taken thus far for cost increases such as of raw materials to be actually passed on to selling prices, it is highly likely that price rises driven by cost-push factors will continue for the time being, mainly for energy and food products. Upward pressure on costs stemming from inefficiency in logistics due to the prolonged situation surrounding Ukraine is also likely to induce such rises. Inflation rates are projected to subsequently fall to a level below 2 percent as the contribution of the rise in energy prices gradually wanes. However, the underlying trend in inflation when excluding the effects of those prices is expected to rise mildly in positive territory amid a moderate recovery in Japan's economy and improvement in the output gap. Several factors may cause prices to deviate upward or downward from the baseline scenario presented in the July Outlook Report, one of which is developments in commodity prices. Looking at crude oil, for instance, the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) -- a leading benchmark -- peaked temporarily at 130 U.S. dollars per barrel in March 2022 and remained generally above 100 dollars for some time. It declined thereafter and has been hovering at the 90-100 dollar level more recently, reflecting a projected decline in demand due to the global economic slowdown; nevertheless, the price level remains high. The fall in demand caused by the economic slowdown carries the risk of driving down oil prices, whereas supply-side issues incur the risk of further tightening of the global crude oil market. I would now like to turn to the impact of price rises on private consumption. In order for the impact of COVID-19 and supply-side constraints, which has put downward pressure on the economy, to dissipate and for the economy to recover, the negative impact of price rises on private consumption needs to remain minimal. The main scenario is that private consumption, despite being affected by price rises, will likely increase moderately on the back of improvement in the employment and income situation, as the resumption of consumption activities progresses gradually while public health is being protected. However, this admittedly entails some degree of uncertainty. I think it will be necessary, therefore, to pay attention to the impact of price rises on household consumption going forward. Although we generalize about households, they differ in terms of income, household composition, geographical area, and other attributes. In the current environment, different households face different inflation rates. By region, for example, the proportion of spending on utility costs in Hokkaido, Tohoku, and Okinawa is known to be higher than the national average on a yearly basis. Therefore, the inflation rates that households in these regions face have been relatively higher under the current circumstances as well. Moreover, when grouped by household income, lower-income households spend a relatively higher proportion of their income on energy and food items than higher-income groups and thus are harder hit by price , which examines the impact of price rises on consumer sentiment, this confirms that the lower the income of households, the more cautious they become in their perception of ""overall livelihood."" Meanwhile, the government formulated in April the Comprehensive Emergency Measures to Counter Soaring Crude Oil and Other Prices. The measures include an expansion of gasoline subsidies and an extension of the period during which they are provided, as well as benefit payments to child-rearing households with low income. Such targeted measures are thought to be effective for households that are hard hit by price rises. In what follows, I would like to touch on the Bank's monetary policy. First, I will briefly review its response to the spread of COVID-19 since March 2020. The Bank has supported financing, mainly of firms, and maintained stability in financial markets through measures such as (1) the Special Program to Support Financing in Response to COVID-19 and (2) flexible provision of ample funds, mainly by purchasing Japanese measures, coupled with the government's measures and financial institutions' proactive efforts, have had positive effects. As a result, financial conditions in Japan have been improving on the whole, with precautionary demand for liquidity subsiding, particularly among large firms. On the other hand, financial positions of small and medium-sized firms have been on an improving trend on the whole, but it was deemed that weakness remained in some segments. Given this, at the December 2021 MPM, the Bank once more extended -- to end-September -- the duration of the fund-provisioning to small and medium-sized firms under the Special Funds-Supplying Operations to Facilitate Financing in Response to COVID-19 -- a temporary measure until the end of March 2022. The treatment of this temporary measure will be discussed at the next MPM to be held in September, based on examination of the impact of COVID-19. Next, I would like to take a look back at the Bank's monetary policy conduct from a longer (QQE) with the aim of achieving the price stability target of 2 percent at the earliest possible time. In September 2016, based on an assessment of its policy effects, the Bank enhanced monetary easing by introducing QQE with Yield Curve Control -- in which it controls short- and long-term interest rates. However, as it was expected to take time to achieve the 2 percent target, the Bank conducted an assessment in March 2021 with a view to implementing further effective and sustainable monetary easing. The assessment found that: (1) it was appropriate for the Bank to continue with monetary easing in a sustainable manner, as it was effective in pushing up economic activity and prices; and (2) it was important to make nimble and effective responses without hesitation to counter changes in economic activity, prices, and financial conditions. The current policy framework is based on these findings. The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI has been exceeding the 2 percent target level, with that for July 2022 registering 2.6 percent. This is attributable to the dissipating effects from April of the reduction in mobile phone charges and to the pass-through of cost increases in view of, for example, the rise in commodity prices and the yen's depreciation. Having said that, I do not think that it is enough simply to reach 2 percent; the end goal is for accommodative financial conditions to facilitate higher corporate profits and improved labor market conditions, and thereby generate a virtuous cycle in which wages and prices see sustained increases. I therefore consider it necessary to continue with monetary easing in order to realize this cycle and achieve the price stability target, accompanied by wage increases, in a sustainable and stable manner.

7674,r220907a_FOMC,united states,2022-09-07,Making the Financial System Safer and Fairer,barr,0,"Thank you, David, and thank you to the Brookings Institution for the invitation to speak to you today. On July 19, I had the honor of being sworn in as the Vice Chair for Supervision of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. This job was created after the Global Financial Crisis to lead the Fed's work overseeing the safety and soundness of banks and in support of its financial stability mandate. In the 12 years since then, great progress has been made in strengthening the banking system, and in strengthening oversight. I look forward to building on that work by helping to make the financial system safer and fairer, in support of an economy that serves the needs of households and businesses. On behalf of those who may wonder what ""building on that work"" means, I will speak about some of my near-term goals and how I will approach achieving them. Starting with that word ""building,"" which to me means more than just ""maintaining."" Success in financial regulation and supervision does not mean standing still because finance does not stand still. The regulatory and supervisory framework adopted after the crisis recognizes that innovation and change are constant in finance, that our understanding of existing and emerging risks can and should deepen over time, and that regulation and supervision must evolve to be effective. Many issues at the forefront of banking regulation today were not prominent five years ago, and some of them scarcely even existed. ""Building"" means staying ahead of changes, evaluating how banks are managing risks, and making the financial system safer and fairer for households and businesses. When I say that one of my top goals is to make the financial system safer, it is because keeping it safe involves an active and never-ending effort to analyze risks and make necessary  adjustments. There is no responsible alternative to this approach because the stakes are far too high to do otherwise. The Global Financial Crisis caused a terrible recession and brought the United States to the brink of an economic collapse that could have been worse than the Great Depression of the 1930s. A significant cause was excessive risk-taking by banks and inadequate regulation and supervision by the Fed and other bank regulators. A hard-won lesson from the crisis is that the savings of every retiree, the job of every worker, the payroll of every business, and the well-being of every individual depend on a safe and stable financial system. In addition to making the financial system safer, I am also committed to making it fairer. Fairness is fundamental to financial oversight, and I am committed to using the tools of regulation, supervision, and enforcement so that businesses and households have access to the services they need, the information necessary to make their financial decisions, and protection from unfair treatment. Safety and fairness may seem like distinct goals, but they are intertwined. Financial instability unfairly harms those who are economically vulnerable, so making the financial system safer is making it fairer. Nothing is more basic to the safety and soundness of banks and the stability of the financial system than capital. Capital enables firms to serve as a source of strength to the economy by continuing to lend through good times and bad. To continue to perform these functions, banks must have a sufficient level of capital to ensure that they can absorb losses and continue operations during times of stress in the financial system when losses may be significant.  An important principle of the capital framework is that it must evolve through a continuous process of incorporating new risks that may emerge. While history is a guide to identifying the range of stresses that a bank may face, capital policy must also be forward- looking and responsive to changes in macroeconomic conditions, market structure, and financial activities. A second principle is that the capital framework should be risk focused. Different activities pose different potential for loss, and the capital regime should calibrate requirements to account for the risks of specific activities. At the same time, simpler, non-risk-based approaches can serve as important backstops, given the complexity of risk-based approaches and evidence that these approaches can be gamed. As such, leverage ratios also serve an important role in this framework. A third principle is that requirements should be tiered. As firms increase in systemic importance, the social cost of their failure grows. Regulations should be designed to require firms to internalize the costs that their potential failure would impose on the broader financial system and thus on businesses and households. This means that firms face higher costs through more stringent regulations as they grow in complexity, size, and interconnectedness. And rightly, that community banks face simpler regulations. We are looking holistically at our capital tools to understand how they are supporting the resilience of the financial system, individually and in combination. When calibrating requirements, we will work to minimize unintended consequences, limit opportunities for gaming, and avoid excess compliance costs that do not result in risk reduction. Taking a holistic view will help us consider adjustments, if any, to the supplementary leverage ratio,  countercyclical capital buffer, and stress testing. Within this context, I am also committed to implementing enhanced regulatory capital requirements that align with the final set of ""Basel III"" standards or the so-called the ""Basel endgame."" This process will involve working with other federal banking agencies and soliciting public input, and I'll have more to say about this later this fall. Sufficient capital in the financial system helps support the resiliency of individual banks, but it is still important to ensure that, if a large firm gets into trouble, it can be resolved without a costly bailout. The Dodd-Frank Act established the framework necessary to end bank bailouts. firm whose failure would pose substantial risks to our financial system, in a way that will protect the economy while ensuring that large financial firms--not taxpayers--bear any costs. In addition, the Fed and FDIC require large banks to develop living wills to demonstrate that they can be resolved in an orderly way. Many gains have been made from this process. While recognizing these gains, we need to continue to analyze whether firms are taking all appropriate steps to limit the costs to society of their potential failure. As such, we will continue to work with the FDIC to rigorously review firms' plans, making clear when firms do not meet our expectations and when remediation is necessary. In addition, beyond globally systemically important banks, or G-SIBs, we will be looking at the resolvability of some of the other largest banks as they grow and as their significance in the financial system increases. As we consider future policy actions in this area, the Fed will work with our colleagues at other banking regulatory agencies and seek public comment.  Mergers are a feature of vibrant industries, but the advantages that firms seek to gain through mergers must be weighed against the risks that mergers can pose to competition, consumers, and financial stability. Another priority of mine is to evaluate our approach to reviewing banks' proposed acquisitions. The Board is required to consider a range of factors when reviewing proposed mergers. A merged institution may be able to provide more competitive products and services, but it could also have the potential to reduce competition and access to financial services in a geographic area by raising prices, narrowing the range of services offered, and reducing the supply of small business or community development loans that rely on local knowledge. Assessing these risks is a crucial component of reviewing proposed mergers. In addition, we review the potential effects on the convenience and needs of the communities to be served by the merged entity, particularly low-income communities. the Dodd-Frank Act, we are also required to consider financial stability risks. These risks may be difficult to assess, but this consideration is critical. I am working with Federal Reserve staff to assess how we are performing merger analysis and where we can do better.  Another priority for me as Vice Chair is the regulation and oversight of new forms of private money created through stablecoins. Stablecoins, like other unregulated private money, could pose financial stability risks. History shows that in the absence of appropriate regulation, private money is subject to destabilizing runs, financial instability, and the potential for widespread economic harm. In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, before the advent of prudential bank regulation and deposit insurance and before action was taken to ensure private money creation by banks was appropriately regulated, repeated crises did substantial damage to the U.S. economy. I believe Congress should work expeditiously to pass much-needed legislation to bring stablecoins, particularly those designed to serve as a means of payment, inside the prudential regulatory perimeter. I look forward to continued partnership with other regulatory agencies and Congress to address the risks of stablecoins. Before I move away from the discussion of making banks safer, let me say a few words about the potential risks to banks posed by climate change. As our nation, and the world, grapple with how to respond to climate change, banks are increasingly focused on the risks that climate change brings to their balance sheets. The Federal Reserve is working to understand how climate change may pose risks to individual banks and to the financial system. The Federal Reserve's mandate in this area is important, but narrow, focused on our supervisory responsibilities and our role in promoting a safe and stable financial system. In the near-term, we intend to work with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the FDIC to provide guidance to large banks on how we expect them to identify, measure, monitor, and  manage the financial risks of climate change. In addition, we are considering how to develop and implement climate risk scenario analyses. In that regard, next year we plan to launch a pilot micro-prudential scenario analysis exercise to better assess the long-term, climate-related financial risks facing the largest institutions. These are a few of my near-term priorities to help make the financial system safer. I'll have more to say about these, and other priorities for safety and soundness, in the coming weeks and months. Let me turn now more directly to my other major objective as Vice Chair, which is to make the financial system fairer. In the past, I have described the three essential elements of fairness in the financial system as a three-legged stool because all three are necessary for any aspect of fairness to work. The three are (1) financial capability, (2) financial access, and (3) consumer protection. In terms of financial capability, an important component is transparency in the cost of services, which means making sure consumers have the information they need to make good decisions. Along with other bank regulatory agencies, the Federal Reserve has a role to play in ensuring banks disclose the costs and explain the conditions on the services they provide. More broadly, though, it means basing policy on a deeper understanding of human decision-making, and the contexts in which households and businesses make those choices. Under financial inclusion, one example would be promoting access to low-cost and safe banking services for low- and moderate-income (LMI) consumers, such as through local Bank On initiatives. And consumer protection involves using supervision and regulation to fully  implement laws to promote fair lending, consumer protection, and transparency in the consumer financial services marketplace. Let me say a bit about where innovation fits into this goal of making the financial system fairer. We should welcome financial innovation as a positive force that can increase access and lower costs for individuals and businesses. That said, innovation can also introduce new risks for consumers. We have already seen occasions when uses of new technologies and data can raise serious concerns about violations of fair lending laws. As innovative financial products develop and grow rapidly, excitement can outrun the proper assessment of risk. As we have seen with the growth of crypto assets, in a rapidly rising and volatile market, participants may come to believe that they understand new products only to learn that they don't, and then suffer significant losses. Crypto-asset related activity, both outside and inside supervised banks, requires oversight so that people are fully aware of the risks they face. We plan to work with other bank regulatory agencies to ensure that crypto activity inside banks is well regulated, based on the principle of same risk, same activity, same regulation, regardless of the technology used for the activity. I plan to make sure that the crypto activity of banks that we supervise is subject to the necessary safeguards that protect the safety of the banking system as well as bank customers. Banks engaged in crypto-related activities need to have appropriate measures in place to manage novel risks associated with those activities and to ensure compliance with all relevant laws, including those related to money laundering.  At a more basic level, we need to focus on access to fast, efficient digital payments. This is a matter both of efficiency and of fairness. Low-income households can ill afford to wait days for their income checks to clear, nor can small businesses. A three-day payment delay is an annoyance to someone with savings and ample credit, but it is a costly burden, and sometimes a serious problem for others. And overdraft and insufficient funds fees hit LMI households hard. I have been working on issues of financial inclusion for a significant portion of my career as a public official and as an academic. I am so pleased with the progress made toward instant payments under the leadership of Vice Chair Brainard and Chair Powell, and I am looking forward to doing whatever I can to support this work, including the launch of the FedNow Service. The Federal Reserve has a responsibility to facilitate payments that work well for everyone, and we are committed to doing so. Rounding out my discussion of access to financial services, I will end my remarks today passed in 1977, encourages insured depository institutions to meet the credit needs of the communities in which they are chartered, including LMI neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of such institutions. The CRA was designed to address past abuses of financial institutions, such as redlining. The CRA sends the unequivocal message that there is no place for discrimination in the financial system, and that every community and every borrower deserve to be treated fairly. Earlier this year the OCC, the Fed, and the FDIC jointly invited comment on a proposal designed to strengthen and modernize CRA regulations to achieve the  objectives of the law. I strongly support the goals of the proposal and look forward to contributing to the important work underway, again led by Vice Chair Brainard. So, to wrap up, I have tried to lay out my approach and a bit of my near-term agenda, as Vice Chair for Supervision, for making the financial system safer and fairer for households and businesses. As I said at the outset, I believe these goals are related and mutually reinforcing, so that progress in one area will advance efforts in the other. I have discussed a number of specific issues to illustrate these principles, but I'll have more to say about these ideas, and other important reforms, in the coming weeks and months.

7675,r220907b_FOMC,united states,2022-09-07,Bringing Inflation Down,brainard,0,"Over the past year, inflation has been very high in the United States and around the world (figure 1). High inflation imposes costs on all households, and especially low- income households. The multiple waves of the pandemic, combined with Russia's war against Ukraine, unleashed a series of supply shocks hitting goods, labor, and commodities that, in combination with strong demand, have contributed to ongoing high inflation. With a series of inflationary supply shocks, it is especially important to guard against the risk that households and businesses could start to expect inflation to remain above 2 percent in the longer run, which would make it much more challenging to bring inflation back down to our target. The Federal Reserve is taking action to keep inflation expectations anchored and bring inflation back to 2 percent over time. While last year's rapid pace of economic growth was boosted by accommodative fiscal and monetary policy as well as reopening, demand has moderated this year as those tailwinds have abated. A sizable fiscal drag on output growth alongside a sharp tightening in financial conditions has contributed to a slowing in activity. In the first half of 2022, real gross domestic product (GDP) declined outright, overall real consumer spending grew at just one-fourth of its 2021 pace, and residential investment, a particularly interest-sensitive sector, declined by 8 percent (figure 2).  The concentration of strong consumer spending in supply-constrained sectors has contributed to high inflation. Consumer spending is in the midst of an ongoing but still incomplete rotation back toward pre-pandemic patterns. Real spending on goods has declined modestly in each of the past two quarters, while real spending on services has expanded at about half its 2021 growth rate. Even so, the level of goods spending remains 5 percent above the level implied by its pre-pandemic trend, while services spending remains 4 percent below its trend (figure 3). In addition to the fiscal drag and tighter financial conditions, high inflation-- particularly in food and gas prices--has restrained consumer spending by reducing real purchasing power. While price increases in food and energy are weighing on discretionary spending by all Americans, they are especially hard on low-income families, who spend three-fourths of their income on necessities such as food, gas, and shelter--more than double the 31 percent for high-income households. Since the very elevated prices at the pump in June, the nationwide average price of a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline has declined every day throughout July and August, most recently falling below $4 a gallon, according to the American Automobile The rise and fall of gasoline prices played a major role in the dynamics of inflation over the summer, contributing 0.4 percentage point to month-over-month percentage point in July. This 0.6 percentage point swing in the contribution of gasoline  prices was an important driver of the decline in month-over-month PCE inflation from 1 percent in June to negative 0.1 percent in July. In contrast, food price pressures continue to worsen, reflecting Russia's continuing war against Ukraine, as well as extreme weather events in the United States, The PCE index for food and beverages has increased each month this year by an average of 1.2 percent, resulting in an 8 1/2 percent cumulative increase in the index year-to-date through July. For context, the net change in the food and beverages price index over the entire four-year period before the pandemic was only 0.5 percent. Core inflation--inflation excluding volatile food and energy prices--also moderated in July. Core goods PCE inflation decelerated to 0.1 percent month-over- month in July after averaging 0.5 percent in May and June. While the moderation in monthly inflation is welcome, it will be necessary to see several months of low monthly inflation readings to be confident that inflation is moving back down to 2 percent. How long it takes to move inflation back down to 2 percent will depend on a combination of continued easing in supply constraints, slower demand growth, and lower markups, against the backdrop of anchored expectations. With regard to supply constraints, a variety of indicators are showing signs of improvement on delivery times and supplies of some goods. In addition, labor force participation showed a welcome increase in the August employment data, particularly in the boost in participation among  women in the core working years of 25 to 54 years of age. Even with this improvement, the participation rate is still 1 percentage point below its pre-pandemic level, well in excess of the decline in the participation rate that would have been expected due to retirements in the absence of the pandemic. Reductions in markups could also make an important contribution to reduced pricing pressures. Last year's rapid demand growth in the face of supply constraints led to product shortages in some areas of the economy and high margins for many firms. Although we are hearing some reports of large retailers planning markdowns due to excess inventories, we do not have hard data at an aggregate level suggesting that businesses are reducing margins in response to more price sensitivity among customers. At an aggregate level, in the second quarter, measures of profits in the nonfinancial sector relative to GDP remained near the postwar peak reached last year. Using the available macroeconomic data, it is challenging to measure directly how much firms mark up their prices relative to their costs. That said, there is evidence at the sectoral level that margins remain high in areas such as motor vehicles and retail. After moving together closely for several years, starting early last year, the new motor vehicle consumer price index (CPI), which measures the price dealers charge to customers, diverged from the equivalent producer price index (PPI), which measures the price dealers paid to manufacturers. Since then, the CPI has increased three times faster than the PPI (figure 4). This divergence between retail and wholesale prices suggests an unusually large retail auto margin. With production now increasing, and interest-  sensitive demand cooling, there may soon be pressures to reduce vehicle margins and prices in order to move the higher volume of cars being produced off dealer lots. Similarly, overall retail margins--the difference between the price retailers charge for a good and the price retailers paid for that good--have risen significantly more than the average hourly wage that retailers pay workers to stock shelves and serve customers over the past year, suggesting that there may also be scope for reductions in retail margins. With gross retail margins amounting to about 30 percent of sales, a reduction in currently elevated margins could make an important contribution to reduced inflation pressures in consumer goods. Labor demand continues to exhibit considerable strength, which is hard to reconcile with the more downbeat tone of activity. Year-to-date through August, payroll employment has increased by about 3 1/2 million jobs, a surprisingly strong increase given the decelerating spending and declining GDP over the first half of the year. The unemployment rate has fallen, on net, from 4 percent in January to 3.7 percent in August. Possibly the strongest indications that the labor market is tight were the first- and second- quarter readings of the employment cost index (ECI), which point to strong and broad- based growth in total hourly compensation. The 6.3 percent reading for the ECI in the second quarter was the largest annualized quarterly growth in compensation under this metric since 1982. The most recent reading of average hourly earnings suggested some possible cooling, decelerating from a gain of 0.5 percent in July to 0.3 percent in August, although it will be important to see additional data. The deceleration in economic activity thus far this year has coincided with only a slight easing in job openings, on net, since their peak in March. The current high level of  job openings relative to job seekers remains close to the largest in postwar history, consistent with a tight labor market (figure 5). Businesses that experienced unprecedented challenges restoring or expanding their workforces following the pandemic may be more inclined to make greater efforts to retain their employees than they normally would when facing a slowdown in economic activity. This may mean that slowing aggregate demand will lead to a smaller increase in unemployment than we have seen in previous recessions, but it is too early to draw any definitive conclusions, and I will be monitoring a variety of labor market indicators closely. As we follow through on our plan to move monetary policy to an appropriately restrictive stance, the effect of the increased policy rate and pace of balance sheet shrinkage should put downward pressure on aggregate demand, particularly in interest- sensitive sectors like housing. Continued improvements in supply conditions and a further rotation of consumption away from goods and into services should also help by reducing price pressures in goods. With regard to non-housing services, the magnitude of price pressure over the next several quarters will depend on an overall slowing in spending as well as the extent to which labor supply improves in these sectors. Since pivoting last year, our actions and communications have tightened financial conditions significantly and at a much more rapid speed than earlier cycles. So far during 2022, real 2-year yields have risen more than 350 basis points to about 1.2 percent, and 10-year real yields have risen almost 200 basis points and now stand at 0.85 percent--in  the range of values for 10-year real yields from 2014 to 2018. The rapid tightening in monetary policy is also reflected in a significant increase in the projected real short rate: The Blue Chip Financial Forecasts has the expected short rate moving above 0.5 percent in real terms to a significantly higher level than pre-pandemic within the next 12 months It may take some time for the full effect of these tighter financial conditions to work their way through the economy. The disinflationary process here at home should be reinforced by weaker demand and tightening in many other countries. This is particularly the case as Europe contends with downside risks to activity and a severe energy shortage caused by Russia's war against Ukraine, and as China maintains its zero-COVID approach against a backdrop of weaker consumption. At some point in the tightening cycle, the risks will become more two-sided. The rapidity of the tightening cycle and its global nature, as well as the uncertainty around the pace at which the effects of tighter financial conditions are working their way through aggregate demand, create risks associated with overtightening. And if history is any guide, it is important to avoid the risk of pulling back too soon. Following a lengthy sequence of adverse supply shocks to goods, labor, and commodities that, in combination with strong demand, drove inflation to multidecade highs, we must maintain a risk- management posture to defend the inflation expectations anchor. While we have no control over the supply shocks to food, energy, labor, or semiconductors, we have both the capacity and the responsibility to maintain anchored inflation expectations and price stability.  We are in this for as long as it takes to get inflation down. So far, we have expeditiously raised the policy rate to the peak of the previous cycle, and the policy rate will need to rise further. As of this month, the maximum monthly reduction in the balance sheet will be nearly double the level of the previous cycle. Together, the increase in the policy rate and the reduction in the balance sheet should help bring demand into alignment with supply. Monetary policy will need to be restrictive for some time to provide confidence that inflation is moving down to target. The economic environment is highly uncertain, and the path of policy will be data dependent. While the precise course of action will depend on the evolution of the outlook, I am confident we will achieve a return to 2 percent inflation. Our resolve is firm, our goals are clear, and our tools are up to the task.","['inflation', 'inflationary', 'recessions', 'macroeconomic', 'fiscal']","['inflation high', 'high inflation', 'reduced inflation', 'bring inflation', 'inflation remain']","['ongoing high inflation', 'inflation far expeditiously', 'figure high inflation', 'high inflation imposes', 'conditions high inflation']","['ongoing high inflation', 'high inflation', 'inflationary supply shocks', 'inflation', 'monthly inflation']"

Colette also discusses why the FPC decided to withdraw its mortgage affordability test. Thank you for this invitation to open the workshop today. The topics you are planning to discuss are of the utmost importance, and I am delighted to be able to contribute to the discussion. I have long been interested in the contribution that mutuals, in their various forms, can make to the array of market possibilities open to borrowers and savers - and indeed served on the board of one of our largest mutuals some years ago. And, Andre, it is a pleasure to be here again at the Business School and to reconnect with colleagues. As you will all know, the Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee (FPC), of which I am an external member, is responsible for monitoring and acting to remove or reduce systemic risks in order to ensure the resilience of the UK's financial system. This obviously covers a very wide range of issues, and I have chosen today to focus on some that I think will be of interest to this audience. It is of course equally obvious to all of us here today that the many challenges posed by rising inflation require intense vigilance. I am planning to cover two topics this morning: first, to review our current thinking about the importance of household indebtedness to financial stability - and in this section to update you on the progress of some important work ongoing at the Bank about how we are deepening our understanding of how household debt burdens have changed over time and what debt might mean for household behaviour, especially in the current economic environment. The second topic I will touch on is the recent review that the Bank has done of its so-called housing tools - really, they ought to be called mortgage market tools - and the outcome of the consultation we have done, and whose results we have implemented, on one of these tools, the affordability test. Most, if not all of us, in this room will recall the interplay between mortgage debt and financial stability that was characteristic of the global financial crisis (GFC) that began in 2007. The crash in the US subprime mortgage market, combined with opaque securitisation and inadequate bank capitalisation led to significant spillovers to the global financial system. In the UK, loose underwriting standards and high mortgage leverage acted as some of the weaknesses in financial stability and amplifiers of the crisis. All of this has been somewhat exhaustively documented but it is worth reminding ourselves of a couple of points today. First, unsustainably high mortgage debt has historically affected UK financial stability via two channels. The first is through the effect on borrower resilience, where highly indebted households face challenges from real income cuts and/or mortgage rate increases and cut spending sharply - which can amplify a downturn, with potentially systemic consequences for financial stability. Second, shocks can be transmitted to financial stability through the lender resilience channel, where lenders experience losses when highly indebted households face re-payment difficulties. These losses can result in a reduction of the supply of credit to households, businesses and the wider economy. As we have said in our most recent Financial Stability Report (FSR), which was published on 5 July , our view is that the current shock does not at this stage pose the same risks to lenders and the financial system as previous shocks. Lenders are well capitalised and have limited direct exposures to Russia and Ukraine, as well as being resilient to risks stemming from sectors which are particularly exposed to higher commodity prices. The FPC continues to monitor the resilience of banks to further downside risks. And to support our understanding of those risks, the 2022 annual cyclical scenario (ACS) stress test will be launched later this month. It will assess the resilience of the UK banking system to deep simultaneous recessions in the UK and global economies, real income shocks as well as large falls in assets prices and higher global interest rates. But even in a less severe scenario, we are conscious that the rise in living costs and interest rates will put increased pressure on the finances of UK households in the coming months, with lower-income households in particular finding it difficult to adjust their spending behaviour in response to the rise in prices. This will test the degree of borrower resilience in the system as borrowers struggle with bills or [to] manage their other spending commitments. We are facing a highly uncertain economic outlook, as my colleagues on the MPC have been reporting. So, at the risk of restating the blindingly obvious, I have to say that everything I am saying now has to be seen against that backdrop. I would like first to give you a quick overview of some useful granular research being done by colleagues at the Bank on debt service ratios - DSRs for short - recently published in the latest Financial Stability Report. In the time available, this can only be a curtain raiser - but if any of you would like to follow up with my Bank colleagues, I would be delighted to connect you. Before I delve into the research on the DSRs, let me take a step back and provide some scene setting on the household debt. The total stock of UK household debt (excluding student loans) was just under PS2 trillion in 2022 Q1, equivalent to around 124.5% of total household income. Although high compared to historical standards, this is materially below its 2008 peak of 146%. This has been driven by deleveraging and by slower growth in new household lending post global financial crisis. In particular, average annual household debt growth slowed from around 9% pre-GFC to around 2.4% over the last decade. At the same time, annual income growth slowed by less, from an average of 4.6% pre-GFC to 3%. And higher debt levels have generally been more affordable than prior to the GFC given a prolonged period of low interest rates, as well as policies to build resilience in the financial system, which I will come back to later in my remarks. So households entered the pandemic period reasonably resilient and have been able to maintain a lot of this resilience. While lockdowns brought a sharp contraction in activity, they also led to a large rise in household savings. This coupled with extensive fiscal, monetary and lender support (through payment holidays) helped many households to bridge through. To monitor household debt affordability for the most highly indebted households, in previous FSRs, we focused on gross DSRs - that is, the ratio of mortgage repayments to pre-tax income. Using the Wealth and Assets Survey, Bank staff research has showed that households with a mortgage DSRs at or above 40% were more likely to experience repayment difficulties during the financial crisis. In 2022 H1, following the pandemic, the share of such households increased to around 1 3/4 %, and were broadly in line with pre-GFC averages. Within the context of more recent economic challenges, let me now turn to measures we developed to better assess the impact of increased cost of living. As we are all only too aware, we are living through a considerable increase in the cost of living as a consequence of Russia's invasion of Ukraine driving the price of food and energy higher, with restrictions of gas supplies to Europe starting to fully feed into household bills. And the distributional effects of such a shock are serious: households in the lower parts of the income distribution are disproportionately affected by the increases in the costs of essential items. The gross DSR measures we generally report are not well suited to account for the increases in the cost of living. As such in the July FSR, we introduced some innovative work which adjusts the gross DSRs to better capture debt affordability pressures that households are likely to face. The cost of living adjusted DSRs are constructed based on a measure of disposable household income which deducts taxes and an estimate of essential spending (including spending on utility and energy bills, food and transport, to name a few). The measure of debt-servicing consists of regular debt repayments. The new, more granular measure better captures the effects of the following factors on debt sustainability: Taking all those together we showed in the July FSR that the share of households with high cost of living adjusted DSRs are likely to remain at around the current levels of 1.7% over the course of 2022, and below the pre-2008 levels (at 2.8%). While the share of households struggling is expected to remain below Financial Crisis peaks this year, we may still see some increase in defaults or households needing to make sharp, and difficult, cuts to their spending. Since the publication of the FSR, the MPC published its updated projections in the August MPR. As the August MPR sets out, the rise in energy prices has exacerbated falls in real incomes, and so led to another significant deterioration in the outlook in the UK, with GDP growth slowing and the economy contracting later this year. In turn, this means that the outlook is even more challenging for UK households than it was at the time of the FSR. Moreover, there are a number of uncertainties attached to the outlook. In particular, a lot depends on how persistent the energy price shock will be, what happens to incomes over the same periods and how wage growth is distributed. This new approach to estimating DSRs gives us the ability to take a more granular approach to estimating the possible evolution of household debt - and hence to testing whether the financial system itself is likely to remain resilient to these macro shocks. The FPC will continue to monitor UK household debt vulnerabilities, as well as other vulnerabilities affecting financial stability, such as those arising from pressures in the corporate sector, and major UK bank resilience to those vulnerabilities. This is a centrepiece of the job of the FPC. I now want to turn to the topic of the FPC's measures, and the role that they have played - and continue to play - in supporting the resilience of households and the financial system. In the wake of the financial crisis of 2008, regulators took various steps to guard against a further risk-related increase in household indebtedness. Following their Mortgage Market Review, in 2014 the FCA introduced tougher requirements for lenders to ensure that prospective borrowers could afford their mortgages. This included requiring verification of income and taking account of other debt and spending commitments. And, importantly, where the interest rate is variable or is fixed for less than 5 years, a requirement to test whether borrowers could still afford the loan if, at any point in the first five years, interest rates were to rise. At the same time, the FPC supplemented the FCA rules with a recommendation specifying that lenders should assess whether borrowers could still afford their mortgages if rates were to rise by 3 percentage points (the affordability test). This was accompanied by a requirement for lenders to limit loans of more than 4.5 times income to at most 15% of their new lending (the flow limit). It is these requirements have led to the resilient position for household indebtedness as we enter this period of heightened uncertainty. In 2014, when the test was introduced, most major lenders were using self-imposed interest rate stress tests of around 7%, compared with SVRs in the region of 4-4.5% at the time. Which implied a ""stress"" of 2.5-3%, broadly in line with the FPC's recommendation. What the FPC was aiming to do was to reinforce prevailing underwriting standards and discourage an increase in borrowers with extreme levels of indebtedness. Following a consultation earlier this year, however, the FPC has recently withdrawn its affordability test, although the underlying FCA framework remains in place. There are a number of reasons for the decision: However, a minority of respondents to the consultation opposed withdrawing the affordability test given concerns about the deterioration in macroeconomic outlook and the risk that borrowers could take on mortgages that are not affordable. The FPC is alert to these concerns, but judges that prudent underwriting standards over recent years have improved the resilience of households with mortgage debts, while the LTI flow limit and the FCA's rules will continue to maintain these standards and ensure that households do not take on unaffordable levels of mortgage debt. In light of higher interest rates and a weaker outlook, my colleagues and I on the FPC will continue to closely monitor the pressures on household finances, including through using our enhanced measure of DSRs. I have spoken this morning about only one part of the FPC's work - covering household debt and the mortgage market. Of course, we have a range of issues we constantly monitor and, if I may close with a commercial break, I hope that you will all continue to read our Financial Stability Reports summarising all the issues we aim to cover. The next FSR is due on 13 December but the FPC will also provide an update on our latest assessment of risks following the Q3 meeting in October. Thank you. Essential spending includes utility and council tax bills, housing maintenance, food and non-alcoholic beverages, motor fuels, vehicle maintenance, public transport and communication. Based on these adjustments the equivalent threshold at which households are likely to struggle with repayments is 70% of disposable income.

280,r220908a_BOA,australia,2022-09-08,        Inflation and the Monetary Policy Framework,lowe,1,"I would like to begin by thanking everybody who is attending today in support of the Anika Foundation. It's been a hard time for young people over the past couple of years, so the Foundation's work supporting young Australians is more important than ever. Thank you for your support. Last year, this event was held online as we were in the midst of the Delta outbreak. At the time, the economy was contracting, inflation was below the target band and the normalisation of monetary policy still seemed to be in the distance. A year on, a lot has changed. We are no longer in lockdowns, the economy has performed well, unemployment is at a 50-year low, inflation is the highest it has been in years and interest rates are being increased quickly. Today, I would like to focus my remarks on the pick-up in inflation. After a number of years in which inflation was below target, it is now considerably above target and is expected to go higher still in the short term. The extent of this turnaround in inflation has come as a surprise to many, including us. So, I would like to begin by exploring some of the lessons from this surprising burst in inflation. I will then discuss why, in my view, flexible inflation targeting remains the appropriate monetary policy framework for Australia. I will conclude with some remarks on the importance of returning inflation to target over time and how the RBA's recent monetary policy decisions will help achieve this. First, to the very large surprise in inflation. When I spoke at the Anika Foundation event last year, CPI inflation in Australia had been below 2 per cent for a number of years and, in underlying terms, was just 1.6 per cent highest rates in many years. This lift in inflation has come as a surprise. A year ago, the RBA was forecasting that inflation over 2022 would be just 1 3/4 per cent. Now, we are expecting CPI inflation this year to be around 7 3/4 per cent. This is a very big change and a very large forecast miss. The RBA has plenty of company in not predicting this lift in inflation. This next graph shows our forecasts of underlying inflation a year ago, as well as the range of forecasts from private-sector economists (Graph 2). Some forecasters were certainly expecting higher inflation than we were, but the magnitude of the pick-up in inflation has taken everybody by surprise. The same is true internationally. This next graph shows Consensus forecasts for headline inflation in August last year for the United States, the euro area, the United Kingdom and Canada (Graph 3). In all four cases, inflation was expected to be close to 2 per cent by now. Instead, the latest readings of CPI inflation in these four areas are Forecast misses of this scale should lead to soul-searching by forecasters and they certainly have at the RBA. It is important that we learn from this and improve our understanding of the inflation process. One starting point for understanding the unexpected surge in inflation is the big lift in energy prices stemming from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and various problems in the production of energy around the world. Analysis by the European Central Bank suggests that around three-quarters of the surprise in inflation in the euro area reflects unexpected developments in the markets for oil, gas and electricity. England estimates that higher energy prices will directly boost CPI inflation by 6 1/2 percentage points this year. And in Australia, the price of petrol at the bowser increased by 32 per cent over the past year (Graph 4). The direct effect of this alone has been to add 1.2 percentage points to Australia's CPI inflation, and on top of this there are second-round effects of higher fuel prices. While this lift in energy prices explains some of the surge in inflation, it is by no means the full story. We can make some further progress in understanding this surge by using the standard workhorse models of inflation, which explain inflation by inflation expectations and the aggregate output gap. Strong demand at a time of impaired supply - and thus a closure of the output gap - certainly helps explain part of the recent higher inflation. But these models fall well short of explaining the magnitude of the lift in inflation and, in my view, face some real challenges. One of these challenges is that the focus on the aggregate output gap is insufficient in a world in which shocks are highly uneven across sectors. We need to pay more attention to developments in individual sectors. One of the distinguishing features of the past two years is that the shocks have been highly asymmetrical. In 2020 and 2021 there was a huge increase in demand for goods and a decline in demand for services. This was particularly evident in the United States, where the demand for goods surged by close to 20 per cent in less than a year and the demand for many services was weak (Graph 5). A similar, although less pronounced, pattern was evident in Australia. This surge in demand for goods occurred at the same time as the supply side was constrained. This was partly because COVID interrupted production. But it goes beyond this. Even in good times, the supply side would have had trouble coping with a 20 per cent surge in demand in a short period of time. Just-in-time inventory management and long supply chains had made the system less resilient and less able to respond to rapid and unexpected shifts in demand. The result was that many industries quickly found themselves on the sharply upward sloping part of the supply curve, and prices increased. And there was no offsetting deflation in those parts of the economy where demand was weak. One lesson here is that what is happening at the sectoral level is important in influencing the overall inflation dynamics in our economy - it's not just the aggregates that matter. Resources don't move freely between sectors, which means that the composition of demand and supply is important, not just the overall level of demand. One relevant example in Australia has been in the home-building sector. Over the past year, the cost of building a new home has increased by 20 per cent (Graph 6). This alone has added close to 2 percentage points to headline inflation. Very strong demand in this sector - partly due to low interest rates and government grants totalling up to $35,000 for some first home buyers - came up against COVID-related problems on the supply side. The result was a big jump in prices, which has had a material impact on the overall inflation rate in Australia. The other element in the workhorse models of inflation is inflation expectations. Inflation expectations have picked up a little, but the measures derived from financial prices suggest there is a high degree of confidence that inflation will return to target (Graph 7). This suggests that a pick-up in inflation expectations is not a primary driver of the sharp rise in inflation. There is something here, though, that is worth watching that is not easily captured in our standard models - and that is the general inflation psychology in the community. By this, I mean the general willingness of businesses to seek price increases and the willingness of the community to accept price increases. Prior to the pandemic, it was very difficult for a business person to stand in the public square and say they were putting their prices up. And a common theme from our liaison was that, because most businesses had trouble putting their prices up, wage increases had to be kept modest. That was the mindset. Today, business people are able to stand in the public square and say they are putting their prices up, and they can point to a number of reasons why. The community doesn't like it, but there is a begrudging acceptance. And with prices rising, it is harder to resist bigger wage increases, especially in a tight labour market. So the psychology shifts. Or as the Bank for International Settlements put it in its recent annual report: when inflation is high, it becomes a coordinating mechanism for pricing decisions. In other words, people really start to pay attention to changes in costs and prices. The result can be faster and fuller pass-through of cost shocks and more frequent price and wage adjustments. There is some evidence that is already occurring, which is contributing to the strength of the pick-up in inflation. So, it is something to watch. I would now like to turn to the monetary policy framework, as this framework guides the Reserve Bank Board's decisions about interest rates each month. At a very high level, the RBA's job is to support the maximisation of the economic welfare of Australians, with the tools and responsibilities of a central bank. Delivering medium-term price stability is fundamental here. Since the early 1990s, our operating definition of 'price stability' has been that inflation averages 2 point something per cent. At this level, inflation is something that most people don't normally need to worry about. In terms of the policy framework, we adopted a flexible inflation targeting framework around three decades ago and this has been supported by successive governments. Under that framework, our operating objective has been to have consumer price inflation average between 2 and 3 per cent over time. I would like to highlight two aspects of this formulation. The first is the focus on 2 to 3 per cent . This focus has provided an important nominal anchor for inflation expectations in the Australian community. While the inflation rate has varied from year to year, it has always returned to the 2 to 3 per cent range. It has also averaged 2 point something per cent since the early 1990s. The second is the on average, over time aspect of the target. This formulation has provided the Board with the flexibility to pursue price stability in a way that, in its judgement, best contributes to full employment and the general welfare of the Australian people, which are both legislated objectives of the RBA. The RBA was an early adopter of flexible inflation targeting, eschewing the hard-edged stricter versions of inflation targeting that were popular in the 1990s. That was the right call. I note that the recent reviews by the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Canada have all concluded that some form of flexible inflation targeting is the preferred monetary policy regime in their countries. In my view, flexible inflation targeting has served Australia well and remains the best monetary policy regime for Australia. It is certainly worth examining alternatives as part of the current Review of the RBA, but I do not see a strong case for a move away from this broad approach. Flexible inflation targeting is not a perfect monetary policy regime, but it is hard to do better. Any monetary policy regime is likely to face challenges in today's changing world. Our economies are adjusting to the ageing of the population, the emergence of new digital technologies, climate change, slower productivity growth and a less interconnected global economy. These changes are affecting the dynamics of inflation and will continue to do so. As our economy continues to adapt, the strong nominal anchor and the flexibility provided by flexible inflation targeting will both be very helpful. These attributes are difficult (although not impossible) to replicate with another monetary policy regime. There are, though, some elements of the design of our flexible inflation target that could helpfully be looked at as part of the current Review. The first is whether 2 to 3 per cent is the appropriate nominal anchor and operating definition of 'price stability'. Many other countries have chosen 2 per cent as their nominal anchor. As part of the Review, it is worth examining the arguments for and against a change to the nominal anchor. The second element is how to best think about the 'flexible' part of flexible inflation targeting. Flexibility means that the Board's decisions are not determined by a rule - we have the flexibility to achieve the broad objective of price stability in a way that maximises welfare. A more rules-based, or highly parameterised approach, to monetary policy would provide less scope to respond in this way. Flexibility also means that the Board faces choices and trade-offs. For example, when supply shocks occur, there can be a short-term trade-off between inflation and growth. And in other circumstances, there can be a trade-off between achieving an inflation objective in the short term, via lower interest rates, and the build-up of macroeconomic and financial stability risks. Our legislation provides the scope to make these often difficult choices in the national interest. There is, though, a question here about accountability. Given the flexibility, the Bank's performance is sometimes hard to judge at any single point in time. This can complicate the task of holding us to account. Given this, it is important that the Bank explains when trade-offs are being made, including how and why. I hope the Review will provide a further opportunity to examine how the RBA has managed these trade-offs in the past and how it might manage and explain them in the future. I would now like to turn to the Board's monetary policy decisions over recent months. The Board is committed to doing what is necessary to ensure that inflation returns to target over time. High inflation is a scourge. It damages our standard of living, creates additional uncertainty for households and businesses, erodes the value of people's savings and adds to inequality. And without price stability, it is not possible to achieve a sustained period of low unemployment. It is important, therefore, that this current surge in inflation is only temporary and that we once again return to the 2 to 3 per cent range. The Board is committed to the return of inflation to target. It is seeking to do this in a way that keeps the economy on an even keel; it is possible to achieve this, but the path here is a narrow one and it is clouded in uncertainty. I would like to highlight three sources of this uncertainty. The first is the global economic environment. In the United States, the Federal Reserve has indicated that a period of tight monetary policy and below-trend growth will be required to get inflation under control. In Europe, real incomes are suffering very big declines because of sharply higher energy costs, and this will weigh on spending and growth. And in China, the economy is being affected by the authorities' approach to COVID, major stresses in its property industry and drought in parts of the country. Some slowing in the global economy will help bring inflation down, but a sharp slowing would make the job of delivering a soft landing here in Australia much harder. The second source of uncertainty is domestic in nature - and that is how inflation expectations and the inflation psychology in Australia adjust to the period of high inflation. If workers and businesses come to expect higher inflation, and wages growth and price-setting behaviour adjusts accordingly, the task of navigating that narrow path will be very difficult, if not impossible. A shift higher in inflation expectations will require higher interest rates. In time that would mean a sharper slowing of the economy. It is in our national interest that we avoid this. The third source of uncertainty is how households respond to higher interest rates. Interest rates are increasing for the first time in 12 years and they are rising quickly. The full effects of this are still to be felt. Household budgets are also under pressure from higher inflation, and housing prices are declining after large gains (Graph 8). On the other hand, many households have built up large financial buffers, including through offset accounts, and the household saving rate remains higher than it was before the pandemic. Many households are also benefiting from the strong labour market, with a higher share of Australians having a job than ever before. It is still difficult to know how all of these factors will balance out, but recent data continue to suggest resilience in consumer spending. We are paying close attention to these various uncertainties, but also recognise that there have been a number of developments that should prove helpful in navigating the narrow path. The first is that the supply side of the global economy is gradually improving and the demand for goods is stabilising - which means that a better balance of supply and demand is being established. Shipping costs are declining and delivery times have shortened (Graph 9). Many commodity prices have also reversed their rises following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It is also noteworthy that inflation expectations in Australia remain consistent with the inflation target. In addition, wages growth has picked up, but not nearly to the same extent as in the United States (Graph 10). This is an important difference. While there are some areas where wages are rising very quickly in Australia, aggregate growth in wages has not responded materially to the higher inflation and is not inconsistent with inflation returning to target over time. It is important that this remains the case and that we avoid the cycle of higher inflation leading to higher wages growth and then higher inflation - a cycle like that would end in higher interest rates and a sharper slowing in the economy. It is in this environment in which we have been increasing interest rates. Since May, the Board has raised the cash rate target by a cumulative 2 1/4 percentage points, including a 1/2 percentage point rise earlier this week (Graph 11). This increase in interest rates - from what was a historically low level - is to ensure that the current period of high inflation is only temporary and that a more sustainable balance between demand and supply is established. To repeat an earlier point, price stability is necessary for a strong economy and a sustained period of full employment. So, it is important that we achieve this. The Board expects that further increases in interest rates will be required over the months ahead. The Board is not on a pre-set path, especially given the uncertainties that I have spoken about. We are conscious that there are lags in the operation of monetary policy and that interest rates have increased very quickly. And we recognise that, all else equal, the case for a slower pace of increase in interest rates becomes stronger as the level of the cash rate rises. But how high interest rates need to go and how quickly we get there will be guided by the incoming data and the evolving outlook for inflation and the labour market. Thank you very much for listening and for supporting the Anika Foundation. I look forward to answering your questions.","['inflation', 'monetary', 'macroeconomic', 'economy', 'anika']","['flexible inflation', 'inflation view', 'inflation strong', 'achieving inflation', 'pick inflation']","['view flexible inflation', 'improve understanding inflation', 'approach flexible inflation', 'adopted flexible inflation', 'flexible inflation targeting']","['flexible inflation', 'flexible inflation target', 'recent higher inflation', 'overall inflation dynamics', 'higher inflation']"
896,r220908a_BOC,canada,2022-09-08,Getting inflation back to normal,rogers,0,"Speaking a day after the Bank of Canada raised interest rates, Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Rogers discusses where the economy stands and what the Bank is doing to get inflation back under control. We decided to raise the policy interest rate by 75 basis points to 3.25% and continue quantitative tightening. Over the summer, the consumer price index dropped slightly--to 7.6% in July from 8.1% in June. While overall inflation may have peaked, most of the drop was due to gasoline prices. Inflation has continued to rise and broaden across goods and services. And globally, we're still seeing supply chain bottlenecks and high commodity prices, both of which contribute to inflation here in Canada. Domestically, demand continues to outpace supply. Consumer spending, particularly on services, was robust in the second quarter of 2022. And significant labour shortages persist, with the unemployment rate at its lowest level ever. While housing resales and house prices dropped from unsustainably high levels, the Canadian economy remains in excess demand, and inflation is more and more broad-based. We know that, for many Canadians, higher rates add to the burden they already face with high inflation. Still, we need to raise interest rates to bring inflation down. Inflation won't come down overnight. Monetary policy works like a chain reaction or sequence of events--a sequence that takes time. Changes to the Bank's policy rate affect different households and sectors of the economy differently and at different speeds. The housing market is one sector where higher rates are felt immediately. But it takes longer for interest rates to bring down price growth on things that aren't directly tied to borrowing. Given the lag between changes to interest rates and their impact on inflation--and the considerable uncertainty surrounding the outlook--getting inflation all the way back to 2% will take some time. We also know there could be bumps along the way."" With inflation well above our 2% target and short-term inflation expectations remaining high, elevated inflation could become entrenched. By front-loading interest rate increases now, we're trying to avoid the need for even higher interest rates and a more pronounced slowing of the economy down the road. Going forward, we'll pay close attention to three areas of particular interest: Given the outlook for inflation, we continue to judge that the policy interest rate will need to rise further. As the effects of tighter monetary policy work through the economy, we will assess how much higher interest rates need to go to return inflation to target. We have a careful eye on many different things--we have a lot of work ahead of us, and we will not rest easy until we can get inflation back to target.""

7676,r220909a_FOMC,united states,2022-09-09,The Economic Outlook: Time to Let the Data Do the Talking,waller,0,"Thank you, Klaus, and thank you for the invitation to speak at this workshop, which I have been attending since its very beginning in 2004. Something that I love about this conference that has kept me coming back almost every year is its tradition of open inquiry and even some fun, on the one hand, combined with rigorous, critical analysis, on the other. I am a supporter, and I guess a practitioner, of rigorous criticism, because, as you may have heard, the conference award given each year for ""outstanding critic"" was named for me. Based on the standard I set, the person who wins the award is also known as the ""most annoying participant."" I suppose it was only karma that a guy like me who likes to dish out the criticism would end up in a job that receives plenty of it. Kidding aside, I do consider being the namesake for this award a great honor, and just to make sure I don't get too much of a swelled head, by tradition the conference organizers purposefully misspell my name. My subject today is the outlook for the U.S. economy and the Federal Reserve's ongoing campaign to bring down inflation and achieve our 2 percent objective. are three takeaways from my speech today. First, inflation is far too high, and it is too soon to say whether inflation is moving meaningfully and persistently downward. The inflation back down to our 2 percent target. This is a fight we cannot, and will not, walk away from. The second takeaway is that the fears of a recession starting in the first half of this year have faded away and the robust U.S. labor market is giving us the flexibility to be aggressive in our fight against inflation. For that reason, I support continued increases in the FOMC's policy rate and, based on what I know today, I support a  significant increase at our next meeting on September 20 and 21 to get the policy rate to a setting that is clearly restricting demand. The final takeaway is that I believe forward guidance is becoming less useful at this stage of the tightening cycle. Future decisions on the size of additional rate increases and the destination for the policy rate in this cycle should be solely determined by the incoming data and their implications for economic activity, employment, and inflation. Based on all of the data that we have received since the FOMC's last meeting, I believe the policy decision at our next meeting will be straightforward. Because of the strong labor market, right now there is no tradeoff between the Fed's employment and inflation objectives, so we will continue to aggressively fight inflation. Inflation is widespread, driven by strong demand that has only begun to moderate, by an ongoing lag in labor force participation, and by supply chain problems that may be improving in some areas but are still considerable. For these reasons, I expect it will take some time before inflation moves back to our 2 percent goal, and that the FOMC will be tightening policy into 2023. But the answers to questions of ""how high?"" and ""for how long?"" will depend solely on incoming data. Since I last spoke in July, I think the argument that we entered a recession in the first half of 2022 has pretty much ended--we didn't. With each passing week, the absence of any indication of a recession in spending or employment data buries that recession argument a little deeper. We understand some of the factors that lowered the gross domestic product (GDP) numbers in the first half, and a debate continues about other possible factors, such as mismeasurement, potentially underreporting GDP. What we can say is that after the Fed telegraphed its policy pivot to tightening in the latter  months of 2021 and began raising rates in the first quarter of this year, demand and economic activity slowed in the first half of 2022 from the strong pace of 2021. Data suggest an uptick in consumption growth in the third quarter. Meanwhile, the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model forecasts real GDP will grow 2.6 percent this quarter, though other estimates are a touch below this prediction. Spending data are supportive of continued expansion. Nominal retail sales overall were flat in July, but that is mainly because falling gasoline and auto prices--which is good news--held back sales in those sectors. Excluding that, retail sales rose 0.7 percent, suggesting that discretionary spending grew solidly. Businesses also continued to expand production and spending. Total industrial production increased 0.6 percent in July, standing 3.9 percent above its level a year ago. Forward-looking indicators of manufacturing activity, such as new orders indexes in various manufacturing surveys, are softer than earlier in the year, but most (and in particular the positive August reading from the ISM) are not suggestive of a material pullback in manufacturing activity. Meanwhile, the non- manufacturing ISM report suggests continuing growth, with its new orders index rising to a solid level last month. But there are signs of moderation in economic activity, which is what the FOMC is trying to achieve by tightening monetary policy. Not surprisingly, higher interest rates this year are slowing activity in the housing market. There have been declines in construction of single-family homes for a number of months, with permits and home starts both decreasing in July. Sales of existing and new single-family homes have also slowed. Existing home sales fell by 5.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.8 million homes in July. While the imbalance between housing supply and demand  remains significant, it has meaningfully improved. The inventory of unsold new and existing homes has more than doubled since January. While the three months supply of existing home is still below levels before the pandemic, the eleven months of new home inventory is the highest since the spring of 2009. This latter statistic has raised concerns by some about a significant downturn looming in the housing market, but an important caveat is that much of the current elevated inventory reflects the recent low rate of housing completion due to continued supply constraints. Many of these new homes for sale are still under construction, and as supply constraints ease, builders will be able deliver more completed homes to a market where the supply of existing homes remains tight. All that said, the housing market is a significant channel for monetary policy, and I will be watching this sector carefully. The FOMC's goal is that the tightening in monetary policy slows aggregate demand so that it is in better alignment with supply across all sectors of the economy. My expectation is that strong household savings, the tight labor market, and additional availability of manufactured goods as supply chains constraints continue to resolve will allow households to make long-awaited purchases, which will provide a partial offset to tighter policy. That will support a slowing, rather than a contraction, in demand. Turning to the very strong labor market, private payroll employment has been increasing at an average of nearly 400,000 a month over the last several months. Unemployment rose two tenths of a percent in August to 3.7 percent, in part reflecting an increase in the labor force participation rate, but still stands at a very low level. The increase in participation was welcome news, but this rate is still far below that achieved before the pandemic, when unemployment was roughly as low as today. We are facing  worker shortages in many sectors of the economy. Job openings have started to decline a bit but remain very elevated. These data confirm that the Fed is hitting its full employment mandate, so all my attention is on bringing inflation down. Inflation slowed in July, which was a very encouraging development. Headline inflation for both the consumer price index and the index derived from personal consumption expenditures (PCE)--the Fed's preferred measure--slowed, largely due to continuing declines in prices for gasoline and other petroleum products. Excluding volatile energy and food prices, core inflation for these two indexes also stepped down from the rapid increases of earlier this year, but it is still too early to say that inflation is moving meaningfully and persistently downward. Inflation is still widespread. For both headline and core inflation, at least 60 percent of the underlying categories of different goods and services increased by 3 percent or more. Prices for housing services are elevated and still rising. Core goods inflation continues to run well above its pre-pandemic level. Inflation for services excluding housing has moved up this past year in part due to consumers shifting back to more normal activities outside the household as social distancing has eased. Looking ahead, I will be focusing on a number of factors that will influence inflation. On housing services--rent and the so-called owners' equivalent rent --I expect to see sizable increases in this component of inflation for a while as the recent rise in new rentals makes its way into aggregate price measures. In a speech in March, I noted that, based on various measures of asking rents, some analysts were predicting that the rate of  rent inflation in the consumer price index could double in 2022, and so far it is on pace to more than double. Owners-equivalent rent is similarly on pace to nearly double this year. Sometime early next year, though, I expect to see the upward pressure on inflation from these forces to ease as future increases in new or renewed leases moderate and the full effects of monetary policy tightening make their way to housing services prices. Beyond housing, I expect goods price inflation to continue to moderate as monetary policy now and going forward slows the pace of increase in aggregate demand, supply problems ease, and supply and demand come into better balance. There is some evidence that goods supply production and delivery problems tied to the pandemic are improving, with supplier delivery times and reports of items in short supply continuing to drop. In terms of service price inflation, we saw a step-down in airfares and other travel-related services last month, but I am uncertain about how these services, as well as food services, and nonmarket services prices will evolve going forward. Nominal wages have been growing quickly, and I'll be watching closely to see how wage growth evolves and feeds into inflation. The Atlanta Fed's Wage Growth Tracker hit another record in July for its 24 years of data, a 12-month rate of 6.7 percent wage growth. I don't expect wage increases to ease up much unless and until there is a significant softening in the labor market. One way to anticipate future wage growth is through quit rates. Most people who quit their jobs are moving to others that pay significantly better, so I take quits as one signal about where wages are headed in the near  term. Quits are near their highest level over the 22 years that the government has tracked them, but they have come down from the start of this year, and further decreases would bring them closer to the level they were at immediately before the pandemic, when wages were growing much more slowly than today. Another factor that I will be watching closely is longer-term inflation expectations, which I believe significantly influence inflation. As inflation moved higher over the past year and a half, measures of short-term inflation expectations moved up notably, but measures of longer-term expectations rose only a little and generally stand near levels seen in the years before the pandemic, when inflation was low. In fact, several measures of longer-term expectations have edged lower over the past couple of months. To me, this means that the public retains confidence that the Fed will be able to rein in inflation in the medium term. To sum up, while I welcome promising news about inflation, I don't yet see convincing evidence that it is moving meaningfully and persistently down along a trajectory to reach our 2 percent target. I keep in mind that a year ago we saw similarly promising evidence of inflation moderating for several months before it jumped up to a high and then very high level. Those earlier inflation readings probably delayed our pivot to tightening monetary policy by a few months. The consequences of being fooled by a temporary softening in inflation could be even greater now if another misjudgment damages the Fed's credibility. So, until I see a meaningful and persistent moderation of the rise in core prices, I will support taking significant further steps to tighten monetary policy.  Now let me lay out the implications of this outlook for monetary policy. Since March, the FOMC has raised our policy target range from near zero to between 2 1/4 and 2 1/2 percent. That puts the upper bound of the current target range at the median of FOMC participants' longer-run projection for the policy rate, as recorded in the June participants think the policy rate would settle when the economy is growing at its potential and inflation is at our 2 percent target. This is a good definition of success when employment and inflation are near our goals and no help is needed from monetary policy. But that isn't the case now; inflation is far from our goal, so more action is needed. The policy rate will have to move meaningfully above this neutral level to further restrain aggregate demand and put more downward pressure on prices. Looking ahead to our next meeting, I support another significant increase in the policy rate. But, looking further out, I can't tell you about the appropriate path of policy. The peak range and how fast we will move there will depend on data we will receive about the economy. Earlier this year, when we were ending asset purchases, inflation was quite elevated, and we were lifting the target range off the effective lower bound, so it made sense to provide forward guidance to help convey the urgency the FOMC felt about tightening monetary policy. Forward guidance was useful in helping the public understand how quickly we expected to tighten, and we saw longer-term interest rates move up quite rapidly as a result of these communications. And additional hikes should lead to further restraint in aggregate demand. As we continue to raise rates, we need to see, month by month, how households and businesses are adjusting to the tighter financial conditions, and how that adjustment is affecting inflation. We shouldn't be  estimating what the peak level of the target range will be and how quickly we will get there, because those details are much more dependent on what new economic data tell us than was the case when the only direction for the federal funds rate to go was up--and up by a lot. This is not to suggest that I anticipate rate increases stopping very soon. I expect that getting inflation to fall meaningfully and persistently toward our 2 percent target will require increases in the target range for the federal funds rate until at least early next year. But don't ask me about the policy path because I truly don't know--it will depend on the data. Six months ago, I would not have thought that we would be where we are today, with inflation so far from our target, after significantly tightening policy with a series of large rate increases and by shrinking the balance sheet. There are a range of possibilities for how the economy will perform, however, and we can talk about the implications of that range. Say, for example, that inflation follows the path laid out in the June SEP, which has core PCE inflation falling to 4.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022 and then moving toward 2 percent over 2023 and 2024. In that case, I would support our policy rate peaking near 4 percent. But based on the experience of the past year and half, it would be foolish to express great confidence that this plausible path will come to pass. Instead, it is important to consider the range of possibilities and the appropriate policy responses. For example, if inflation does not moderate or rises further this year, then, in my view, the policy rate will probably need to move well above 4 percent. Alternatively, if inflation suddenly decelerates, then, in my view, the policy rate might peak at less than 4 percent.  One thing that is more predictable and has a significant effect on tightening policy over time is the shrinking of the Fed's holdings of assets as maturing securities run off our balance sheet. Starting this month, the Fed is shedding $60 billion a month in Treasury securities and up to $35 billion a month in agency mortgage-backed securities. This action effectively increases the supply of securities in the hands of private investors and will thus put upward pressure on interest rates, as private investors must now be enticed to hold these assets. All told, the FOMC has taken unprecedented and decisive policy actions this year to quickly increase the policy rate in response to high inflation. But where we stand now is not good enough. Though the labor market is strong, inflation is too elevated. So I support another significant hike in two weeks. After that, the tightening path will continue until we see clear and convincing evidence that inflation is moving meaningfully and persistently down to our 2 percent target. The pace of tightening is uncertain; it will depend on the data. No matter what, I am ready and willing to do what it takes to bring inflation down.","['conference', 'critic', 'criticism', 'award', 'speech']","['conference award', 'outstanding critic', 'namesake award', 'takeaways speech', 'award great']","['criticism heard conference', 'conference award given', 'heard conference award', 'year outstanding critic', 'award known annoying']","['conference award', 'outstanding critic', 'conference', 'speech today', 'conference organizers']"
3230,r220912a_ECB,euro area,2022-09-12,Reconciling the macro and micro evidence on the effects of monetary policy,schnabel,0,"I would like to welcome you all very warmly to the seventh ECB Annual Research Conference. After two years of holding this conference virtually, we are very happy to see many of you in person - thank you so much for coming to Frankfurt. An equally warm welcome to those of you who can only join us online. Thanks to Luc and his team, we have an exciting programme with high-quality research papers on important topics. One set of presentations will help us to better understand business cycle dynamics and the effects of monetary policy. The focus will be on price rigidities in microeconomic data, the role of temporary layoffs for unemployment dynamics, the effect of macroeconomic uncertainty on household spending decisions and the potential crowding out of bank lending by quantitative easing policies. We will also hear about a new econometric methodology for constructing monetary policy counterfactuals. Another group of presentations will cover structural changes in the economy, in particular the data economy and automation, and what they imply for the functioning of our economy and monetary policy. The two highlights of the conference will be the Jean Monnet Lecture by Jean Tirole and the debate about the outlook for inflation in the euro area, as seen from the outside, with Paul Krugman and Lawrence Summers, moderated by Beatrice Weder di Mauro. In my remarks today, I will discuss how recent research, including that presented here, helps us to understand the transmission of our monetary policy. I will argue that we have made considerable progress in combining the evidence obtained from micro price data and the macro evidence on the effects of monetary policy. This gives us a better understanding of how monetary policy affects inflation and economic activity, thereby supporting our efforts to properly respond to the current situation. In the wake of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the global economy has been experiencing strong inflationary pressure together with very large relative price changes. These developments contrast sharply with the preceding long period of subdued inflation. In the euro area, HICP inflation had for many years been below our 2% target. When the pandemic hit, the inflation rate fell even further, going into negative territory for a period of five months at the end of 2020. I remember an interview with an Austrian newspaper in early 2021 when I was asked by the journalist whether positive inflation still existed at all. I assured him that inflation was not dead, pointing to the expected increase in inflation over the year - without anticipating what was about to happen. Inflation indeed rebounded and began its sharp upward move, to 5% by the end of that year and, according to preliminary data, further to 9.1% last month. And inflation may rise further in the near term. While all HICP components added to this high number, energy price inflation in the euro area is standing at close to 40%, illustrating the magnitude of relative price changes in the recent period. Central banks around the world are responding forcefully to these developments. The ECB raised its policy rates by 50 basis points in July and by another 75 basis points last week. Based on our current assessment, over the Governing Council's next several meetings, we expect to raise interest rates further towards levels that will ensure the timely return of inflation to our 2% medium-term target. The current normalisation phase refocuses the attention of monetary policymakers on one of the classic questions in macroeconomics: how do central bank policy rates affect inflation and aggregate economic activity? Over the past 40 years, economists have made significant progress in answering this question. I would like to summarise the key lessons learned and pose a few questions that remain open. One stream of the literature investigates the effects of policy rates using macro data, time-series econometric models and dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models. A broad consensus has emerged about the aggregate effects of interest rate policy. The econometric models, mainly structural vector autoregressions, show that policy rate changes have significant effects on both inflation and economic activity. Maximum effects occur with a lag, with the impact on inflation taking somewhat longer to materialise than the impact on the real economy. Furthermore, at least at times when inflation is not too far from the 2% target, the models indicate that the effect on inflation tends to be modest relative to the effect on the real economy. In other words, the Phillips curve is rather flat. DSGE models can replicate the effects of interest rate changes found in the macro data, shedding some light on the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. With the advent of more and more granular data, research shifted its focus to micro data on prices. Researchers documented how individual firms set prices, aiming at building models that would be consistent with both the price-setting behaviour at the micro level and the effects of monetary policy in the macro data. Meeting these two objectives simultaneously proved challenging. When economists studied the micro data underlying the consumer price index in the United States and other countries, they found that individual price changes are infrequent but typically large in absolute terms, in the order of 10%. In their famous paper ""Menu Costs and Phillips Curves"", Mikhail Golosov and Robert Lucas investigated the implications of this evidence for the effects of monetary policy in a dynamic equilibrium model with idiosyncratic shocks and a fixed cost of nominal price changes. When calibrated to match the average frequency and size of price changes in the micro data in a low-inflation environment, the model predicted monetary policy having a strong effect on inflation and a weak effect on output - that is a Phillips curve, in contrast to the relationship found in the macro data. The key reason behind this result was the ""selection effect"". In a menu cost model, after a change in the policy rate, prices further away from their optimum adjust sooner than others. In the Golosov-Lucas model, this selection effect is quite strong. When the policy rate rises, prices previously far above the optimum decrease by large amounts, while substantial price increases that were about to occur are postponed. Therefore, in that model, price changes are infrequent, but monetary policy has a strong effect on inflation and a weak effect on the real economy. In order to reconcile these partly contradictory findings, more work was required to match the evidence from the micro price data and the macro evidence regarding the effects of monetary policy. Since the Golosov-Lucas paper was published, economists have been studying numerous micro price datasets from different countries. Researchers have been busy constructing models that can match various features of the micro data, including the average frequency and size of price changes. In 2018 the European System of Central Banks established PRISMA - the Price-setting Microdata Analysis Network - to collect and study various kinds of micro data, aiming to deepen our understanding of price-setting behaviour and inflation dynamics. Today, Peter Karadi will present the findings from a research project undertaken as part of the PRISMA network. In the paper, Peter and his co-authors Raphael Schoenle and Jesse Wursten set out to measure the selection effect in micro data. To give you a preview of their findings in a nutshell, the selection effect is absent. The probability that a given price will change increases, to a certain extent, when that price is further from the optimum. However, the probability of price adjustment does not seem to depend on the distance from the optimum. The authors also discuss which models can match such price-setting behaviour. The promising candidates are state-dependent models with random menu costs and models of information-constrained price-setting. In both classes of models, the selection effect can be weak: some prices fail to adjust even though the distance from the optimum may be large, while other prices change despite that distance being small. The transmission of monetary policy in these models depends not only on nominal rigidities governed by the frequency of price changes and the selection effect, but also on whether a change in the policy rate triggers large or small price adjustments. ""Real rigidities"" are features of the economy that dampen the size of these price adjustments. Think of real wage rigidity, sticky intermediate input prices or inattention to inflation. Models with a weak selection effect and with real rigidities conditional on an aggregate shock imply that policy rate changes have a modest effect on inflation compared with their effect on economic activity, suggesting that the Phillips curve is rather flat. These models therefore meet the challenge of matching both the micro price data and the macro evidence on the effects of monetary policy. At the same time, the evidence I have summarised so far comes from the period when inflation rates were fairly stable and not far from 2%. Would we expect the same patterns in an environment of high inflation? For example, a prominent analysis of the US micro price data from the Great Inflation of the 1970s and early 1980s finds a substantial increase in the frequency of price changes. This was a period when the inflation rate remained above 5% for many years and inflation expectations were not well anchored. Similarly, model-based simulations from the PRISMA network show that, in the euro area, the frequency of price changes increases with the inflation rate - something that we are indeed observing today, with a historically high share of firms expecting to increase their prices over the coming months. According to these simulations, a material increase in the slope of the Phillips curve may occur if inflation were to stay persistently above a certain threshold for an extended period, once again challenging previous findings. Let me conclude. Recent research, to be presented today, suggests that the slope of the Phillips curve may depend on the inflation environment, with the curve potentially becoming steeper when inflation is high. The evidence is still scarce, however, and more research is needed. Moreover, numerous questions remain unanswered. How high and how persistent does inflation need to be for the frequency of price changes to increase significantly? How would this affect the strength of the selection effect? And could real rigidities become weaker, for example because real wages adjust faster or price-setters pay more attention to inflation? Improving our grasp of these issues is essential to foster our understanding of the effects of monetary policy. Research is the backbone of good policymaking - and we count on you helping us to advance our knowledge of these fundamental issues, which helps us to deliver on our mandate of price stability. Thank you very much for your attention, and I wish you an interesting and productive conference.","['macroeconomics', 'macroeconomic', 'inflationary', 'inflation', 'economists']","['economy monetary', 'monetary policy', 'monetary policymakers', 'inflation euro', 'inflation economic']","['economy monetary policy', 'monetary policy research', 'monetary policy counterfactuals', 'monetary policy highlights', 'monetary policy macro']","['monetary policy counterfactuals', 'monetary policy', 'monetary policymakers', 'inflation dynamics', 'inflation environment']"
4943,r220913a_SNB,switzerland,2022-09-13,Carl Menger Award Ceremony 2022: Introductory remarks,jordan,1,"I welcome you all to the ceremony of the Carl Menger Award, given by the Verein fur Socialpolitik. I do so in the name of the sponsors of the award, namely the Deutsche Bundesbank, the Oesterreichische Nationalbank and the Swiss National Bank, as well as on behalf of the selection committee. This important award is given in recognition of outstanding research work relating to monetary economics and monetary policy. The city selected as the venue for this year's Annual Conference of the Verein fur Socialpolitik has a very special appeal to central banks. Basel has hosted the BIS, the bank of central banks, since its creation in 1930. In a way, Basel can be considered as the capital of central banks. I regularly travel to the BIS to meet my peers from all over the world and to discuss matters at the heart of monetary policymaking. Today I am in Basel not for a BIS meeting but rather for an important celebratory academic occasion. I am very honoured to present the 2022 Carl Menger Award to our friend, Professor School of Economics. The name of his chair says a great deal about today's award winner. Ricardo is a researcher who has dedicated his career to answering questions of great relevance to central banks and monetary policy, and more often than not, his work has a link to the Phillips curve, still one of the key relationships for central banks. Contenders for the Carl Menger Award face two constraints: They must teach at a European university, and they must be no older than 45. Considering the number and quality of Ricardo's contributions to the literature, you might be surprised to learn that he meets the second criterion. But when you see him in person, you could easily believe that he is even younger. This curiosity is the proof that Ricardo's career has been exceptional. It began 20 years ago, when he published two ground-breaking papers at the tender age of 24. The focus of the first paper, co-authored with Greg Mankiw in 2002, was sticky information versus sticky prices. In the second paper, written with Mankiw and Justin Wolfers in 2003, Ricardo noted that progress in studying expectations depends on the examination of survey data. Importantly, it is not only the average of the expectations that matters, but also the distribution of disagreement across people, and its evolution over time. Ricardo's research has shaped our understanding of expectations as drivers of inflation. Such work could not be more topical today. But have central bankers followed Ricardo's advice by looking at movements in the distribution of expectations? In a working paper published in June this year, Ricardo analyses how and why several countries are experiencing a sharp increase of inflation. He highlights a range of factors. One of these is the neglect of using expectations data in the way he recommended. While household inflation expectations seemed solidly anchored in 2021, closer inspection reveals that a significant change in expectations was already underway. Expectations, in other words, were not as well-anchored as had been supposed. Ricardo has investigated other topics of great importance to central bank policies. Let me mention just three papers. In the first, again co-authored with Mankiw and published in the Journal of the European Economic Association in 2003, the issue was what measure of inflation a central bank should target. The conclusion was the following: In order to achieve maximum stability of economic activity, a central bank should use a price index that gives substantial weight to the level of nominal wages. The question of the correct measure of inflation has grown in importance over the years, partly due to the observed difference between the development of consumer prices and asset prices. In the second paper, published in the Journal of Economic Perspectives in 2013, Ricardo explored the appropriate design of a central bank, drawing on the relevant literature and historical experience. He discussed twelve dimensions and derived recommendations for optimal central bank design. One recommendation is that society should give central banks a clear goal focused on price stability in the long run. In the third paper, published as a chapter in the Oxford Handbook of the Economics of Central Banking in 2019, Ricardo concluded that central banks have a limited scope for lowering the fiscal burden. This message is particularly important in times of sharply rising public deficits and debts. I would like to personally congratulate Professor Reis on this award as well as on behalf of the members of the expert panel and my colleagues at the Bundesbank and the Oesterreichische Nationalbank. I hope that Ricardo pursues his prolific studies and further expands our knowledge of how central banks can achieve their mandates. I wish him every success, and that his citations curve will go on exhibiting an impressive slope. I am sure central bankers will continue to benefit from his lucid work. Please join me now in a warm round of applause as I ask Professor Reis to join me on stage. Every two years, the Verein fur Socialpolitik confers the Carl Menger Award for innovative international research in the areas of monetary macroeconomics and monetary policy.

3231,r220914a_ECB,euro area,2022-09-14,Monetary policy and the money market,lane,0,"It is a pleasure to open this meeting of the ECB's While the money market is always central to the transmission of monetary policy, its role is especially prominent when the set of policy interest rates is the main active monetary policy instrument. After an extended period in which policy rates were stable near the lower bound and asset purchasing was the marginal monetary policy instrument, the money market is now back to centre stage in the transmission of monetary policy and the MMCG is an excellent forum to collect feedback from you, the money market practitioners. In these opening remarks, I will first explain the monetary policy decisions we took last week, before turning to the transmission of our recent interest rate moves in the money market. The Governing Council last week decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 75 basis points. This major step frontloads the transition from the prevailing highly accommodative level of policy rates towards levels that will ensure the timely return of inflation to our two per cent medium-term target. Based on our current assessment, we expect that this transition will require us to continue to raise interest rates over the next several meetings. This policy path will dampen demand and guard against the risk of a persistent upward shift in inflation expectations. We will regularly re-evaluate our policy path in light of incoming information and the evolving inflation outlook. Our future policy rate decisions will continue to be data-dependent and follow a meeting-by-meeting approach. We took last week's decision, and expect to raise interest rates further, because inflation remains far too high and is likely to stay above our target for an extended period. The new staff projections foresee inflation to average 8.1 per cent in 2022, 5.5 per cent in 2023 and 2.3 per cent in 2024. This is a substantial revision relative to the June staff projections: 2022 inflation has been revised up by 1.3 percentage points, 2023 inflation by 2.0 percentage points and 2024 inflation by 0.2 percentage points. The most important driver of these upward revisions is the exceptional increases in the assumptions for wholesale prices for gas and electricity over the coming months. In addition, faster growth in nominal wages - reflecting some catch up to the price level increases that have already occurred and also the improvement in the labour market - is also a significant contributor to higher and more persistent inflation, while exchange rate depreciation has also added to price pressures. At the same time, the staff projections continue to see a steep reduction in inflation over the projection horizon. While core inflation is expected to remain at elevated levels until the middle of 2023, it is expected to decline thereafter as re-opening effects subside and as supply bottlenecks and energy input cost pressures ease. The projected decline in inflation is also supported by the indicators that suggest that most measures of longer-term inflation expectations currently stand at around two per cent, although recent above-target revisions to some indicators warrant continued monitoring. In terms of the risk assessment, the risks to the inflation outlook are primarily on the upside. The major risk in the short term is a further disruption of energy supplies. Over the medium term, inflation may turn out to be higher than expected because of a persistent worsening of the production capacity of the euro area economy, further increases in energy and food prices, a rise in inflation expectations above our target, or higher than anticipated wage rises. However, if energy costs were to decline or demand were to weaken over the medium term, it would lower pressures on prices. This inflation outlook forms the context for the setting of monetary policy. Last week's decision is closely linked to our monetary policy strategy, which stipulates that the appropriate monetary policy response to a deviation of inflation from the symmetric two per cent target is context-specific and depends on the origin, magnitude and persistence of the deviation. In the context of a long projected period with inflation far above target, the net upside risks to inflation and taking into account that the current setting of the key policy rates is still highly accommodative, it was appropriate to take a major step that frontloads the transition from the prevailing highly-accommodative level of policy rates towards levels that will support a timely return of inflation to our target. Moreover, all else being equal, in calibrating a multi-step transition path, the appropriate size of an individual increment will be larger, the wider the gap to the terminal rate and the more skewed the risks to the inflation target. At the same time, it is crystal clear that the appropriate monetary policy for the euro area should continue to take into account that the energy shock remains a dominant driving force of inflation dynamics and the general economic outlook, including through the impact of the very significant terms of trade deterioration. In particular, the inflation dynamics associated with the energy shock component, to which the euro area is particularly exposed, are of a different nature compared to demand-driven overheating dynamics. The money market is key for the implementation and transmission of monetary policy: it acts as a seismograph for liquidity conditions and market expectations of future policy, while money market rates are central to the transmission of monetary policy through their impact on economy-wide financing conditions. It follows that it is important that money market rates adjust in line with changes in key ECB interest rates. This applies in particular to changes in the deposit facility rate (DFR), which represents the relevant policy rate in conditions of excess liquidity. The available evidence suggests that our July rate hike of 50 basis points, which increased the DFR from -0.5 per cent to zero, has been well transmitted to money market rates overall. In particular, the euro short-term rate (EURSTR) moved up by the full size of the change in policy rates (Chart 1). This is especially important, since the EURSTR is the basis for the overnight interest rate swap curve, along which the market prices expectations of future policy. The reaction was similar across deposits by banks and by the different types of non-bank financial institutions that are active in the money market. The near-complete adjustment of repo rates for transactions based on a broad collateral pool - which are predominantly driven by a motivation to borrow or lend cash - was immediate. The July 2022 rate hike by 50 basis points and rate changes across money market rates segments Notes: General collateral (GC) and refers to cash-driven repo transactions and non-general (non-GC) refers to collateral-driven repo transactions. The bars show the difference between the average rate of the period 1-26 July (before the hike) and the period 27 July-19 August (after the hike). For 1-month government bills, the bars show the difference in the respective rate between the average rate of the period 10 - 27 June (before the hike) and the period 27 July - 11 August (after the hike). At the same time, repo rates for transactions using specific collateral - which are driven by the need to source a specific security - have increased by slightly less than 50 basis points as collateral scarcity has implied some downward pressure on these rates. This collateral scarcity is reflected in persistent negative spreads of some short-term repo rates to EURSTR, which is particularly pronounced for the non-general collateral (non-GC) rates (Chart 2). Average spread of short-term repo rates to EURSTR over 2022 Notes: GC refers to general collateral and cash-driven repo transactions. Non-GC refers to non-general collateral and collateral-driven repo transactions. The chart displays the average spread of the respective repo rate to the EURSTR since the beginning of 2022. The latest observations are for 13 September 2022. Moreover, there has been a widening of the spread between short-term government bill rates and swaps with the same maturity (Chart 1). This can be mainly attributed to demand/supply imbalances in the market for short-term government bills, which is partially driven by the level of excess liquidity and increased demand for short-term high-quality assets. This increased demand is also motivated by the current interest rate uncertainty and high level of volatility. These demand/supply imbalances of high-quality collateral with short-term maturities can also be observed in other jurisdictions of major central banks for similar reasons. The increase of the DFR by 75 basis points to 0.75 per cent that we decided last week will only become effective with the start of the new maintenance period today. To preserve the effective transmission of last week's rate hike by 75 basis points and safeguard the orderly functioning of money markets, the Governing Council also decided last week to temporarily remove the zero per cent interest rate ceiling for remunerating government deposits held with the Eurosystem. Until 30 April 2023, the remuneration ceiling government deposits will remain at the EURSTR or the DFR, whichever is lower. This temporary adjustment was in recognition that the faster than initially expected pace of monetary policy normalisation gave only little time for government deposit holders to adjust and plan for alternative arrangements. The temporary adjustment allows the remuneration of government deposits to follow money market rates, which reduces the risk of an abrupt outflow of these deposits held on the Eurosystem balance sheet into the market -- likely into repos or short-term government securities. This, in turn, could have created additional demand for highly-rated euro collateral, at a time when some segments of money markets, in particular the market for euro area repo and short-term government securities, are showing signs of collateral scarcity (Chart 2). The early indications are that the decision on the remuneration of government deposits has been effective. Following the announcement of the change in the remuneration of non-monetary policy deposits, the recent increase in the spread between the yield for short-term euro government securities and interest rate swaps has been partially reversed. (Chart 3). At the same time, as the change in the ceiling for the remuneration of governments will only come into effect today, the full effects of the measure may only become visible over time, and we remain attentive to the spread between different money market rates as well as collateral scarcity concerns. The temporary change in the remuneration ceiling for government deposits gives government deposit holders extra time to undertake a smooth and gradual return of their deposits to the market. From the ECB's perspective, it remains the case that encouraging market intermediation of these deposits remains desirable in the long term. In the meantime, the temporary change will allow us to assess the adjustments of money markets across market segments to the return to positive interest rates and thereby also reduce uncertainty about the pass-through of the changes in the ECB interest rates to money markets.

3232,r220915a_ECB,euro area,2022-09-15,Euro area current policy challenges,guindos,0,"I am very pleased to be taking part in this event again and to be back to Lisbon in person. Following our monetary policy decisions last week, I would like to start with an overview of the euro area economic outlook that underpinned the Governing Council's deliberations. I will then share our assessment of the stability of the euro area financial system at the current juncture - the core focus of today's conference -and outline the ways in which recent economic developments are affecting financial stability in the euro area. After the rebound in the first half of 2022, the euro area is now facing a challenging outlook. The economy grew by 0.8% in the second quarter of the year on the back of strong consumer spending on services. Buoyant tourism has been supporting growth also during the third quarter, even as businesses struggle with high energy costs and continued supply bottlenecks. However, we expect output growth to slow down substantially. The robust consumer demand that came with the loosening of pandemic restrictions will lose steam in the coming months. Global demand is falling and euro area terms of trade have been worsening. Moreover, uncertainty remains high and confidence is falling sharply. Finally, the very high inflation is dampening spending and production, and these headwinds are reinforced by gas supply disruptions. As a result, the latest ECB staff projections for growth have been revised down markedly, with the euro area economy now set to expand by less than 1% next year. Russia's unjustified aggression towards Ukraine remains the key risk factor for the growth outlook. In a downside scenario reflecting a complete and long-lasting cut-off of Russian gas flows, ECB staff project a recession in 2023. The slowdown in economic activity is set against a deteriorating inflation outlook. Inflation rose further to 9.1% in August, marking the tenth consecutive month of record-high inflation rates. Energy prices are still the dominant driver of overall inflation. But price pressures have continued to strengthen and broaden, in part owing to the impact of high energy costs across more and more sectors. Even when excluding food and energy, almost half of the items in the inflation basket have recently recorded annual inflation rates above 4%. While supply bottlenecks have been easing, they continue to gradually feed through to consumer prices. The depreciation of the euro also adds to these inflationary pressures. These factors also explain the upward revisions to the staff projections for inflation. HICP inflation is projected to be unacceptably high this year and next. Even in 2024, the final year of the projection horizon, inflation is projected to stand at 2.3%, both for headline and core inflation, excluding the more volatile energy and food components. While most measures of longer-term inflation expectations currently stand at around 2%, they warrant continued monitoring for any signs of material above-target revisions. This is particularly important because the risks to the inflation outlook are primarily on the upside. In the downside scenario with a more severe energy crisis, headline inflation is projected to be even higher, reaching 6.9% next year and 2.7% in 2024. This outlook for growth and inflation leaves monetary policymakers with no easy choices. Some might ask why the ECB is normalising its interest rates in the face of an economic slowdown and high inflation that are largely driven by a cost-push shock. It is true that we are not in a classic demand-driven overheating episode, and that energy remains the dominant driver of rising inflation and slowing growth. But at the current low level of interest rates, monetary policy is still accommodative, thus supporting demand and ultimately also contributing to price pressures. With inflation at record-high levels, such an accommodative monetary policy stance is no longer appropriate. Moreover, we need to ensure that inflation expectations remain well anchored until the current shocks have passed so as to facilitate the return of inflation to our medium-term target. Against this background, we decided to raise interest rates by 0.75 percentage points at our Governing Council meeting last week. This major step frontloaded the transition from a highly accommodative level of policy rates towards levels that will ensure the return of inflation to our 2% medium-term target. We will regularly re-evaluate our policy path in light of incoming information and the evolving inflation outlook. Our future policy rate decisions will continue to be data-dependent and follow a meeting-by-meeting approach. Importantly, we need to guard against second-round effects such as the risk of a persistent upward shift in inflation expectations. At the same time, we are carefully monitoring the smooth transmission of our monetary policy stance throughout the euro area. The lasting vulnerabilities caused by the pandemic still pose a risk in this regard. Therefore, we also decided to continue applying flexibility in reinvesting redemptions coming due in the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) portfolio. Moreover, our new Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI) is available to counter unwarranted, disorderly market dynamics that pose a serious threat to the transmission of monetary policy across all euro area countries. Turning to the impact on the financial sector, overall financial stability conditions have deteriorated this year. Rising inflation and the worsened economic outlook in combination with tighter financing conditions are aggravating pre-existing vulnerabilities in both the non-financial and non-bank financial sectors - while in the banking sector profitability is, at least partly, supported by higher interest rates. Financial markets are vulnerable to changes in expectations about growth and inflation, as well as to changes in the monetary policy outlook. Tighter financial conditions have already resulted in a significant market correction in the first half of the year amid rising cross-asset correlations, notably between equity and bonds, two segments in which investors suffered the largest losses. Some market segments are still pricing in rapidly declining inflation and a mild growth slowdown, an assessment which could turn out to be too benign. In addition, investors do not expect the growth slowdown to significantly challenge corporate solvency or profitability. Over the next 12 months, corporate earnings are still expected to grow, while speculative-grade default rates are forecasted to pick up only slightly. But euro area corporates are facing continued headwinds from high input prices, higher borrowing costs and lower sales. Industrial producer price inflation in the euro area exceeded 40% in June. The resulting margin squeezes could limit firms' debt servicing capacity, particularly in the case of firms that are highly indebted and are still suffering from the repercussions of the pandemic. Moreover, high input costs affect production, especially for manufacturing firms, whose heavy reliance on natural gas makes them more vulnerable to high energy prices. Higher inflation is also squeezing households' disposable income. Families have to divert a larger fraction of their income towards everyday consumption, reducing their debt servicing capacity. As low-income households allocate a higher share of their income to food and energy, they are especially vulnerable to increases in these expenses. Vulnerabilities in euro area residential real estate markets are also rising in light of continued price increases and vigorous mortgage lending growth. In the first quarter of 2022 euro area residential real estate price growth stood at 9.8%, the highest nominal growth rate since the early 1990s. However, since the beginning of the year, household survey responses on the intention to buy a house have declined, and banks have lowered their expectations regarding mortgage loan demand, pointing to a greater potential for house price corrections. Turning to financial institutions, vulnerabilities in the non-bank financial sector have also increased this year. The risk that forced selling by investment funds could amplify a market correction remains high, amid low liquidity buffers. Duration risk has started to materialise and remains elevated, and further bond portfolio revaluation losses may arise in the context of rising yields. On a better note, systemic vulnerabilities in the banking sector are assessed as moderate. Bank profitability has improved owing partly to higher longer-term interest rates. This should, however, not overshadow rising fragilities related to the worsening macroeconomic outlook. Higher probabilities of default on corporate exposures and a related increase in provisioning, point to some early signs of higher bank credit risk due to high energy prices. While the situation is stable overall, with little sign of fragmentation in funding markets, bank funding costs have increased, with weaker banks remaining more vulnerable to further rises in their funding costs. Before concluding, let me recall the topic of transmission. As already mentioned, flexibility in redemptions coming due in the PEPP portfolio and TPI are important tools for addressing possible fragmentation from the monetary policy side. But monetary policy would be greatly facilitated if the banking union were complete. The lack of a common deposit insurance scheme remains an obstacle on our pathway towards a genuine Economic and Monetary Union. A period of heightened uncertainty is here to stay for a while, rendering decision-making more complex. Output growth is slowing down substantially and is expected to stagnate around year-end and remain low next year at less than 1%, while risks have intensified on the downside. This is set against a deteriorating inflation outlook with record-high inflation rates expected to stay elevated, well above our target, with risks primarily on the upside. In this challenging environment, monetary policy needs to walk a fine line to get it right. The same applies to the policy mix. Complementary actions of fiscal and monetary policy in their respective fields of responsibility were effective during the pandemic and continue to be of the essence in dealing with the current inflation shock. But the scope and nature of fiscal measures should be different now. Measures need to be focused, selective and targeted to the most vulnerable firms and households, who are hardest hit by the high inflation levels. Fiscal policy must be designed in a way that does not give rise to inflationary effects. Monetary policy needs to be focused on price stability and on delivering our inflation target over the medium term. Determined action is essential to keep inflation expectations anchored, which in itself contributes to delivering price stability and avoids second-round effects in inflation. The main asset that central banks have is credibility, and this asset becomes even more important in times of high uncertainty.

281,r220916a_BOA,australia,2022-09-16,        Opening Statement to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics,lowe,1,"Inflation is then expected to start declining, to be back around 3 per cent late in 2024. Global factors explain much of this increase in inflation. Russia's invasion of Ukraine resulted in major disruptions to energy markets, increasing retail energy prices around the world. And COVID-related interruptions to global production are still rippling through global supply chains, pushing prices up. The demand for goods in global markets has also been very strong over the past few years as people switched their spending from services to goods. The result of impaired supply and strong demand has been higher prices around the world. Important as these global factors have been, they are not the full story for why inflation is high in Australia. Demand here has been very strong relative to the ability of our economy to meet that demand. This is clearly evident in the labour market, where the number of job vacancies is at a record high and firms are finding it hard to hire workers. There are also capacity constraints in many sectors, including the building of infrastructure and the housing industry. This strong demand is, in part, a result of the policy approach during the pandemic. During 2020 and 2021, both fiscal and monetary policy provided very considerable economic support to households and businesses. At the RBA, we did this to provide a financial bridge to the day when the virus was contained and to provide some insurance against the possibility of very bad economic outcomes. As we sit here in Canberra today, it can be easy to forget how dire the outlook was in 2020: there were credible projections that the unemployment rate would reach 15 per cent, spending was collapsing, our hospitals were expected to be overflowing and a vaccine seemed years away. It was a scary time. In that environment, the Reserve Bank Board wanted to do what it could to help and to shore up confidence. We also were also seeking to provide some economic insurance against the worst possible outcomes. In the event, vaccines were developed in record time and our economy - with the support of monetary and fiscal policies - proved to be very resilient. We avoided the dire outcomes that many thought likely. And today, many people are returning back towards their pre-pandemic way of life and are spending again, including on travel and services. We saw further evidence of this last week in the National Accounts, with the Australian economy growing by 0.9 per cent in the June quarter, and by 3.6 per cent over the year. These are good outcomes, and they are better than those being recorded in most other countries. Given the resilience of our economy and the surge in inflation, it is understandable that some people are questioning whether or not too much support was provided by the RBA over the past two years. Judgements on this will differ. But in those dark days of the pandemic, the Reserve Bank Board judged that the bigger policy mistake would have been to do too little, rather than too much. If we had done too little and the worst had occurred, Australians could have paid a heavy price. As things turned out, thankfully, the worst was avoided. So it has been appropriate to unwind the very easy monetary conditions of the pandemic years and address the higher inflation that has emerged so quickly. This brings me to the third change since February - that is the increase in interest rates from the extraordinarily low levels during the pandemic. Since May, the cash rate has been increased by a cumulative 2 1/4 percentage points and now stands at 2.35 per cent. Like the rise in inflation, this increase has come sooner, and has been larger and faster, than was earlier expected. Previously the RBA had forecast that the damaging effects of the pandemic on our economy would be long lasting and that inflation would remain low. On that basis, we had expected that interest rates would remain low for some years. I am frequently reminded that many people interpreted our previous communication as a promise, or a commitment, that interest rates wouldn't rise until 2024. This was despite our statements on interest rates always being conditional on the state of the economy. This conditionality often got lost in the messaging. We are currently working through the implications of this for our future approach to forward guidance and communication more generally. Now that inflation is as high as it is, we need to make sure that inflation returns to target in reasonable time. A powerful lesson from history is that low and stable inflation is a prerequisite for a strong economy and a sustained period of full employment. High inflation damages our economy, worsens inequality and devalues people's savings. High inflation also makes it very difficult to sustain, or increase, real wages. It is a scourge. It is for these reasons that the RBA is committed to returning inflation to the 2 to 3 per cent target range over time. I know that higher interest rates are unwelcome for many people, especially those who have borrowed large sums over recent times. Higher interest rates are putting pressure on households, just at the time that higher petrol prices and grocery bills are squeezing budgets. So it is a difficult and a concerning time for some people. The alternative, though, of allowing higher inflation to become entrenched would be even more difficult and it would damage our economic prospects. The RBA will do what is necessary to make sure that higher inflation does not become entrenched and we are committed to returning inflation to the 2 to 3 per cent target range. We are seeking to do this in a way that keeps the economy on an even keel. It is possible to achieve this, but the path here is a narrow one and it is clouded in uncertainty. One important source of uncertainty is the global economy, where the outlook has deteriorated. The situation in Europe is very troubling, not least because of the extraordinary increases in energy prices. And in the United States, the Federal Reserve has indicated that monetary policy will need to become restrictive to lower inflation. The Chinese economy is also facing major challenges due to the combination of COVID, a severe drought and very weak conditions in the property sector. It will be difficult for Australia to stay on that narrow path to a soft landing if there is further material bad news on the global economy. Another factor that will determine how successfully we navigate that narrow path is how inflation expectations and the general inflation psychology evolve in Australia. To date, medium-term inflation expectations have remained well anchored, which is good news. But the general inflation psychology appears to be shifting; it is easier for firms to put their prices up and the public is more accepting of this. Wages growth has also picked from the very low rates of recent years and a further increase is expected due to the very tight labour market. Stronger wages growth is something that the RBA had been seeking for a number of years and some pick-up is welcome. It is also important to note that, to date, the stronger growth in wages has not been a major factor driving inflation higher and, at the aggregate level, growth in labour costs remains consistent with inflation returning to target. Looking forward now, it is important that we avoid a cycle where higher inflation leads to higher wages and inflation remaining high. This type of cycle would lead to higher interest rates, a weaker economy, and higher unemployment. Businesses, too, have a role in avoiding these damaging outcomes, by not using the higher inflation as cover for an increase in profit margins. A third issue we are watching carefully is household spending. Consumer sentiment has fallen, household disposable income is under pressure from higher interest rates and higher inflation, and housing prices are declining after large gains. On the other hand, many households are benefiting from the strong labour market, including by finding jobs and getting more hours of work. Some households are also continuing to save at a higher rate than before the pandemic. Quite a few have also built up large financial buffers, although many other households have only very limited buffers. In the face of these competing factors, the recent data suggest that spending has remained resilient so far. There is, though, considerable uncertainty as to how these factors will balance out over the months ahead and we are watching the situation carefully. In terms of the outlook for interest rates, the Reserve Bank Board expects that further increases will be required to bring inflation back to target. We are not on a pre-set path, though, especially given the uncertainties I have just spoken about. The increase in interest rates has been rapid and global and we know monetary policy operates with a lag. At some point, it will be appropriate to slow the rate of increase in interest rates and the case for doing that becomes stronger as the level of interest rates increases. As I have said previously, the size and timing of future interest rate increases will be guided by the incoming data and the Board's assessment of the outlook for inflation and the labour market. On a different matter, as you would know, the Government has commissioned a review into Australia's monetary policy arrangements and the RBA. Both the Board and the Bank's staff welcome this review and we have already had constructive discussions with the Review Panel. We look forward to discussing with this Committee the topics raised by the Review at this and future hearings. To complement the external review, the RBA is undertaking internal reviews into the three-year yield target, the bond purchase program and our approach to forward guidance. The yield target review was published in June and the review of the bond purchase program will be published next week. The forward guidance review will be published later this year. Finally, since this is the first hearing of this Committee under the 47th Parliament, I would like to draw your attention to some of the RBA's other responsibilities. We are the banker to the Commonwealth Government. We operate the Official Public Account and are the Government's main transactional banker, providing banking services to the ATO, Services Australia and many government departments. Over the past couple of years we played an important role in making the COVIDrelated and flood disaster payments in real time. We made sure that people received their money quickly, often on weekends and outside of business hours. We are also responsible for the core of Australia's payment system, which allows money to move from one bank to another. As part of this work, we operate the centre of Australia's real-time fast payments system, which makes it possible for money to move between bank accounts in a matter of seconds at any time of the day or week. We also print the nation's banknotes. While cash is being used less and less frequently for transactions, there is still strong demand for our banknotes. On average, there are 18 $100 notes and 38 $50 notes on issue for every person in Australia. The total value of notes on issue is $102 billion, which averages around $4,000 per person. That is a high number. The RBA has important regulatory responsibilities in the payments system, which are overseen by the Payments System Board. We supervise the central counterparties that are operated by the ASX and that are at the heart of Australia's financial market infrastructure. We also have regulatory responsibilities for efficiency, competition and stability in Australia's retail payments system. One issue that we are currently examining closely is the public interest case for the RBA to issue a digital form of the Australian dollar, which could complement the physical banknotes that we currently issue. We have an open mind as to whether it will be in the public interest to do this. We are currently working with the Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre on potential use cases and also working with other central banks on this important issue. Thank you. My colleagues and I are here to answer your questions.","['inflation', 'demand', 'economy', 'economic', 'fiscal']","['australia demand', 'australian economy', 'australia monetary', 'increase inflation', 'inflation leads']","['inflation high australia', 'high australia demand', 'australia monetary policy', 'australia demand strong', 'australian economy growing']","['australian economy', 'high inflation', 'higher inflation', 'inflation', 'lower inflation']"

3234,r220920a_ECB,euro area,2022-09-20,Monetary policy in the euro area,lagarde,1,"I am honoured to deliver the Karl Otto Pohl lecture this evening on the topic of monetary policy in the euro area. After a long period when inflation in the euro area was too low, it is now far too high. We are in the tenth consecutive month of record-high inflation rates and we may see this streak continue in the near term. Inflation is being caused by a series of unprecedented shocks, which have led to turning points in the global economy. As a result, price pressures have proven much stronger and more persistent than originally projected. In this setting, monetary policymakers must ensure that inflation does not become entrenched and that it returns to target in the medium term. And our policy response will need to account for the special combination of shocks that we are facing in the euro area. In my remarks this evening, I would like to address two issues. First, the nature of the inflation shock we are facing in the euro area today, and second, the implications this has for monetary policy now and in the future. In our monetary policy strategy, the appropriate response to a deviation of inflation from our target depends on three factors: the source, size and persistence of that deviation. Typically, when the source of an inflationary shock is stemming mainly from demand, monetary policy will respond proactively to prevent the economy from overheating. And when faced with supply shocks, to the extent that such shocks are seen to have no lasting impact on inflation, central banks will ""look through"" and extend the medium-term policy horizon if necessary. But such a neat categorisation does not adequately capture the situation we are facing in the euro area today. We are not seeing the type of demand-led overheating that is visible in the United States and, despite a tight labour market, the risk of a wage-price spiral so far seems to remain contained. Instead, the euro area is seeing an increase in inflation driven by two unprecedented shocks. These shocks have constrained global supply, but they have also shifted demand and led to a large and persistent inflation response. The first shock was the pandemic. Pandemic-related supply bottlenecks and rising prices have reinforced each other, with firms reacting to the threat of shortages by ordering more and earlier. This ""bullwhip effect"" has driven up prices along the pricing chain. At the same time, the fiscal and monetary policy response to the pandemic has succeeded in protecting nominal incomes, thereby supporting a fast recovery of demand when our economies reopened. The resilience of incomes has, in turn, triggered large swings in demand across sectors. During the lockdown period, and thanks notably to e-commerce, consumption was concentrated on durable goods. Then, when the economy reopened, we saw strong pent-up demand for services. Since the start of the pandemic, the volatility of durable goods consumption has been almost ten times higher than during the preceding two decades, and almost 30 times higher for services. This has led to inflation broadening into both industrial goods and services. Today, around three-quarters of the items in the core inflation basket have inflation rates above 2%. The second shock has been Russia's unjustifiable invasion of Ukraine. Even before the invasion, OPEC+ production cuts and capital constraints on US shale producers were restricting energy supply. This resulted in a spike in energy prices which was a major factor in our underestimation of inflation . But the invasion has hugely aggravated the supply squeeze and sent energy prices to extraordinary levels, making it all the more challenging to forecast inflation. European gas and electricity prices are up 105% and 75%, respectively, since the months before the invasion , and around 650% and 450%, respectively, since the first half of 2021. This surge in energy prices has directly contributed around 30% to the headline inflation rate since the start of this year and, indirectly, has added to the broadening of price pressures across the economy. In fact, the models used by the national central banks indicate that the indirect effects of higher energy costs are currently contributing around one-third to core inflation. Collectively, these shocks have pushed inflation a long way from our target. Headline inflation - which was negative as recently as December 2020 - has risen by 9.4 percentage points from its trough during the pandemic to its peak last month. Core inflation has risen by 4.1 percentage points. In the recent past, elastic global supply has meant that shocks to production or energy have dissipated eventually. Following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in the 1990s, for example, oil prices fell below their pre-war level after around five months. And following the Japanese earthquake and nuclear disaster in 2011, production is estimated to have returned to normal after only seven months for Japanese firms. But the shocks triggered by the pandemic and the war have also created what I have previously called a ""new global map"" of economic relationships. The economic turning points on this new global map imply that supply constraints are likely to last longer than in the past. And this means, in turn, that it is taking longer for the inflationary effects of those shocks to fade out. Two issues are worth considering here. First, geopolitics have shaken up European energy markets. The cut in gas supplies owing to the Russian invasion has become a major structural change which will have ramifications for several years. For example, following the two oil shocks of the 1970s - the OPEC embargo and the Iranian revolution - the effect on oil prices was still persistent after three years. This was because, in both cases, the shocks were related to a lasting shift in the geopolitical landscape, and reductions in oil supply could not be fully offset by oil from other sources. Today, although the EU response will cushion the rise in energy costs, fossil fuel prices are likely to be higher for some time. Fully replacing European imports of Russian fossil fuels is a challenge in the short term, even though there are an increasing number of examples of substitution effects taking place. Over the longer term, the war is likely to accelerate the green transition in Europe, including the switch to renewables. This will require considerable green investment but will also weigh on investment in oil and gas production during the transition phase. That could put upward pressure on fossil fuel prices while demand for those fuels remains high. If energy prices are durably higher during the transition, it may have an impact on industrial production in Europe, affecting both supply and prices. This is certainly how firms in the euro area see the situation. In a recent ECB survey, at least 80% of respondents expected the ongoing transition to make the raw materials and energy they use more expensive, leading to higher prices for their products. Second, globalisation is and will be changing. The disruptions created by the pandemic, the exposure of vulnerabilities, the new geopolitical landscape and the prospect of higher energy and transport costs look set to trigger a reassessment of global value chains. While I doubt that we will see de-globalisation, firms are likely to hold higher inventories on a permanent basis and shorten their supply chains to relocate high-value services and R&D centres. This is especially true where strategic considerations come into play. We might also see energy-intensive production being relocated owing to the uneven impact of the current energy price shock. Added to this, the speed of the transition and the new energy mix will contribute to material transformations. A recent survey finds that around 60% of firms had increased their inventories of critical products by the end of 2021, and almost 90% were expecting to regionalise their production over the next three years. This is likely to reduce efficiency and increase costs, which could create inflation pressures while supply chains are adjusting. It could also make the economic cycle more volatile. Over time, however, the turning points I have identified could also dampen the impact on prices. The green transition, for example, should ultimately lead to falling electricity prices. And insofar as the inventory cycle returns, it will be a multiplier for lower prices when inventories are liquidated in a downturn. So, to sum up, we are currently facing a situation where lingering supply constraints are an important factor causing above-target inflation to persist for longer - and their effect is being exacerbated by the release of pent-up demand. In this setting, monetary policy needs to avoid deviations from our target becoming entrenched and return inflation to 2% in the medium term. Two considerations are important here. The first is the destination of monetary policy: we need to normalise policy, and be ready to adjust rates by as much as necessary to reach our inflation target in the medium term. The second consideration is the pace of rate increases: since interest rates are rising from very low levels, the pace of rate increases can mobilise the signalling channel of monetary policy directly. Let me address each of these points in turn. First, when inflation is high and growth is constrained by inelastic supply, monetary policy cannot remain expansionary and add to inflationary pressures by pushing up demand. It is therefore appropriate to pursue a strategy of monetary policy normalisation. As I explained in a blog post earlier this year, normalisation implies ending net asset purchases and then raising rates to neutral levels - so levels that are neither expansionary nor restrictive. That is why the ECB has not only started raising interest rates, but also communicated that we expect to raise interest rates further over the next several meetings. And to ensure that these changes in our policy stance are effective, we have taken several decisions over the last few months to preserve the orderly transmission of our stance throughout the euro area. As we move forward, we will reassess whether a normalisation strategy is sufficient to bring us back to 2% inflation over the medium term. Ultimately, the terminal rate at which our hiking cycle ends must be compatible with inflation returning durably to our target - and that rate will depend on how the economic environment evolves around us. One key factor will be how the persistence of the shocks we are facing affects inflation expectations and potential output. If there were evidence that high inflation risked de-anchoring inflation expectations, then the policy rate that is compatible with our target would lie in restrictive territory. Similarly, were we to conclude that ongoing supply shocks had durably lowered economic potential, we would have to ensure that demand remains aligned with supply. Another key factor will be how the growth outlook affects inflation. Negative supply shocks will result in a growth slowdown, which will likely have an impact on the prevailing inflation rate. In past euro area recessions going back to the 1970s, headline inflation has fallen by about 1.1 percentage points a year later, while core inflation has fallen by about half that amount. But this is not a hard-and-fast rule: in some recessionary episodes, such as those triggered by a worsening of supply conditions, inflation has stayed the same or even risen. In our downside scenario, which captures - among other shocks - the impact of a complete cut-off of Russian gas, we project that the economy will contract next year before picking up in 2024. But inflation is expected to be higher at the end of the projection horizon than in the baseline scenario. A third factor will be the actions of governments. Monetary policy will do whatever is needed to return inflation to our target. But a truly European approach where monetary and fiscal policy complement each other can improve the inflation outlook. In particular, how fiscal policies support firms and households through the difficult winter ahead will play an important role in inflation dynamics. Targeted, temporary and tailored measures are needed to protect the incomes of the most vulnerable, while also preventing a significant loss of capacity owing to production cuts and bankruptcies. But beyond that, it will make a difference whether fiscal policy focuses mainly on public consumption and transfers - which may add to inflationary pressures - or on public investment and debt sustainability. As many of the sources of inflation today are on the supply side, government policies that lift supply and redirect investment to where it is needed are necessary to support sustainable growth. The second consideration in responding to current inflation is the pace of rate increases. When inflation is high for a long period of time, an important role for monetary policy is to ensure that inflation expectations remain anchored as the shocks work their way through the economy. If expectations become de-anchored and trigger a wage-price spiral, it can lead to inflation becoming persistent even after the shocks disappear. Raising interest rates has a mechanical effect on demand and inflation, and thereby on inflation expectations. But when interest rates are starting from unusually low levels, rate hikes are more powerful if they also create signalling effects that influence expectations directly. In this context, especially compared with the traditional focus on 25 basis-point increments, adjusting the pace of rate hikes is a key tool to signal our determination to fulfil our mandate and keep inflation expectations contained. And moving faster at the start of the hiking cycle clearly conveys our commitment to bring down inflation to our medium-term target. At present, inflation expectations remain relatively well anchored across a range of measures. But there are two reasons why it would be unwise to take this for granted. First, the shock is severely affecting the prices of those consumption items, such as groceries and petrol, that have the greatest influence on households' inflation expectations. The ECB's Consumer Expectations Survey shows that, since February this year, both mean and median expectations for inflation three years ahead have risen by around 1 percentage point. Second, we are seeing a rapid change in the economic environment, with inflation switching from being very low to being extremely high. History suggests this can leave a scar on expectations. For example, research finds that differences in inflation expectations between people from the former East and West Germany can largely be explained by the lasting effect of the inflation shock after reunification. This contrasted strongly with the perceived norm of zero inflation in the German Democratic Republic and seems to have led former East Germans to over-adjust to an environment of rising prices. This imperative to anchor inflation expectations helps explain why, over the last two policy meetings of the ECB's Governing Council, we raised our key interest rates by 125 basis points in total. This is the fastest change in rates in our history and it has sent a strong signal of our determination to return inflation to our medium-term target in a timely manner. This major step also took into account the unusually low level of interest rates and the limited risk of overreacting at the start of the hiking cycle. Going forward, the appropriate pace of future rate increases will be decided on a meeting-by-meeting basis. Indeed, as we have repeatedly emphasised, we will remain data dependent in all scenarios. Where rates ultimately settle, and the size of the steps that we move in, will depend on how the inflation outlook evolves as we proceed. Let me conclude. Inflation in the euro area has proven to be much higher and more persistent than originally projected. This reflects the unprecedented series of shocks we have faced, and the fact that those shocks have led to turning points in our economic environment. Monetary policy cannot prevent the first-round effects of many of these shocks. But it can ensure that they do not become embedded. This is what the ECB is doing. We have taken major steps along the path of normalising our monetary policy, frontloading our rate increases. This signals that we are determined to bring inflation back to our medium-term target of 2% in a timely manner and ensure that inflation expectations remain well anchored. We will not let this phase of high inflation feed into economic behaviour and create a lasting inflation problem. Our monetary policy will be set with one goal in mind: to deliver on our price stability mandate.","['inflationary', 'inflation', 'euro', 'shocks', 'recessionary']","['inflationary shock', 'inflation shock', 'inflation euro', 'inflation european', 'inflation response']","['shocks facing euro', 'inflation shock facing', 'inflation response shock', 'inflation persistent shocks', 'effect inflation shock']","['inflationary shock', 'inflation shock', 'persistent inflation response', 'target inflation', 'inflationary pressures']"

Trends in the life insurance sector and the need for strong reinsurance and investment risk management,gerken,0,"Use of internal credit assessments for assigning fundamental spreads Assessing the risks from equity release mortgages Risk identification and modelling of Income Producing Real Estate loans 1.1 This supervisory statement (SS) sets out the PRA's expectations in respect of firms investing in illiquid, unrated assets within their Solvency II matching adjustment (MA) portfolios. It is relevant to life insurance and reinsurance companies holding or intending to hold unrated assets (including restructured equity portfolio. 1.2 This statement should be read in conjunction with Chapters 6 and 7 of the Technical 1.3 As part of firms' MA applications, they are required to explain how they will group the assets in the MA portfolio credit quality step (CQS), asset class and duration for the purposes of determining the fundamental spread (FS). For assets with credit ratings provided by External prescriptive, with the only judgement being over the categorisation by asset class. In contrast, for internally-rated assets there is more judgement involved in determining which CQS and hence which FS should apply. 1.4 Firms need to have confidence that the risk management of these more complex credit exposures, in particular the CQS mapping process and the size of the MA benefit claimed on them, is fit for purpose. It is therefore expected that firms will be able to provide strong evidence to support the CQS mapping for those internally-rated assets that present the greatest complexity and/or risk exposure. Chief Actuary is responsible for advising the board about the reliability and adequacy of the calculation of the technical provisions; Chief Risk Officer is responsible for reporting to the board on the risk management strategies and processes in relation to credit assessments; and Head of Internal Audit is responsible for independent assurance on the adequacy and effectiveness of these processes and the firm's accounting and reporting procedures. 1.6 Where material reliance is being placed on the CQS mapping for internally-rated assets, the Chief Actuary and Chief Risk Officer will need to be satisfied that an appropriate FS is being applied and the Internal Audit function will need to be satisfied that appropriate processes and procedures have been followed. Chapter 2 of this SS clarifies the PRA's expectations where internal credit assessments are used as part of determining the FS, including some expectations that are specific to restructured assets (including ERMs). Chapter 3 then sets out some principles to be applied when assessing the risks from guarantees embedded within ERMs, for the purposes of verifying the appropriateness of the FS for restructured ERM notes. Chapter 4 sets out the PRA's expectations regarding the risk identification exercise and the risk calibration and validation of internal models for illiquid assets. 2.1 Firms are reminded that performing an internal credit assessment and mapping an asset onto a CQS are two distinct processes. Generally, a CQS mapping for an exposure should reflect all of the sources of credit risk relevant to that exposure. This is particularly important when the CQS is used for the purposes of deriving an FS, because the FS should reflect the risks 2.2 As part of the initial MA approval process, the PRA requires firms to obtain proportionate independent assurance reviews of the internal credit assessment processes used for assets within the MA portfolio. These reviews generally focus on providing assurance on the processes themselves based on the opinion of the reviewer, as opposed to the outcome CQS and FS that firms assign to their assets as a result of those processes. 2.3 The overarching aim of the FS is to determine how much of the spread on an eligible asset should be taken to reflect the risks retained by the firm on the assumption that the asset is held until maturity. To serve as a useful starting point for that calculation, an internal credit assessment should consider all possible sources of credit risk, both qualitative (eg due to strength of the terms and conditions in the loan agreement or a lack of default data) and quantitative (eg due to economic stresses), and how these may interact. An internal credit assessment will then need to be mapped onto a CQS. The PRA's view is that the CQS to which an internal credit assessment maps lie within the plausible range of CQSs that could have resulted from an issue rating given by an ECAI. Broad consistency between the CQSs resulting from firms' internal assessments and ECAI issue ratings will help to give the PRA assurance that the FS resulting from the assigned CQS and sector is appropriate. 2.4A The PRA notes that the mapping of ECAI credit ratings to CQS for the purposes of 2016/1800 (the ITSs). The PRA will consider the ITSs in assessing whether a firm's mapping of its internal rating to CQS is within the plausible CQS range that could have resulted from an issue rating given by an ECAI. The PRA's expectations for internal credit assessments are 2.5 Once a CQS and asset class has been assigned, firms are required by Article 77e(3) of the Solvency II Directive to use the corresponding FS set out in the technical information published alter the CQS mapping of an asset on the grounds that they disagree with the technical information adopted in the relevant ITS, eg if a firm's opinion on the appropriate recovery rate for that asset differs from that specified in Article 54(2) of the Delegated Regulation. 2.6 To determine whether these expectations are being met, the PRA will seek assurance on firms' CQS mappings in a proportionate way, focusing on the exposures which in its view present the greatest risk and potential for inappropriately large MA benefit. In assessing the risk of an exposure to a particular asset class, the PRA will consider both the proportion and the absolute amount of the spread that is being claimed as MA benefit, as well as the materiality of the exposure. Specifically the PRA will focus on assets which present some or all of the following features: they are more complex (eg because they have been restructured); the absolute amount of MA benefit derived from the asset is material to the firm; or the MA benefit (expressed as a proportion of the total spread on the asset) is high either in its own right or when compared to the benefit from a comparable reference instrument. 2.7 The PRA will calibrate thresholds around these features using data on firms' asset exposures. For assets that exceed these thresholds, the PRA will seek additional assurance that the FS resulting from the assigned CQS and sector are appropriate, taking into account the specific risks posed by the assets. 2.8A In order for a firm to evidence the robustness of its internal credit assessments, and hence provide assurance in respect of the assigned CQS and FS, the PRA expects the following areas to be implemented and documented. This is not an exhaustive list. 2.8B There should be an identification of all the risks affecting each asset and an assessment of how the firm has satisfied itself that it has considered all potential sources of systemic and idiosyncratic risk in its internal credit assessment. This should include consideration of the following factors at a minimum: external market factors; cash-flow predictability; collateral; loan characteristics (eg refinancing risk); risks arising from third-parties (eg sponsors, parties involved in the servicing and managing of the loan); legal, political and regulatory risks; and potential future risks eg impacts arising from climate change risks. 2.8C In addition, where a firm uses an internal model, the PRA expects the same underlying risk identification exercise to be used as a starting consideration for both the internal model and internal credit assessment process. However, a firm may justify why only a subset of the identified risks is then selected for inclusion in the internal model or credit assessment. This subset of risks may differ between the internal model and credit assessment. 2.8D The PRA expects firms' internal credit assessment methodology and criteria to: set out the overall credit assessment philosophy and the ratings process; set out the scope of types of loans or entities the methodology applies to; set out the scope of risks covered and define the credit and other relevant risks being measured; where an ECAI has a published credit rating methodology for an asset class, have in scope at least the same range of risks, qualitative and quantitative factors and risk mitigating considerations or justify any difference in the scope; describe how different loan features, risks and other factors relevant are assessed; set out the key assumptions and judgements underlying the assessment, including the treatment of assumed risk mitigating actions which rely on the firm's own or outsourced processes involved in managing assets through their lifecycles; define whether the credit assessment is calibrated to a point-in-time or through-the-cycle; use both qualitative and quantitative factors; and, explain the limitations of the internal credit assessment, for example, risks which are not covered, and when it would not be appropriate to allow for these limitations by overriding judgements. 2.8E The PRA expects a firm to justify its internal credit assessment methodology and to recognise any limitations. 2.8F Where a firm has decided that its internal credit assessment methodology for a particular asset class should be based on an ECAI's published credit rating methodology that is applicable for that asset class, the PRA also expects the firm to apply that methodology in full in the manner applied by the ECAI. 2.8G Regardless of the choice of a firm's internal credit assessment methodology, firms should also describe how they have maintained broad consistency between the CQSs resulting from their internal assessments and those which could have resulted from an issue rating given by an ECAI. The PRA expects firms to consider the availability, appropriateness, and quality of the data over the credit cycle on which their internal risk assessments and calibrations are based, and should clearly document how they have allowed for incomplete or missing data in the internal credit assessment. This includes consideration of whether the data is sufficient to support the proposed CQS mapping. The PRA expects expert judgements made in the determination of the internal credit assessment and CQS mappings to be transparent, justified and documented, and consideration given to the circumstances in which judgements on the rating would be considered false. Furthermore, the history of judgements applied to deviate from the result of the internal credit rating methodology should be well documented, as should any other end of process overriding adjustments to the internal credit ratings themselves. The key judgements should be subject to the appropriate level of governance within the overall credit assessment process. 2.8J The PRA expects to see evidence that the credit rating methodology and criteria development and approval, credit assessment and CQS mapping have been performed by individuals with relevant asset-specific credit risk expertise and competency, who are independent and with minimised conflicts of interest, be they internal or external to the firm. In particular, firms should demonstrate the independence of the internal credit assessment function and that effective controls are in place to manage any potential conflicts of interest between different stakeholders involved in the overall management of the assets. 2.8K The PRA expects firms to undertake validation of the internal credit assessment methodology and criteria including how it has identified and allowed for all sources of credit risk, whether qualitatively or quantitatively. In addition, the PRA expects the firm's validation to ensure that the internal credit assessment has satisfied the points in paragraph 2.4. 2.8L The PRA expects firms to have a robust process for the ongoing review of the credit assessments (and CQS mapping), including how the firm has satisfied itself that these will remain appropriate over the lifetime of the assets and operate robustly under a range of different market conditions and operating experience. The credit assessment and CQS mapping should be reviewed at regular intervals, as well as in response to changes in relevant external market conditions or other factors which are expected to impact the rating. In addition to this firms should monitor how the internal credit assessment criteria is applied consistently both within and across asset categories. 2.8M The PRA expects firms to identify potential refinements needed to their methodology by monitoring their own credit experience against the internal credit rating assessments and changes made by ECAIs to their methodology and criteria. This should include addressing any previously identified shortcomings in the firm's internal credit assessment process (including any that were identified as part of the independent reviews mentioned in paragraph 2.2 2.8N Where some or all of the internal credit assessment process is outsourced, the PRA expects firms to also demonstrate the effectiveness of the systems and processes the outsourcer has in place, including validation, to ensure that outsourced internal credit assessments for assets satisfy the expectations set out in 2.8A to 2.8M and that the evidence that appropriate oversight systems and processes including governance are in place and have been carried out effectively for outsourced credit assessments. 2.9 If the PRA judges that a firm is unable to provide satisfactory assurance using its own internal resources, it may choose to commission an independent review, which may take the form of a report commissioned from a skilled person under Section 166 of the Financial 2.10 The PRA expects that internal credit assessments for restructured assets will be anchored on a risk analysis of the legal documentation between all parties concerned. In the case of restructured ERMs, this includes, for example, the original loan agreement between the borrower and the lender, the contract between the originator and the insurance firm, and the legal structure of the notes issued by the special purpose vehicle (SPV). 2.11 As mentioned in paragraph 2.3, firms should consider both qualitative and quantitative sources of risk in their credit risk assessments. The PRA expects that all of the risks to which the senior notes are exposed (including combinations of risks) will be considered in the internal credit assessment, the assigned CQS and therefore the FS derived. 2.12 In respect of ERMs some of the quantitative features the PRA would expect to be considered explicitly include (but are not limited to): underwriting terms of the underlying ERMs (eg prepayment terms, interest rate at which the loan will accrue, conditions attaching to the borrowers, conditions attaching to the exposures (eg loan to value ratios, ages of borrowers, health of borrowers); strength of security (eg location, state and concentration of the properties used as collateral, rights of the SPV to substitute underlying ERMs); leverage, including a full analysis of the cash flow waterfall between the loan receivables and the cash flows paid to the senior noteholder; and stress and scenario testing of the amount and timing of receivables, for instance as a result of: changes in the value of the properties that collateralise the ERMs, both in the immediate and longer term, including allowance for additional costs (eg dilapidation costs, transaction costs relating to sales); demographic risks relating to the borrowers under the ERMs (eg longevity trend and volatility, morbidity); and prepayment risk. 2.13 Where these exposures involve a large number of homogeneous retail exposures, as would be expected in the case of most ERM securitisations, statistical approaches could be an acceptable proportionate method for assessing exposures and risks. However we note this is unlikely to be acceptable for wholesale exposures (corporate lending and specialised lending) which tend to be large and heterogeneous. 2.14 Where a firm has restructured an asset, eg an ERM portfolio, into a range of tranches, the spread on a given tranche should be commensurate with the level of risk to which that tranche is exposed. The more junior the tranche, the greater the spread would be expected to be in order to reflect the higher exposure to risk. 2.15 Likewise the PRA would expect to see evidence that the securitisation structure provides loss absorbency to protect the senior note payments, eg a proportion of the cash flows accruing to the junior note in the early years of the transaction being kept in reserve in case of subsequent losses that reach the senior notes. 2.16 Reliance on any credit-enhancing or liquidity-enhancing features should be carefully justified, taking into account the availability of these facilities over the expected lifetime of the SPV, including under stressed scenarios such as those referred to in paragraph 2.12. 2.17 Qualitative factors that a firm may need to reflect in the internal credit assessment could uncertainty over the quantitative risk factors above resulting from a lack of data; the terms and conditions of the legal agreement(s) between the insurer and the SPV (eg cross-default provisions, covenants); uncertainty about the recoverability of the receivables when they become due (eg due to legal rights or practical considerations); and quality of loan servicing (eg ability to monitor properties and maintain knowledge of exposure and risk). 3.1 This chapter sets out the PRA's approach to assessing the risks to which insurers that invest in ERMs are, directly or indirectly, exposed. The assessment covers the appropriateness of the amount of MA benefit arising from restructured ERM notes. 3.1A The size of the MA benefit arising from restructured ERM notes depends on the: contractually-agreed cash flows of the notes and the value placed on those notes, which will determine their spread; and FS assigned to the notes. The FS must reflect the risks that the firm retains in relation to the cash flows of the notes, including default and downgrade risk. These, in turn, will be driven by the risks presented by the underlying assets. 3.2 ERMs are complex assets that often have embedded features such as a 'no negative equity guarantee' (NNEG) and no fixed maturity date. Restructuring them to produce MA-eligible notes with fixed cash flows adds a further layer of complexity. And there are typically no ECAI ratings or observable market prices for restructured notes on which firms and the PRA could place reliance. 3.3 As with any securitisation, there is a risk that the valuation and/or credit assessment of the MA-eligible notes is not aligned with their true risk profile, leading to a spread that is too high or an FS that does not reflect all of the risks retained by the firm. As noted in paragraph 2.6, the PRA will apply a higher supervisory intensity where it considers that there is a risk that the FS on internally-rated assets may be inappropriate. For restructured ERM notes, this increased oversight will include both an assessment of the quality of the firm's internal credit assessments (see paragraphs 2.10 to 2.17), and a verification that the risks retained by the firm as a result of the embedded NNEGs have been appropriately allowed for, as described below. 3.3A Where firms hold all of the tranches of a securitisation, the economic substance of their aggregate exposure remains the same regardless of the form of the securitisation. Understanding the risks posed to a firm by holding ERMs, in particular the NNEG, and how these risks have been distributed between the various tranches of restructured notes (for example in the FS of MA eligible notes and the spread or valuation of the junior and senior notes), is an important part of ensuring that the MA does not arise from risks retained by the firm. (the 'EVT') (below) is not the only method that could be used for these purposes but it is consistent with principles (ii) to (iv) in paragraph 3.8 and firms using this approach to demonstrate that they are not taking inappropriately large MA benefit from restructured ERM cash flows will meet the PRA's expectations for this assessment. Any alternative approaches that calculate property forward prices assuming property growth in excess of the risk-free rate while simultaneously discounting at the risk-free rate, without also making a sufficient allowance for the risk in the assumed property growth (as envisaged by principle (iv) in paragraph 3.8), are equivalent to assuming a negative deferment rate and would not meet 3.4 The NNEG guarantees that the amount repayable by the borrower under the ERM need never exceed the market value of the property collateralising the loan at the repayment date. As such it is an important source of risk for an ERM. As part of the review of the amount of MA benefit being claimed by a firm, the PRA will assess the extent to which the contractual terms, value and rating of restructured notes properly reflect the underlying NNEG risks and the extent to which these underlying risks flow through to the notes held within the firm's MA portfolio (and as such are effectively retained by the firm for these purposes). for these NNEG risks should not lead to an MA benefit. For example, assuming future house price growth in excess of risk-free rates should not lead to a lower valuation of the NNEG and hence higher MA, because firms are fully exposed to the risk that the excess house price growth will not be achieved. 3.5 Assets such as ERMs generally do not have directly observable market prices, and so nor do they have directly observable spreads. Instead a spread must be derived, having first determined both a fair value for the ERM using alternative valuation methods as well as assumptions about cash flows. 3.6 The presence of an NNEG will increase the derived spread on an ERM versus an equivalent loan without such a guarantee. It will also increase the amount of spread that should properly be attributed to risks retained by the firm. 3.7 When determining the fair value of an asset for the purposes of deriving its spread, it is important that any embedded guarantees are valued consistently with the rest of the asset (ie on fair value principles). Otherwise, the component of the asset's spread that is assumed to represent compensation for the risks arising from the guarantee may be underestimated. Further, it is not sufficient simply to ensure that the value placed on the asset as a whole represents a fair value, since there could still be an incorrect attribution of value between the NNEG and the other components driving the valuation. 3.8 The PRA will assess the allowance made for the NNEG risk against its view of the underlying risks retained by the firm. This assessment will include the following four principles, which are explained in more detail below: securitisations where firms hold all tranches do not result in a reduction of risk to the firm; the economic value of ERM cash flows cannot be greater than either the value of an equivalent loan without an NNEG or the present value of deferred possession of the property providing collateral; the present value of deferred possession of property should be less than the value of immediate possession; and the compensation for the risks retained by a firm as a result of the NNEG must comprise more than the best estimate cost of the NNEG. 3.10 Where firms hold all of the tranches of a securitisation (as is generally the case for correctly restructured ERM portfolios), the economic substance of their aggregate exposure remains the same regardless of the form of the securitisation. Understanding the risks posed to a firm by the NNEG, and how these risks have been distributed between the various tranches of restructured notes, is an important part of ensuring that the FS appropriately reflects all of the NNEG risks that are retained by the firm in relation to the cash flows on the MA-eligible notes. 3.11 Some of the exposure to the risks posed by the NNEG will remain in the junior tranches outside of the MA portfolio. Nevertheless it is important to verify that the combination of the junior tranche values and the FS of the MA-eligible tranche(s) have appropriately covered all of the risks retained by a firm that holds the ERMs until maturity, including those that arise from the NNEG. For this reason the PRA will assess the overall 'Effective Value' of the restructured ERM against the components of the value of the un-restructured ERM (the 'economic value decomposition'), as described below and illustrated in Figure 1 below. 3.12 The 'Effective Value' of restructured ERMs is the total value of all tranches of the restructured ERMs on the asset side of the balance sheet, plus the MA benefit arising from the restructured ERMs on the liability side of the balance sheet. The right-hand side of Figure 1 illustrates the construction of Effective Value, alongside an illustration of one way in which the value of un-restructured ERMs can be made up. The total value of the securitisation tranches is illustrated as being somewhat lower than the value of the un-restructured ERMs, to reflect the frictional costs of restructuring, on the assumption that an equation of value holds. 3.13 On the left-hand side of Figure 1, the value of un-restructured ERMs has been illustratively decomposed into: the value of expected ERM cash flows prior to deductions (ie as a risk-free loan on any other adjustments (for example to allow for pre-payment risk) (in red). For the purposes of this SS, the remainder (in green) is referred to as the economic value of ERM cash flows. The PRA expects the Effective Value to be less than this amount. of the economic value should use methods and calibrations that are consistent with the other three principles. 3.13A Where the SPV holds assets other than ERMs, the PRA expects firms to take the value of these other assets into account when conducting the EVT only if they are held for a purpose that supports the restructuring of the ERMs, for example to improve the credit quality of the restructured ERM notes, or to assist with risk or liquidity management, subject to the following Other than as noted in (v) below, the balance sheet value of the other assets should be calculated in accordance with the PRA Rulebook and any other relevant requirements. This value of the other assets should be added to the economic value of ERMs. When determining Effective Value, firms should allow for the balance sheet value of the other assets in valuing each tranche. In particular, firms should allow for the impact on the security of the senior tranches arising from the other assets, and ensure that the valuation, spread and mapped CQS of the senior tranches reflects the presence of the other assets in the SPV, having regard to paragraph 2.4 above. The PRA considers it would be difficult to demonstrate that the presence of a material value of other assets had no effect on the value or credit quality of the senior tranches and hence does not consider that it would be credible to assume that the value of the other assets was allocated in full to the junior tranche. The PRA expects firms to be able to justify any allocation to the junior tranche in relation to the design of its restructuring approach. Firms should allow for any basis and counterparty risk associated with the other assets, for example any derivative or reinsurance contracts based on a property index are exposed to the basis risk of idiosyncratic property movements, as well as counterparty risk. Firms should allow for relevant costs associated with the other assets, for example commitment fees associated with liquidity facilities used to support the credit ratings of the MA-eligible notes. For some assets other than ERMs, the PRA recognises that it may in principle be appropriate to depart from a balance sheet value calculated in accordance with the PRA Rulebook for the purposes of conducting the EVT. In particular the PRA considers this may in principle be appropriate for some assets held to (partially) hedge NNEG risk. Where either a firm or the PRA believes it is appropriate to adopt a bespoke valuation approach for assets other than ERMs for the purposes of conducting the EVT, the PRA expects firms to discuss and agree an appropriate valuation approach with their supervisor. In such cases, the PRA expects firms to justify the relationship between the value of the asset for the purposes of the EVT and the allowance for NNEG risk included in the calculation of economic value. The PRA expects firms to be able to demonstrate that the value of other assets has been allowed for in economic value and Effective Value in accordance with (i) - (v) above. 3.14 The EVT assessment will be carried out on a firm-by-firm basis to provide assurance that all of the risks to which the firm is exposed have been appropriately reflected, either in the value of the securitised assets or in the FS assigned to those assets in the MA portfolio. 3.15 This concept was introduced as the first proposition of paragraph 4.9 of Discussion Paper It is derived from the following considerations: Given the choice between an ERM and an equivalent loan without an NNEG, a market participant would choose the latter, since either the guarantee is not exercised, in which case the ERM and the loan have the same payoff, or it is, in which case the ERM pays less. Similarly, a market participant would prefer future possession of the property on exit to an ERM, given that the property will be of greater value than the ERM if the guarantee is not exercised, or the same value if it is. asset value decomposition 3.16 This statement is equivalent to the assertion that the deferment rate for a property is positive. The rationale can be seen by comparing the value of two contracts, one giving immediate possession of the property, the other giving possession ('deferred possession') whenever the exit occurs. The only difference between these contracts is the value of foregone rights (eg to income or use of the property) during the deferment period. This value should be positive for the residential properties used as collateral for ERMs. 3.17 It is important to note that views on future property growth play no role in preferring one contract over the other. Investors in both contracts will receive the benefit of future property growth (or suffer any property depreciation) because they will own the property at the end of the deferment period. Hence expectations of future property growth are irrelevant for this statement. to verify that all risks that have been retained by the firm on the assumption that it holds the ERMs until maturity have been appropriately reflected in the value assigned to the different tranches and the FS derived for those tranches in the MA portfolio. The NNEG component of the economic value decomposition should capture all of the risks to which the firm remains exposed as a result of giving this guarantee. The PRA's view is that the compensation for the risks that have been retained by the firm as a result of giving the NNEG will comprise more than the best estimate cost of the guarantee. This is consistent with the fact that the FS captures more than the expected cost of defaults: it also includes additional components for the cost of downgrades (eg calibrated as the cost of rebalancing the portfolio to maintain a certain probability of default), as well as a floor to allow for other sources of uncertainty in the cash flows. When considering the fair value of the ERMs, a rational investor would require compensation above and beyond the average outcome based on their best estimate assumptions, to reflect the risk of loss in adverse scenarios. The same analysis applies to securitised notes: the junior note should be held at fair value and the more a junior note is structured to absorb the risk from the NNEG (and other risks), the higher its spread should therefore be. 3.20 Firms can demonstrate that the Effective Value is less than the economic value of ERM cash flows (taking into account other assets held by the SPV in accordance with paragraph 3.13A) using the following approach for calculating NNEG risk. Firms should calculate the allowance for NNEG risk for the portfolio of loans as the sum of a series of allowances for each ERM for each annual period during which ERM cash flows could","['assessed', 'mortgages', 'assets', 'portfolios', 'equity']","['asset assessment', 'asset cqs', 'assets credit', 'assessments assets', 'credit assessment']","['assessments cqs asset', 'credit assessments assets', 'credit assessment cqs', 'internal credit assessments', 'credit assessments cqs']","['internal credit assessment criteria', 'ma portfolio credit quality step', 'internal credit assessments', 'internal credit rating assessments', 'credit risk assessments']"
897,r220920a_BOC,canada,2022-09-20,"Macroeconomics of the 2020s:  What we’ve learned, and what’s to come",beaudry,0,"Good afternoon, and thank you for inviting me to present this year's Distinguished Lecture in Economics. I'm honoured to be the ninth lecturer to take this stage. I would especially like to thank Professor Francisco Gonzales for thinking of me for today's talk. Francisco and I have known each other for almost 20 years and have discussed many economic issues during that time. I hope that some of the concepts I will address today--especially spillovers and the value of coordination--will resonate with him, and with students who have had the pleasure of taking his classes. I'm very happy to be here in person after more than two years of virtual and hybrid events. COVID-19 has certainly disrupted many aspects of our lives--our physical and mental well-being, and our ability to study and work. Unfortunately, some of us even lost loved ones to this deadly virus. It goes without saying that the pandemic has also had unprecedented effects on the domestic and global economies. Never before had the entire world effectively battened down the hatches so quickly and all at once. And never before had we experienced the roller coaster of re-openings and closures that has taken place since March 2020. Now we're also dealing with supply chain disruptions, war in Ukraine and inflation that's higher than we've seen in decades. When COVID-19 first hit, the Bank of Canada--and many other central banks-- took a series of actions. Some were new and innovative in response to the situation before us. Others stemmed from the playbooks we used during other crises. This is a key approach to policy-making: we draw from past experiences to figure out what actions will best support the economy, keep inflation on target and protect the well-being of households and businesses.  Looking back now, I believe we got a lot of things right when trying to manage the economic fallout from the pandemic. But in other areas, we could have done better. So today, with the benefit of hindsight, I want to talk about some early lessons we can draw from this episode. I'll discuss what worked, and where we could improve our response to future downturns. I'll focus specifically on three issues. The first is how international spillovers have been shaping the macroeconomic landscape. Here I'm thinking about how countries responded to and are recovering from the pandemic, and how policy-makers' actions in individual countries affected global outcomes. And I'll emphasize how cross-country interactions played out differently during the pandemic than they did in other recessions, such as the one that followed the 2008-09 global financial crisis Second, I'd like to compare the strong rebound that we've seen in the labour market with the jobless recoveries that advanced economies sometimes experienced in the past. Here I'll stress how these differences partly reflect the way policy shaped the evolution of public and private sector balance sheets. Finally, I'll look ahead to an issue on so many minds these days: inflation. Just this morning new numbers were released. In August, inflation stood at 7%. While we're headed in the right direction, that's still too high. Consumers and businesses are rightfully wondering when we'll stop feeling the pinch of high prices. And so I'll talk about the role that expectations play in driving inflation, how central banks try to influence those expectations and what this means for the Bank of Canada as we guide inflation back to our 2% target. Let's start by noting that Canada has a small open economy, accounting for less than 1.5% of global gross domestic product. We are integrated with, and dependent on, global trade partners. So what happens elsewhere has significant impacts on the Canadian economy. This situation isn't unique to Canada. Most countries are small in this sense. Accordingly, policy-makers in individual countries often take global conditions as given. This means they focus on making monetary and fiscal policy choices that best serve their national interests. They may not necessarily internalize all the spillovers those choices might impose on other countries. Now, it's not always possible or appropriate to act in ways that consider these spillovers. But it's important to understand how the policy choices of individual countries collectively determine the overall level of global stimulus and to consider whether that level is appropriate. Accordingly, spillovers are a regular topic on the agendas for international forums like the G7 and G20. The  conversations we have around those tables can help identify areas where some degree of coordination could make all countries better off. Of course, spillovers are complicated, and modelling and measuring them are challenging. However, during periods when many countries are recovering from large global shocks--like COVID-19 or the GFC--we can look at spillovers as operating mainly through two dimensions. The first is a real activity dimension. Stimulus in one country boosts imports of goods and services from other countries, raising demand around the globe and thereby supporting the recovery. The second is the inflation dimension. It relates to how stimulus measures also raise prices for many internationally traded goods. And during COVID-19, unprecedented supply chain disruptions caused an additional layer of problems. I talked earlier about how policy-makers looked back on previous crises when navigating the pandemic. A lot of literature on policy-makers' responses to the GFC and its aftermath focuses on the real activity dimension. Specifically, some research proposes that slower withdrawals of fiscal stimulus following the GFC could have made all countries better off through positive demand spillovers. Put differently, a more gradual global withdrawal process could have allowed each country to benefit more fully from the demand boost triggered by its trading partners' stimulus efforts. That lesson has coloured many fiscal policy-makers' thinking as we come out of COVID-19, with many conversations at the international level focused on avoiding premature withdrawals of stimulus. However, no two crises are created equal. A distinctive feature of the GFC was that many sectors and countries were left facing levels of demand well below available supply, and for extended periods of time. This excess capacity meant that price pressures associated with stimulus measures were modest. The inflation dimension was therefore a relatively small part of the overall story during this period. The COVID-19 crisis was clearly very different. Even when countries were experiencing excess supply overall, key sectors were operating at or near capacity limits, including many sectors that rely on internationally traded goods. Bottlenecks occurred in these sectors because of demand surges driven by a combination of stimulus policies, shutdowns and re-openings as well as by consumers shifting away from services.  Normally when demand goes up following a recession, supply responds strongly. But during the pandemic, supply couldn't keep up because of public health protocols and shutdowns. This caused delays in consumers getting their hands on goods like bicycles and furniture. So prices rose more sharply than usual. Compared with the GFC, this resulted in a stronger response on the inflation dimension and a weaker response on the activity dimension. So one country's decision to maintain stimulus disproportionately impacted others through the effects of that stimulus on the prices of globally traded goods. For instance, as US stimulus spread through the economy and led to a greater demand for new vehicles, Taiwan--a key manufacturer of microchips needed to make modern vehicles--was struggling to adapt its production processes and facing long backlogs of orders. Instead of stimulus-induced demand leading to more output, this bottleneck meant global automobile production stalled and prices increased--not only in the United States, but also in Canada and around the world. The net result was that, during the recovery phase of the pandemic, it's likely a somewhat faster global withdrawal process could have made all countries better off. To summarize, lessons from the GFC informed key parts of the policy response to the pandemic. However, in hindsight, policy-makers everywhere should have been more alert to the possibility that the nature of global spillovers can change over time. A better understanding of these dynamics and how policy actions can ripple around the world should enable more effective global responses to future shocks. Next, I'd like to discuss how the labour market has recovered from the pandemic. I'll also talk about the role that balance sheets have played in making that recovery stronger than recoveries following previous downturns. The left-hand panel of Chart 1 shows how unusual the recovery phase of the pandemic has been relative to historical experience. Despite an unprecedented initial drop, Canadian employment took only about 20 months to return to its prerecession peak. This is about 6 months faster than we experienced coming out of the GFC, and at least 18 months ahead of the tepid recoveries that followed recessions in the 1980s and 1990s. As shown in the right-hand panel, the difference in the recoveries following COVID-19 and the GFC was even more pronounced in the United States. Research and history teach us a lot about the forces that made many previous recoveries so slow. One lesson is that recessions that take a significant toll on the financial health of businesses, financial institutions or households are often followed by weak recoveries.  A good example is the United States during the GFC, when a collapse in house prices left many indebted households and financial institutions over-leveraged or even in negative net wealth positions. That set the scene for what's known as a ""balance sheet recession."" During this type of recession, key parts of the private sector are focused on rebuilding healthier balance sheets. That rebuilding process takes time. Paying down debt and accumulating savings may be good in the long term. But, in the short term, having many firms and households preoccupied with these issues doesn't support strong demand and a fast recovery. Even for economies not directly impacted by the initial underlying shocks--like Canada during the GFC--having a trading partner caught in these balance sheet headwinds can be a major drag. This is an example of what economists call the ""paradox of thrift,"" a situation where savings decisions that seem sensible at the individual level lead to insufficient spending overall. In other words, too much personal savings can be a drag on overall economic growth during recessions and recoveries. Another example of this paradox is when the risk of unemployment rises during a recession, leading some households to cut back on spending and focus on building precautionary savings. This may make sense for individuals, but it takes a toll on total spending and demand. As businesses respond to that weaker  demand, they can even set off a self-fulfilling spiral of higher unemployment and stronger precautionary savings incentives, worsening the initial downturn. It's easy to imagine how such mechanisms could have resulted in a much deeper downturn and slower recovery associated with COVID-19. Luckily, policy-makers had learned from previous episodes, and their strong responses over the past two and a half years helped prevent the unusual savings and balance sheet dynamics that often hobble recoveries. Fiscal policy measures clearly prevented a worse outcome. These included a range of wage and income supports that helped preserve private sector balance sheets and supported consumption. Monetary policy played an important supporting role. For example, disruptions in financial markets in early 2020 could have layered a serious financial crisis on top of a devastating health crisis. But central banks around the world aggressively lowered their policy rates and deployed a range of facilities that kept markets functioning and credit flowing. And the next two years saw central banks use forceful combinations of conventional and unconventional stimulus to support consumption and guide their economies to strong recoveries. As you'll see in Chart 2, these fiscal and monetary policy measures effectively expanded public sector balance sheets to offset pressures that would have strained balance sheets in the private sector. Of course, such policy measures are not without their costs or risks. And taking prudent steps to normalize government and central bank balance sheets is important to help bring down inflation today and ensure room to respond to future downturns. At the Bank of Canada, this normalization is underway with our quantitative tightening program.  All told, there are encouraging lessons to be learned from the speed and scale with which policy-makers were able to marshal stimulus measures in response to COVID-19. This allowed the Canadian and other economies to bypass many of the pain points that often follow recessions--setting the scene for a historic bounce back in labour markets. With many students in the audience, I'll also stress that young people-- especially those who recently entered the labour market--have been key beneficiaries of this. In past recessions, scarring effects meant that people entering the labour market often took years to catch up to other cohorts. I certainly don't want to imply that coming into the labour market over the past few years has been easy. But the rapid recovery and abundant employment opportunities have meant that new entrants are better positioned to find jobs that match their qualifications. That's helped many young people start their careers on firm footing, which is good news for them and for our economy. While the previous two topics come with the benefit of hindsight, my final topic is something we're still squarely in the middle of--the ongoing battle to bring inflation back to our 2% target.  Since we introduced inflation targeting in 1991, the Bank has been largely successful at keeping inflation low, stable and predictable. Because of this, Canadians had grown to expect that this would remain the case. So they generally behaved accordingly, making saving and spending decisions and salary demands based on inflation running around 2%. Today, that record is being seriously tested as we emerge from the first global pandemic in a century and face the effects of Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. Both factors are contributing to inflation levels well above our target while also raising short- and medium-term inflation expectations as seen in Chart 3. Monetary policy is actively tightening to cool the economy and contain these pressures. Against this backdrop, a lot of discussion involves what monetary policy should do to minimize the risk that inflation expectations will drift persistently above our target. This is a process known as ""de-anchoring,"" and it can be associated with the self-fulfilling wage-price spirals that I warned against in my last speech. avoid this and bring inflation sustainably back to target, some have suggested that policy-makers may need to engineer a substantial slowdown--or even a recession.  I want to address these concerns. The best strategy for responding to high inflation--and, most importantly, for avoiding de-anchoring--depends partly on how people form their inflation expectations. So let me start with two very different theories of expectation formation and what they mean for the disinflation process. The first theory assumes that inflation expectations are backward-looking--or what economists call ""adaptive."" This means that households and businesses base their inflation expectations on past inflation, without trying to forecast how the future might differ from the past. Essentially, this theory says that people don't believe anything the central bank may say about inflation until they've seen it for themselves. An adaptive-expectations view implies that when inflation is high, inflation expectations will drift up, and central banks can't rely on simple communication about future policy to bring them back down. Instead, policy-makers must engineer a period of sufficient economic slack so that inflation falls, and these lower inflation outcomes then feed back into lower expectations over time. Researchers sometimes liken this to a process of earning credibility. This is because what eventually brings realized and expected inflation sustainably back to target is policy-makers showing that they're willing to tolerate a sizable downturn to get there. The second theory is the polar opposite--that expectations are what economists call ""rational."" This theory assumes that firms and households are forwardlooking and understand the economy and how monetary policy affects it. In particular, businesses and households are assumed to be capable of the mental gymnastics needed to process incoming data and assess their likely implications for future outcomes. Under this rational-expectations view, people's understanding that appropriate policy choices will eventually bring inflation back to target can help keep expectations close to target during periods of high inflation. To achieve this outcome, central banks must commit to an inflation target and communicate this clearly to households and firms. If the commitment is credible, then the private sector's anticipation that inflation will return to target in the long term sets off a series of price- and wage-setting decisions. And these decisions help keep inflation in line over the short and medium terms. This greatly reduces the need to engineer a period of significant economic slack to get back to target on a sustainable basis. The truth, as you can imagine, lies somewhere between these theories. History is helpful here. For example, an extensive literature focuses on the disinflation that  suggests that the associated downturns were larger than assumed with purely rational expectations, but they were not as severe as purely adaptive expectations would assume. At some level, you don't need an economist to tell you this. No one naively assumes that just because inflation is high today, it will stay there. Instead, people try their best to understand the economic environment and form expectations based on that understanding. However, that environment is complicated, so the mental gymnastics associated with fully rational expectations feels understandably foreign. In a stable environment where the central bank has established a credible track record, as a rule of thumb the private sector can quite safely assume that inflation will evolve close to target. Firms can then make price- and wage-setting decisions accordingly, and that generally leads to inflation outcomes not far from target. This has largely been the case in Canada for decades. However, with inflation now well above our target and its future trajectory uncertain, many firms feel less confident applying the rule of thumb I just described. Instead, they must directly confront the complexity of the economic environment, relying more heavily on their own knowledge and reasoning to predict inflation outcomes. This is where direct, effective monetary policy communication has an important role to play--helping to guide and coordinate these difficult reasoning processes. An important part of our mandate as Canada's central bank is to provide coherent, clear and relatable messages to those we serve. Equally important is reaching out to hear how our policies affect everyone. We are a public institution working on behalf of all citizens. Speaking and listening to Canadians is at the core of building trust and accountability. As the Governor recently put it, with so much uncertainty already out there, we don't want monetary policy to be an additional source of uncertainty. This is why the Bank is committed to keeping its communications during this difficult period clear, simple and focused on our inflation mandate. Our messages are designed to cut through the noise and simplify the difficult problems facing price- and wage-setters in this unusual environment. The more effective the Bank can be in its guiding role, the greater the chance of a soft landing--and the lower the risk of a hard landing. It's time for me to conclude. The COVID-19 pandemic has certainly brought its fair share of challenges to Canadian households, businesses and policy-makers. While experience from  past crises has played an important role in guiding our decisions, we truly have much more to learn. We at the Bank will continue to listen to Canadians, analyze the situation and grow our knowledge in order to best respond to downturns in the economy. We will work with our international partners to continuously improve how we respond as a group to shocks like the pandemic that have implications far beyond our own country's borders. We will continue to pay close attention to how this recovery differs from others we've experienced. This includes keeping an eye on the health of the labour market and on how public and private sector balance sheets evolve over time. And, most importantly, we will continue to take whatever actions are necessary to restore price stability for households and businesses and to maintain Canadians' confidence that we can deliver on our mandate of bringing inflation back to 2%. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to our discussion.","['covid', 'pandemic', 'crises', 'recessions', 'recession']","['pandemic implications', 'decades covid', 'recovering pandemic', 'covid 19', 'global pandemic']","['covid 19 crisis', 'covid 19 pandemic', 'decades covid 19', 'pandemic implications far', 'crises navigating pandemic']","['first global pandemic', 'pandemic', 'previous crises', 'other crises', 'devastating health crisis']"
4944,r220922a_SNB,switzerland,2022-09-22,Sixth Karl Brunner Distinguished Lecture - Introduction of Benjamin M. Friedman,jordan,1,"I am very pleased to welcome you all to the sixth Karl Brunner Distinguished Lecture. The Swiss National Bank established this annual lecture series in honour of the Swiss economist Karl Brunner, one of the leading monetary economists of the last century. Our aim with these lectures is to reach a broad audience, and to contribute to the public debate on issues related to central banking and economics more broadly. This year's Karl Brunner Distinguished Lecture is special for several reasons. After a threeyear break caused by the pandemic, the lecture finally returns to ETH Zurich. I am delighted to see so many of you here. I also want to thank Joel Mesot, President of ETH Zurich, for making these fantastic premises available to us yet again. Above all, this year's event is special because of the person giving the lecture. Benjamin Friedman is the William Joseph Maier Professor of Political Economy at Harvard University. He is one of the world's foremost thinkers on monetary policy and an outstanding public intellectual. In addition, he is among the few still active economists who knew Karl Brunner well. Even though they did not always agree on economic matters, the two maintained a close personal relationship characterised by mutual respect. The highest respect - coupled with a fair dose of nervousness - is also what I felt while sitting in the waiting room outside Ben's office, having just arrived at Harvard as a young post-doc. I will never forget the moment when I first entered Ben's office, with its traditional furniture and its walls packed with majestic books staring down at me. I could truly feel the vast amount of knowledge present in that room. Fortunately, Ben welcomed me warmly and my anxiety quickly dissipated. Indeed, I could not have hoped for a better mentor for my stay at Harvard. I have learned a great deal from Ben, not only as an economist, but also as a person. Benjamin Friedman is an unusual scholar in many respects. His research is extraordinarily broad and deep, as demonstrated by the topic of today's lecture, namely the influence of religious thinking on economic thinking. Some of you may ask what this has to do with the Swiss National Bank. While people's faith in the currency is an essential precondition for successful monetary policy, organising public lectures on religion may seem a little farfetched. However, allow me to reassure you that Ben has also published over 150 academic articles on monetary policy, macroeconomics and financial markets. He is therefore a most logical candidate to give the Karl Brunner Distinguished Lecture, even on a topic that may seem unusual at first sight. intention of studying law, but soon realised that economics suited him better. He pursued his studies at Harvard and at Cambridge University in England. Early in his career, Ben worked for various entities of the Federal Reserve System and at Morgan Stanley. In 1972, at the age of 25, he was appointed assistant professor of economics at Harvard University. Ben has remained a loyal faculty member at Harvard for five decades, including a three-year spell as the chairman of the economics department. When Ben recently celebrated 50 years as a professor at Harvard, many of his former students travelled from all around the world to attend the occasion. The interaction with his students has been of utmost importance to Ben, and he would remain in contact with them for decades following their graduation. A number of these former students today occupy leading positions in academia, central banking and government. This shows that Ben has been not only an outstanding researcher, but also an influential teacher of economics. Spending 50 years in the same place is not as unusual as one might think, at least not when we consider some of the great Enlightenment thinkers Ben so deeply admires. Take Immanuel Kant, who developed his philosophy without ever leaving his hometown of Konigsberg. According to legend, Kant became such an integral part of the city that people would set their watch by the time he left his house for his afternoon walk. Whether Ben's daily routines have the same effect on the people in Cambridge, Massachusetts, we do not know. What we do know is that, fortunately for us, Ben is not quite as averse to travelling as Kant was. Most importantly, he lets his mind travel, exploring not only the world of economics but many other disciplines as well. But let me say a few more words about Ben's contributions to monetary economics. His research covers all aspects of monetary policy. It spans everything from the technical details of how central banks steer short-term interest rates in money markets to fundamental questions about the mandate lawmakers should give to central banks. Doing justice to this vast body of work in a few sentences is impossible. I will therefore limit myself to a few key elements. Characteristic of Ben's work is the critical analysis of ideas that have become fashionable in the profession. In the 1970s and 80s, when monetary targeting was in its heyday, Ben argued that central banks were too focused on the money supply and did not pay enough attention to other variables. In a number of influential papers, he showed that the amount of outstanding credit in the economy may be a useful predictor of future output and prices. Ben concluded that credit should play an important role in central banks' decision making. The extent to which central banks should pay attention to credit aggregates remains a hotly debated question to this day. Ben was among the first to highlight their potential significance for monetary policy. Another example of Ben's tendency to go against the mainstream is his critique of the use of rational expectations in macroeconomic models. When the rational expectations revolution transformed the field of macroeconomics in the late 1970s, Ben remained sceptical. He criticised the assumption that economic agents form their expectations based on a perfect understanding of how the economy works. These models did not address the question of how economic agents derive this knowledge in the first place. More recently, the literature has begun to develop models with forward-looking agents that have a limited understanding of how the economy works. This research programme is very much in the spirit of Ben's early criticism. A final example of Ben's willingness to challenge the accepted wisdom of the day is his reservations about inflation targeting. When one central bank after another started to adopt inflation targeting in the 1990s, Ben became one of the most prominent critics of this new monetary policy strategy. His concern was that inflation targeting would lead central banks to focus single-mindedly on price stability. In doing so, Ben feared, they might lose sight of their ultimate goal of promoting economic well-being more broadly. Ben is widely recognised as one of the world's leading macroeconomists. However, his research interests go far beyond that. Ben is a polymath, something that has become rare in modern academia. His writings cross academic boundaries between economics, philosophy, history and religion. An excellent example of Ben's interdisciplinary work is his book 'The countless papers on how to increase growth. But very few have addressed the question of why growth is desirable in the first place, in particular for societies that are already rich. Ben's book fills this gap. It argues that economic growth improves the moral character of society. People tend to be more generous and tolerant towards each other when the economy grows. Economic stagnation, on the other hand, is associated with repression and bigotry. Ben's latest book, 'Religion and the Rise of Capitalism', was published last year. It describes how religion has shaped economic thinking since the beginning of our discipline. The early economic thinkers of the European Enlightenment, such as Adam Smith, were not committed to religion. Ben argues, however, that their world view was profoundly influenced by developments in religious thinking. There is therefore a close connection between religion and the beginning of modern capitalism. With this I would like to conclude my remarks, since you are surely eager to learn more about this fascinating topic from Ben himself. Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming Benjamin Friedman with a big round of applause.","['economist', 'economists', 'economics', 'brunner', 'friedman']","['swiss economist', 'economist karl', 'ben economist', 'lecture swiss', 'karl brunner']","['economist karl brunner', 'swiss economist karl', 'brunner leading monetary', 'distinguished lecture swiss', 'brunner distinguished lecture']","['swiss economist karl brunner', 'karl brunner distinguished lecture', 'sixth karl brunner distinguished lecture', 'karl brunner', 'monetary economists']"
4946,r220922c_SNB,switzerland,2022-09-22,"Introductory remarks, news conference",schlegel,0,"Against the backdrop of current interest rate movements, I would like to give you a brief assessment of developments on the mortgage and real estate markets. Alongside other factors such as construction activity, income and demographics, interest rates have an impact on the real estate market and on demand for mortgages. In turn, mortgage and real estate markets play a key role for banks and financial stability. After a long period of extremely low interest rates, interest rate levels on the money and capital markets in Switzerland have risen substantially since the beginning of the year. As a consequence, interest rates for fixed mortgages have also increased, while rates for SARON mortgages have remained low. Until now, these interest rate developments have had little effect on growth in the mortgage and real estate markets. Prices for single-family houses and privately owned apartments have continued to rise and mortgage volume has also grown further. One possible reason is that actual interest costs for real estate purchases have increased only slightly due to the shift from fixed-rate mortgages to SARON mortgages. By contrast, there are signs of a slowdown in the residential investment property segment. Available data for apartment buildings indicate a slight reduction in prices in the second quarter. Looking ahead, the tightening of monetary policy should also help to ease the risk situation on the mortgage and real estate markets. However, given that vulnerabilities on these markets are still high, the resilience of the banking system remains crucial. In January 2022, the Federal Council approved the SNB's proposal to reactivate the countercyclical capital buffer. This buffer will come into effect at the end of September and will contribute to maintaining banking system resilience.","['mortgages', 'mortgage', 'markets', 'houses', 'investment']","['mortgages saron', 'demand mortgages', 'saron mortgages', 'mortgages increased', 'rate mortgages']","['rates saron mortgages', 'mortgages increased rates', 'rate mortgages saron', 'market demand mortgages', 'saron mortgages contrast']","['saron mortgages', 'rate mortgages', 'real estate markets', 'interest rate developments', 'current interest rate movements']"
4945,r220922d_SNB,switzerland,2022-09-22,"Introductory remarks, news conference",maechler,0,"As Thomas Jordan has indicated, I will now discuss some important aspects of the implementation of our monetary policy in the money market. With today's interest rate decision, we are bringing a period of a negative SNB policy rate to an end. To ensure that the secured short-term Swiss franc money market rates remain close to the SNB policy rate in a positive interest rate environment, we are adjusting our implementation approach. Our approach now consists of the following two elements. The first is a tiered remuneration of the sight deposits that banks and other financial market participants hold at the SNB. We remunerate sight deposits up to an individual threshold at the SNB policy rate. Sight deposits above this threshold are remunerated at an interest rate of zero percent. The individual thresholds are based on the calculation of exemption thresholds in a negative interest rate environment used to date. The tiered remuneration of sight deposits creates an incentive for account holders to carry out money market transactions with each other even in a situation of liquidity surplus. These transactions contribute to a robust basis for the calculation of The second element is the absorption of liquidity by way of open market operations. With these operations, we reduce the sight deposits and thereby the liquidity supply in the money market. In this way, we ensure that SARON and the other secured short-term money market rates remain close to the now positive SNB policy rate. To absorb liquidity by way of open market operations, we will use two proven monetary policy instruments: SNB Bills and repo transactions. Participants in the Swiss franc money market are familiar with both instruments. We have used repo transactions regularly in previous years. SNB Bills are debt certificates issued by the SNB, typically with a term of up to one year. We last used SNB Bills for the implementation of monetary policy in 2011 and have since conducted tests to ensure operational readiness. We expect the volume of SNB Bills issued to increase within a short period of time on the back of the weekly auctions. The new interest rates on sight deposits apply as of tomorrow. The open market operations to absorb liquidity are being conducted with immediate effect. To ensure that our monetary policy is being implemented effectively, we will subject the instruments used to regular review. Further adjustments may be made if necessary.","['deposits', 'monetary', 'liquidity', 'banks', 'snb']","['snb policy', 'deposits liquidity', 'deposits threshold', 'deposits banks', 'implementation monetary']","['threshold snb policy', 'positive snb policy', 'negative snb policy', 'deposits threshold remunerated', 'snb policy rate']","['swiss franc money market rates', 'negative snb policy rate', 'positive snb policy rate', 'swiss franc money market', 'snb policy rate']"
4947,r220923a_SNB,switzerland,2022-09-23,Safeguarding the principles of regulatory policy,jordan,1,"Ladies and gentlemen Today's event focuses on the question 'Is monetary policy still regulatory policy today?'. I congratulate the University of Lucerne on choosing this important topic. Discussions surrounding regulatory policy have faded somewhat into the background of late. For the Swiss National Bank, however, the principles of regulatory policy - in particular those concerning monetary policy - remain of great significance. I am pleased to give you our view on this topic. In my remarks, I will therefore pay special attention to Switzerland and the SNB. First, I will look at why, for the SNB, the two regulatory principles of a clear focus on ensuring price stability and independence from politics are closely related. I will then show why these principles are contradicted by a number of recently launched political initiatives. To conclude, I would like to explain the SNB's current monetary policy. In general, regulatory policy comprises all measures which a government puts in place to create appropriate framework conditions for the longer-term development of the economy. If, in doing so, the government follows sensible principles, it creates conditions in which the economy can optimally develop its potential and the prosperity of the population increases over time. An essential component of good framework conditions, and of good regulatory policy, is price stability. In the absence of price stability, the smooth functioning of an economy is inconceivable. Inflation as well as deflation hinder the steering role of prices in ensuring that labour and capital are used as productively as possible. Inflation also reduces household purchasing power and especially impacts the more vulnerable sections of society. In order to ensure price stability in the long term, two principles of regulatory policy are key: - First, price stability must be the fundamental guiding principle of monetary policy - and second, a central bank must be independent from politics. Both of these principles are today reflected in the legislation of many countries. In Switzerland, the independence of the central bank is enshrined in the Federal Constitution. This means that the SNB may neither accept nor seek instruction from politics or other quarters. The Constitution also states that the SNB shall pursue a monetary policy serving the interests of the country as a whole. The National Bank Act sets out this task and stipulates that the SNB is to ensure price stability and in so doing take due account of economic developments. To this end, the SNB has suitable and effective instruments to influence the interest rate level as well as the exchange rate, and thereby monetary conditions. The appropriateness of monetary conditions determines whether price stability can be ensured in the long term. However, why is a task of such economic significance as monetary policy delegated to an independent institution in the first place? The most important reason is that governments generally have an incentive to use monetary policy for reasons other than price stability. For example, governments may have an interest in stimulating the economy before an election. Governments may want to finance public spending via the central bank's banknote printing press. When monetary policy pursues such objectives, over time it inevitably leads to high inflation. An independent central bank, however, is not subject to the same incentives and is protected from the influences of government. It can - and must - therefore devote its full attention to the mandate of ensuring price stability. The independence of the central bank is thus based on the conviction that price stability is desirable for society as a whole and that it can only be ensured over the long term by a monetary policy that is protected from political influence. In many currency areas, independence is therefore tightly coupled with the mandate of price stability. This is also the case in Switzerland. To legitimise its independence, the lawmakers have deliberately given the SNB a narrow and clearly defined mandate. They also place upon the SNB the duty of accountability of the fulfilment of its mandate. Pursuing objectives that go beyond the core task of monetary policy would undermine the legitimacy of the SNB's independence and thus endanger it over time. The institutional framework of the SNB is in line with both of the principles of regulatory policy I have described, namely independence from politics and a focus on monetary policy. In recent years, time and again these principles have been consciously or unconsciously questioned by some in politics and among the public. This has seen calls from politicians for the SNB to directly finance government tasks. For example, a popular initiative launched this spring seeks to amend the Constitution to give the SNB a direct role in financing the national pension scheme. Before I delve into why the direct financing of government tasks by the SNB is not in keeping with the principles of regulatory policy, it is helpful to first contextualise the SNB's profit development. For it is likely that the increase in these desires is tied above all to the growth of our balance sheet and our high profits in the past few years. These high profits have led to an increase in our so-called distribution reserve. At the end of 2021, it amounted to CHF 103 billion. The distribution reserve exists because the SNB does not pay out all of the distributable profit at once. It corresponds to a profit or loss carried forward in the balance sheet and is part of the SNB's equity capital. The distribution reserve helps to smooth the annual distributions to the Confederation and the cantons by serving as a buffer that balances out the fluctuations between years with profits and years with losses. The level of the distribution reserve in recent years has led some observers to overestimate the potential for SNB distributions and view the annual distribution of up to CHF 6 billion as too low. However, the good results of the past few years were achieved during an exceptional financial market environment shaped by globally declining interest rates, low inflation, high liquidity and rising share prices. But this environment has now changed sharply. In the first half of 2022, interest rates increased worldwide and stock markets declined, leading to considerable price losses on the SNB's bonds and shares. The accumulated book profits from the past were reversed by a book loss. The SNB recorded a loss of around CHF 95 billion for the first half of 2022, which corresponds to almost the entire distribution reserve. The current profit distribution approach is therefore not - as has often been criticised - overly cautious. The loss in the first half of the year underlines that a larger balance sheet is accompanied by larger fluctuations in absolute terms in the annual result, and that substantial profits can be followed by substantial losses. This clearly demonstrates why the government must not make its financing dependent on SNB profits. Which brings me to the problems associated with the SNB directly financing government tasks. The direct financing of government tasks by the SNB creates a situation whereby the fulfilment of these tasks becomes directly dependent on monetary policy. This is because our monetary policy may influence our annual result, and thus also the distribution. For example, tightening our monetary policy can lead to an appreciation of the Swiss franc, which lowers the return on our foreign currency investments after conversion into Swiss francs. Thus by directly linking certain government tasks to the SNB's distributions, monetary policy decisions take on a political dimension. Political pressure on the conduct of monetary policy will inevitably increase, thereby endangering the SNB's independence. Furthermore, the direct financing of government tasks blurs the clear focus of monetary policy on price stability. The direct link between government tasks and the SNB's earnings can lead to unnecessary conflicts of interest in monetary policy decisions. This in turn can give rise to doubts as to whether the SNB is prepared at all times to take the measures necessary to ensure price stability. Such doubts can ultimately lead to an expectation of higher inflation and therefore complicate monetary policy. Seen from the perspective of regulatory policy, demands for the SNB to directly finance government tasks are therefore to be clearly rejected. The SNB's monetary policy must not be driven by profit or loss. These are just by-products of our monetary policy. Our mandate is to conduct a monetary policy that ensures price stability in the medium and long term while taking due account of economic developments. Price stability is the most important contribution the SNB can make to our country. The SNB will therefore continue to advocate a framework for monetary policy based on the principles of regulatory policy. Ladies and gentlemen, the current global situation highlights the importance of central banks' focus on price stability. The monetary policy environment has changed considerably due to the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. After years of expansionary monetary policy aimed at preventing inflation from falling too low, the central banks of many countries are today faced with the challenge of fighting inflation that is too high. I will therefore close by saying a few words about the SNB's current monetary policy. Inflation in Switzerland is lower than abroad. However, in this country, too, it has still increased much more than was generally expected. At 3.5%, it is at its highest level since the 1990s. It is considerably above the range the SNB equates with price stability, namely between 0% and 2% over the medium term. How is the SNB handling this situation? We made our initial response to the emerging inflationary pressure already in the final months of last year. At the time, both inflation and also our inflation forecast were still at a low level. Abroad, however, inflation had already increased markedly. In order to reduce the inflationary pressure from abroad, at our monetary policy assessment in December 2021 we announced that the SNB would allow the Swiss franc to appreciate to a certain extent in nominal terms. The Swiss franc appreciated nominally by around 4% between autumn 2021 and spring 2022, making imports cheaper and so countering the general increase in prices. In June 2022, we then raised the SNB policy rate by half a percentage point to -0.25%. Yesterday, we tightened our monetary policy further and raised the SNB policy rate by 0.75 percentage points to 0.5%. It cannot be ruled out that further increases in the SNB policy rate will be necessary to ensure price stability over the medium term. To provide appropriate monetary conditions, we are also willing to be active in the foreign exchange market as necessary . Our tighter monetary policy is countering the renewed rise in inflationary pressure and the spread of inflation to goods and services that have so far been less affected. For there are growing signs that higher prices are increasingly spreading to goods and services that are not directly affected by the war in Ukraine or the consequences of the pandemic . In addition, energy prices have continued to rise overall and are increasing inflationary pressure in many sectors. This heightens the risk of second-round effects. Ladies and gentlemen, the inflation and economic outlook remains subject to high uncertainty. Ensuring price stability is a challenge and demands the full attention of the SNB. Thank you.","['regulatory', 'snb', 'monetary', 'banks', 'bank']","['policy monetary', 'monetary policy', 'snb regulatory', 'snb policy', 'stability monetary']","['monetary policy regulatory', 'snb monetary policy', 'concerning monetary policy', 'principle monetary policy', 'framework monetary policy']","['monetary policy', 'monetary policy environment', 'monetary policy decisions', 'current monetary policy', 'swiss national bank']"
3236,r220926b_ECB,euro area,2022-09-26,Demystifying wholesale central bank digital currency,panetta,0,"Let me first thank the Deutsche Bundesbank, and President Nagel in particular, for inviting me to speak at today's symposium. I would like to use this opportunity to discuss the implications of rapid technological change for our payment systems. I will focus not on people's daily transactions, but on the infrastructure that underpins the smooth functioning and stability of our financial system. Payments have long been an underestimated aspect of the monetary system, running reliably in the background and allowing the smooth implementation of policies in other areas, which took the spotlight. But a burst of creative digital innovation is now breaking this perception. This is most visible in the area of retail payments. The digitalisation of finance has broadened the available payment options. Fintech start-ups have emerged. Big techs have entered the payments market, capitalising on the networks they operate. The crypto universe has boomed and burst. These disruptions show that we need to preserve - at all times - an anchor of stability for the monetary and payments systems. Safeguarding this anchor is what our digital euro project is about. We want to ensure that central bank money remains available for the public to use everywhere in the euro area for their day-to-day transactions - not just in its physical form, but in digital form too. But we are also actively working to modernise the payment infrastructure underpinning our financial system. Technologies and preferences are changing, and preserving the role of central bank money as a safe asset at the heart of the system remains key. It strengthens the confidence in the smooth functioning of the financial system. The discussion on the wholesale version of central bank digital currencies - wholesale CBDC for short - is often prone to confusion, however. Wholesale CBDC is generally presented as something new, made possible by the emergence of distributed ledger technology (DLT). But wholesale CBDC has existed for decades. And it has provided efficient digital infrastructures for the settlement of transactions between banks in central bank money. The discussion about wholesale CBDC should therefore focus on how existing infrastructures have to be adapted as technologies and needs evolve. Today I would like to demystify this concept of wholesale CBDC. I will first clarify what wholesale CBDC is and what it is not. I will discuss the emerging need to adapt the wholesale infrastructure to evolving user demands. And then I will outline some of the technological choices that lie ahead. Let me start by clarifying some frequent misunderstandings about wholesale CBDC. First, there is confusion surrounding the term ""wholesale"". Wholesale CBDC refers to the settlement of interbank transfers and related wholesale transactions in central bank reserves. But some misinterpret ""wholesale CBDC"" to mean any large-value payment in central bank money, regardless of who is making and receiving the payment. Second, there is a widespread misconception that wholesale CBDC does not yet exist. In fact, central bank money has been available in digital form for wholesale transactions between banks for decades. This misconception is fuelled by the commonly held assumption that wholesale CBDC needs to be operated using DLT. But wholesale CBDC is not synonymous with DLT, as it can be based on any digital technology. In the euro area, the Eurosystem offers banks the possibility of settling wholesale digital transactions through its TARGET Services using a centralised ledger. Third, wholesale CBDC is sometimes seen as a substitute for retail CBDC. But in reality they complement each other by addressing the different needs of different users. On the wholesale side, central banks supply the ultimate means of payment for financial institutions, which helps to reduce risks in the financial system. On the retail side, providing the public with highly convenient and secure means of payment helps to underpin confidence in money by enabling private forms of money to be converted, at par, into risk-free central bank money. Wholesale and retail CBDC projects also differ in several ways. To begin with, they have very different starting points. Central bank money has traditionally only been made available to the general public in physical form - in other words, cash. The aim of retail CBDCs is to create a digital form of central bank money that can be used by everyone. In contrast, central bank money already exists in digital form for wholesale purposes. Wholesale CBDC projects are about making digital interbank transactions, such as securities settlement and cross-currency payments, safer and more efficient. This in turn means that different actors are involved in retail and wholesale CBDC projects. Retail CBDC projects involve a wide range of stakeholders: legislators, the retail payments ecosystem and the broader public. This is because retail CBDC is new. How it is designed and distributed needs to be considered very carefully to ensure that it responds to public policy objectives and does not have unintended effects on financial intermediation. Work on wholesale CBDC, meanwhile, involves a narrower set of stakeholders that already use digital central bank settlement infrastructures today, such as banks or central securities depositories. And in the future, new stakeholders could potentially take part in the wholesale settlement chain using new technologies such as DLT. So when central banks talk about wholesale CBDCs, we are not debating whether to introduce them. We are discussing how to improve and modernise services that we already offer today. I would therefore like to focus on our continuous efforts to improve wholesale payment systems. These efforts are necessary for market participants to remain confident that they can always settle systemically important wholesale liquidity and securities transactions with central bank money. Central bank money is the safest and most liquid settlement asset , so using it in this context helps to reduce risks in the financial system, thereby protecting financial stability. This, in turn, preserves the transmission of monetary policy and supports trust in the single currency. Over the past two decades, significant progress has been made in integrating and modernising wholesale payment systems. The transition from the national real-time gross settlement systems to TARGET in 1999, and then to TARGET2 in 2007, led to the first pan-European integrated market infrastructure for large-value wholesale payments. This enabled the rapid and reliable settlement of euro payments in central bank money. The subsequent launch of TARGET2-Securities harmonised post-trade services for financial instruments, bringing an end to complex cross-border settlement procedures. And in 2018 we introduced TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS), which allows instant retail payments to be settled in real time between banks across the EU, around the clock on every day of the year. In recent years, we have been working on a new consolidated TARGET platform - a complex infrastructure that would offer the market enhanced and modernised services. We are also building a Eurosystem Collateral Management System to simplify processes that involve multiple jurisdictions, notably the mobilisation of cross-border collateral. And we are seeking to ensure that the TARGET Services remain resilient to cyber threats. Looking ahead, we are considering how the needs of the users of our wholesale settlement services might change and whether new technologies could make settlement in wholesale digital central bank money more efficient and secure. In particular, we are assessing the potential of DLT and the extent to which it could improve our services. Market players that are active in payments and securities settlement, such as banks and financial market infrastructures, are already experimenting with DLT. Our ongoing engagement with these stakeholders reveals that many of them expect DLT to experience a significant uptake in the financial industry. This would entail a shift from using centralised databases for transferring cash and assets to using decentralised networks instead. Proponents of DLT highlight a range of benefits, such as the possibility of settling transactions instantly, around the clock, in a wider range of assets and with a broader spectrum of participants, potentially including non-financial corporations. Users of DLT platforms could also program transactions to be settled automatically based on predefined conditions. Stakeholders expect DLT to be used prominently for securities post-trade processes, where it could help to reduce costs, processing times and the need for reconciliation. Some market players see the potential for efficiency gains by using DLT along the whole lifecycle of a security. And in the area of wholesale payments, market stakeholders see the potential for DLT to improve cross-border and cross-currency transactions, as it would overcome some of the frictions related to correspondent banking. But experiments conducted by both private firms and central banks must still prove that DLT can offer more benefits than existing technologies. Indeed, the potential advantages of DLT can also be obtained in other ways. Fast payment systems - such as the Eurosystem's TIPS - prove that 24/7 instant payments do not require DLT. And questions about who can access central bank money for wholesale transactions, or which types of assets should be settled against central bank money, are unrelated to the technology used. Furthermore, automated and conditional payments can also be initiated through application programming interfaces (APIs). Notably, there are initiatives that seek to improve wholesale transactions using conventional technologies. For example, interlinking existing systems could improve the efficiency of cross-currency transactions. Where similar objectives could be achieved both with and without DLT, the costs and merits of each option should be compared before moving in either direction. And we need to consider the potential drawbacks of DLT. For example, the consensus mechanisms that some DLT networks use to validate transactions are inefficient, both from an environmental point of view - as they require large amounts of energy - and in terms of transaction speed and scalability. These concerns are most evident for DLTs, such as bitcoin. Some DLTs are less energy-intensive but may still compare unfavourably to centralised infrastructures. Importantly, the of major DLT technologies and networks is dominated by actors who are either unknown or based outside Europe, which raises concerns about strategic autonomy. But despite the uncertainties surrounding DLT's potential, we want to be prepared for a scenario where market players adopt DLT for wholesale payments and securities settlement. We must ensure that, in such a scenario, central bank money would still retain its role as the settlement asset for wholesale transactions. If, for example, market players start to use DLT for securities settlement but face difficulties using TARGET Services , they may turn to alternatives like commercial bank money or stablecoins. This would entail a number of risks, such as central bank money having a reduced role in settlement processes, as well as trading and liquidity becoming fragmented. The result would be payments and securities settlement becoming less safe and less efficient, which would undermine financial stability. The use of stablecoins would magnify these risks. As we have seen in recent months, stablecoins are prone to runs. In other words, they are stable in name only. And allowing them to be fully backed with central bank money would effectively outsource the provision of central bank money to private entities, endangering monetary sovereignty. A shift away from central bank settlement systems would also imply that authorities would lose direct access to settlement data. This could slow the speed of intervention in the event of settlement bottlenecks and impair the analysis of financial stability. The Eurosystem is therefore exploring ways in which market participants who adopt DLT could interact with the TARGET Services to settle the euro cash leg of their transactions in central bank money. We are analysing two options. The first would entail creating a bridge between market DLT platforms and central bank infrastructures. This would allow a securities transfer on a DLT platform to trigger settlement in central bank money. It is very likely that a solution that builds on the existing TARGET Services could be implemented more rapidly than a solution based entirely on DLT. Another option would be to create a new DLT-based wholesale settlement service with DLT-based central bank money. The Eurosystem could, for instance, launch its own DLT platform for settlement in central bank money. Alternatively, we could make central bank money available on DLT platforms operated by market stakeholders, allowing both cash and assets to be transferred there. In any event, implications for governance, settlement efficiency and liquidity management need to be carefully assessed. And the suitability of any of these options would depend on which use cases prevail in the market and whether or not the market consolidates around a limited number of DLT platforms. The Eurosystem is committed to providing settlement in central bank money for wholesale transactions through infrastructures that are fit for purpose. Our role is to provide state-of-the-art infrastructures as a basis for private actors to develop their innovative services. These infrastructures can act as a catalyst for innovation within Europe and beyond. We are analysing whether new technologies for settling wholesale transactions could help us continue to play this role effectively. But regardless of the technology used by market participants for their wholesale payments and securities transactions, our goal will always be the same: ensuring that central bank money remains the anchor of stability of the monetary system.","['bank', 'banking', 'currency', 'banks', 'monetary']","['digital euro', 'money eurosystem', 'technology euro', 'euro cash', 'payments digitalisation']","['payment systems eurosystem', 'bank money eurosystem', 'digital technology euro', 'bank digital currencies', 'digital euro project']","['digital euro project', 'digital central bank settlement infrastructures today', 'digital currencies', 'central bank infrastructures', 'euro payments']"
3235,r220926a_ECB,euro area,2022-09-26,Hearing of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament,lagarde,1,"It is a pleasure to be back here in Brussels with you for our third hearing this year. Russia's unjustified war of aggression on Ukraine continues to cast a shadow over Europe. My thoughts are with the Ukrainian people suffering the senseless atrocities of the war. The economic consequences for the euro area have continued to unfold since we last met in June and the outlook is darkening. Inflation remains far too high and is likely to stay above our target for an extended period. At our meeting earlier this month, the Governing Council therefore took the major step to frontload the transition from the prevailing highly accommodative level of policy rates towards levels that will ensure the timely return of inflation to our two per cent medium-term target. In line with the topics chosen for this hearing, I will provide you with a brief overview of the economic outlook and then explain our recent monetary policy decisions in greater detail. The euro area economy grew by 0.8 per cent in the second quarter of 2022, mainly owing to strong consumer spending on services as the economy reopened. Economies with large tourism sectors benefited especially, as people travelled more over the summer. The still robust labour market also continued to support economic activity. Notwithstanding this, we expect activity to slow substantially in the coming quarters. There are four main reasons behind this. First, high inflation is dampening spending and production throughout the economy, and these headwinds are reinforced by gas supply disruptions. Second, the strong demand for services that came with the reopening of the economy is losing steam. Third, the weakening in global demand, also in the context of tighter monetary policy in many major economies, and the worsening terms of trade will mean less support for the euro area economy. Fourth, uncertainty remains high, as reflected in falling household and business confidence. These developments have led to a downward revision of the latest staff projections for economic growth for the remainder of the current year and throughout 2023. Staff now expect the economy to grow by 3.1 per cent in 2022, 0.9 per cent in 2023 and 1.9 per cent in 2024. Inflation rose further to 9.1 per cent in August. Energy and food price inflation remained extremely elevated and were the dominant contributors to overall inflation. Price pressures are spreading across more sectors, in part owing to the impact of high energy costs across the whole economy. Almost half of the items in the inflation basket recorded annual inflation rates above 4 per cent in August and measures of underlying inflation remain high. While supply bottlenecks have been easing, their inflationary impact continues to gradually feed through to consumer prices. Similarly, recovering demand in the services sector is putting upward pressure on prices. The depreciation of the euro has also added to the build-up of inflationary pressures. Looking at the labour market, wage dynamics remain contained so far. However, resilient labour markets and some catch-up to compensate for higher inflation are likely to push up wage growth. Most measures of longer-term inflation expectations currently stand at around two per cent. However, signs of recent above-target revisions to some indicators warrant continued monitoring. The baseline inflation projections of ECB staff have been revised up significantly; annual inflation is now expected to stand at 8.1 per cent in 2022, 5.5 per cent in 2023 and 2.3 per cent in 2024. The risks to the inflation outlook are primarily on the upside, mainly reflecting the possibility of further major disruptions in energy supplies. While these risk factors are the same for growth, their effect would be the opposite: they would increase inflation but reduce growth. Based on the medium-term inflation outlook, the Governing Council decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 75 basis points, on top of the 50 basis point increase announced in July. As things currently stand, we expect to raise interest rates further over the next several meetings to dampen demand and guard against the risk of a persistent upward shift in inflation expectations. We will regularly re-evaluate our policy path in light of incoming information and the evolving inflation outlook. Our future policy rate decisions will continue to be data-dependent and follow a meeting-by-meeting approach. As requested by the Committee, I will now turn briefly to the issue of fragmentation. Since we embarked on our normalisation path in December 2021, we have made clear that we will act should fragmentation risks threaten the even transmission of monetary policy across the euro area. Since 1 July 2022, we have been applying flexibility in reinvesting redemptions coming due in the pandemic emergency purchase programme portfolio, with a view to countering risks to the transmission mechanism related to the pandemic. Later in July, we also announced a new monetary policy tool, the Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI), complementing our existing tools. This tool has been designed to counter unwarranted, disorderly market dynamics, with sufficient flexibility to respond to the severity of the risks facing policy transmission. It will safeguard the singleness of our monetary policy as the Governing Council proceeds on its policy rate normalisation path, helping us ensure price stability over the medium term in line with our mandate. The TPI is subject to a list of eligibility criteria which the Governing Council will use to assess whether a jurisdiction pursues sound and sustainable fiscal and macroeconomic policies. To conclude, inflation continues to rise across the euro area, affecting citizens in all areas of life. The latest Eurobarometer indicates that almost two out of three citizens see rising inflation as one of the two most important issues at the moment. Higher energy and food prices are weighing in particular on the most vulnerable households and the situation is expected to get worse before it gets better. In this environment, it is essential that fiscal support used to shield those households from the impact of higher prices is temporary and targeted. This limits the risk of fuelling inflationary pressures, thereby also facilitating the task of monetary policy to ensure price stability, and contributing to preserving debt sustainability. The best contribution monetary policy can make to the euro area economy is to ensure price stability over the medium term. This means ensuring inflation expectations remain well anchored and that demand conditions are consistent with our target. As I pledged to keep the European Parliament and the general public informed about our progress, let me end by providing you with a brief update on our ongoing work to incorporate climate change considerations into our monetary policy operations. As of next Monday, the Eurosystem will take into account a climate score of issuers in all purchases of corporate bonds, in the context of the Eurosystem's ongoing reinvestment purchases. This will result in the purchase of more bonds issued by companies with a good climate performance and fewer bonds from those with a poor climate performance. These measures will reduce the Eurosystem's exposure to climate-related financial risk, as well as support the green transition of the economy in line with the EU's climate neutrality objectives. As of the first quarter of 2023, we will start publishing climate-related information on our corporate bond holdings, and we will regularly report on the steps we are taking to address climate change within the bounds of our mandate.

I would like to take this chance to express my sincerest gratitude for your cooperation with the activities of the Bank of The last two meetings with business leaders in the Kansai region were held online due to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. I am delighted to meet and exchange views with you in person for the first time in three years. At the outset, I will talk about developments in Japan's economic activity and prices and explain the Bank's thinking on the conduct of monetary policy. Let me start by talking about Japan's economic developments. The repeated waves of COVID-19 at home and abroad have affected Japan's economy through various channels. In the first half of the year, COVID-19 cases surged in China -- which strictly adheres to the so-called zero-COVID policy -- and major cities such as Shanghai went into lockdowns. In the manufacturing industry -- such as automobiles and machine tools, where Japan has a competitive advantage -- firms faced parts procurement difficulties and had to reduce production. Thereafter, the supply-side constraints caused by the lockdown in Shanghai have been dissipating due to the lifting of such restrictions. While parts shortages have remained for some goods, Japan's exports and production overall have continued to increase as a trend, with the effects of supply-side constraints waning (Chart Looking at domestic private consumption, downward pressure from COVID-19 has waned since the lifting of pandemic-related restrictions across Japan in March this year (Chart 2). During the summer, Japan experienced a seventh wave of COVID-19 and the number of confirmed cases significantly surpassed its previous peak. However, the number of people visiting downtown areas, such as around Osaka and Namba stations, has almost returned to the pre-pandemic level, albeit with fluctuations. The fact that a procession of the yamahoko floats was held for the first time in three years during Kyoto's Gion Festival also seems to represent a change in the situation. Although the impact of COVID-19 has not disappeared, of course, sales for retail and dining-out, for example, suggest that private consumption has increased moderately. Meanwhile, crude oil and other international commodity prices have risen significantly, reflecting heightened geopolitical risks, such as the situation surrounding Ukraine, and a recovery in global demand. Since Japan relies on imports for most of its raw materials, including natural resources and grains, those rises put downward pressure on the economy by bringing about an outflow of income from Japan. Despite being affected by such commodity price rises and other factors, Japan's economy has picked up as the resumption of economic activity has progressed while public health has been protected. Regarding the outlook, it seems highly likely that the economy will continue recovering, considering the following three factors. The first is improvement in exports, production, and business fixed investment. Exports and production are likely to continue on an uptrend, as order backlogs have accumulated and as supply-side constraints, which have put downward pressure on them, are expected to wane. Business fixed investment is projected to be supported by high levels of corporate profits and by implementation of projects that have been postponed due to the impact of long-term issues, such as digitalization, decarbonization, and restructuring of supply chains, is also expected to take place. In fact, business fixed investment plans for fiscal 2022 indicate that investment is expected to increase at a higher rate than usual. The second factor is solid private consumption. The recent rise in prices is an element that could push down consumption by reducing households' real purchasing power. That said, consumption is expected to keep increasing for the time being, supported by the materialization of demand that has been suppressed during the pandemic, such as for travel and dining-out, and by savings that have accumulated to date (Chart 4). It should be noted, however, that such demand -- or pent-up demand -- has only temporary effects by its nature. Whether private consumption will see a sustained increase even after pent-up demand runs out depends on a rise in household income, especially wage increases. I will return to this crucial point later. The third factor is that, with the government relaxing entry restrictions, inbound tourism demand is expected to recover. In particular, potential demand for such tourism seems to be rising in areas with abundant tourism resources, such as the Kansai region. Having mentioned positive factors regarding Japan's economy, I would also like to note that there are ever-increasing uncertainties about the future, especially downside risks to the outlook. as mentioned earlier, COVID-19 cases surged at an unprecedented pace during the seventh wave of the pandemic. It can be argued that the negative impact on the economy has been limited despite the large number of cases, as the resumption of economic activity has progressed while public health has been protected. That said, there seems to be a cautious stance toward consumption activity -- especially among seniors, who are considered to be at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. It cannot be ruled out that waves of COVID-19 will recur, and, depending on the consequences of the resurgence, the extent and timing of the materialization of pent-up demand will be impacted. In addition, if COVID-19 resurges in regions that are linked to Japanese firms' supply chains, such as China, attention is warranted on the possibility that supply-side constraints will intensify again. The second risk factor is developments in overseas economic activity and prices (Chart 6). Inflation rates have risen around the world recently. Those in the United States and the euro area have been close to double digits, marking the highest levels in about 40 years. In response, overseas central banks have raised interest rates. In the United States, a mismatch in the labor market has widened: labor demand has increased rapidly, as seen in the significant rise in the number of job openings as the economy reopened, while labor supply has been slow to recover, mainly for seniors and women, due, for example, to their concern over COVID-19 (Chart 7). Wage growth has been high, registering over 5 percent, and higher labor costs have intensified inflationary pressure. In this situation, services prices, which are susceptible to labor costs, have risen further. The Federal Reserve is increasingly concerned about the so-called wage-price spiral, where such upward pressure on wages accelerates inflationary pressure and vice versa. To contain inflation, it has already raised the target range for the federal funds rate five times for a total of 3 percentage points since the turn of the year, with a view to suppressing In the euro area, the inflation rate has risen to roughly the same level as in the United States, but for different reasons. The main cause of inflation has been cost-push factors, such as surging energy prices, and demand has not been that strong. However, the European Central Bank is concerned about a risk that significantly high inflation will push up people's inflation expectations and consequently lead to runaway inflation through firms' higher wage setting. Therefore, it regards containing inflation as the priority task and has been rapidly lifting interest rates even at the risk of adversely affecting the economy to some extent. Central banks in other advanced economies, such as the United Kingdom, and in emerging economies have also raised interest rates. While these measures are necessary to contain inflation, they may eventually trigger a further slowdown in the global economy. There are numerous other risks surrounding overseas economies. Europe, which has been affected by high inflation and interest rate hikes, faces a risk that constraints on energy supplies will intensify. Adjustments in the Chinese real estate market also are a source of concern. show that the projected growth rate for 2022 has been revised sharply downward since autumn last year (Chart 8). Nevertheless, in the July update, the IMF maintained the baseline scenario that the global economy will achieve a soft landing, as suggested by the projected overall growth rate of around 3 percent. However, attention should be paid to the fact that risks are skewed to the downside, as I have just explained, including the extent of economic deceleration due to interest rate hikes around the world. I will now turn to price developments in Japan. The impact of global inflation has spilled over to Japan. Looking at the figures for the domestic consumer price index (CPI) for August released last week, the year-on-year rate of change for all items excluding fresh food was 2.8 percent (Chart 9). The rate is likely to increase further toward the end of the year, but as the contribution of elevated costs peaks out from the beginning of 2023, it is projected to decline to below 2 percent. The reasons behind this projection are as follows. The major contributors to the recent price rises are items for which price developments are susceptible to an increase in international raw material prices, such as energy-related items -- including gasoline prices and electricity charges -- and food products. In addition, while prices have also risen recently for durable goods, including household electrical appliances, and services such as dining-out and those related to housing repairs and maintenance, these hikes also are mainly attributed to the nondomestic factor of price rises in raw materials. Current price rises in Japan therefore are more likely to be the result of high costs that mainly stem from high commodity prices and the yen's depreciation, rather than an increase in domestic demand. Unless international commodity prices continue to rise in the future, such upward pressure from high costs on prices is projected to gradually decrease from the beginning of 2023. Underlying inflation, which is developments in inflation in the absence of such cost-push factors from abroad, is determined by two factors: the output gap, which shows the level of economic activity, and people's inflation expectations. Japan's output gap has been in negative territory. However, with the economy following a growth path that outpaces its potential growth rate, the gap is projected to turn positive in the second half of fiscal 2022 and then continue to expand moderately. Regarding inflation expectations, not only short-term but also long-term ones have risen, with the rate of inflation accelerating recently (Chart 10). Considering these developments in the output gap and inflation expectations -- although whether they will continue requires careful monitoring -- underlying inflation is likely to rise moderately. That said, as mentioned earlier, because the contribution of elevated costs is likely to peak out from the beginning of 2023, the CPI inflation rate is projected to decline to below 2 percent from fiscal 2023. This view is shared by the IMF Next, I will explain the Bank's thinking on its conduct of monetary policy. Since the introduction of quantitative and qualitative monetary easing (QQE) in 2013, the Bank's aim of conducting monetary policy has been consistent -- that is, to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent in a sustainable and stable manner. What the Bank aims for is the formation of a virtuous cycle in which prices rise moderately amid a situation where economic activity improves, wages rise, and corporate profits increase. On this point, a look at wage developments shows that summer bonuses this year increased at high rates on the back of high corporate profits (Chart 12). Minimum wages have been raised by record amounts. Looking ahead, in the services industry, which has been affected by the pandemic, pent-up demand is likely to materialize for travel and dining-out as the impact of COVID-19 subsides and inbound tourism demand is projected to recover. As this industry faced labor shortages before the pandemic, if labor market conditions tighten due to such a rise in demand, wages are expected to increase, mainly for non-regular employees. In addition, exports, production, and business fixed investment -- all of which have been pushed down by supply-side constraints -- are projected to recover as those constraints wane. This is likely to lead to improvement in labor market conditions and wages, such as in the manufacturing industry. As the environment gradually becomes favorable for wage hikes, the recent price rises are expected to be reflected in wage negotiations. The Bank will continue with monetary easing so as to firmly support Japan's economy from the demand side and thereby encourage the formation of the virtuous cycle accompanied by wage increases. At the Monetary Policy Meeting held last week, the Bank decided to phase out the Special shift to fund-provisioning that would meet a wide range of financing needs. The Bank introduced the Special Operations to Facilitate Financing as a temporary measure following the outbreak of COVID-19 in spring 2020, and thereafter has extended the implementation period while making partial revisions to them depending on financial conditions. The operations at first were to support financing of not only small and medium-sized firms but also large firms, but they have been targeted at supporting mainly small and medium-sized firms since April 2022. Regarding the details on the decisions, the Bank extended the implementation period of the Special Operations to Facilitate Financing by six months for the fund-provisioning against loans for which financial institutions bear credit risk (""non-government-supported loans"") and decided to complete the fund-provisioning at the end of March 2023. The period was extended by three months for the fund-provisioning against loans that financial institutions make on the back of government support (""government-supported loans""). Firms' financing needs arise not only from the impact of COVID-19 but also for various reasons, such as an increase in working capital due, for example, to higher raw material prices. From the viewpoint of meeting such a wide range of financing needs, the Bank decided that fund-provisioning under the Funds-Supplying Operations against Pooled Collateral, which previously had been limited to a bi-weekly basis and up to a maximum of 2 trillion yen, will be conducted without an upper limit. These operations are the most versatile among the Bank's various market operations, as it accepts various types of collateral for them. Japan's financial conditions have been accommodative on the whole (Chart 13). Although the impact of COVID-19 has remained in some segments of small and medium-sized firms in particular, financial positions, including of these firms, have been on an improving trend. firmly maintain accommodative financial conditions for businesses by shifting its focus to meet a wide range of financing needs while gradually scaling back the role of acute crisis measures, such as the Special Operations to Facilitate Financing, depending on the circumstances. Today, I have talked about developments in Japan's economic activity and prices and about the Bank's conduct of monetary policy. As we successively face various risks, such as the pandemic and heightened geopolitical risks, Japan's economic society as a whole needs to flexibly respond to them and take this opportunity to grow. Specifically, in a society where the population is declining, the urgent issue is ""investment in people"" -- which includes increasing wages, supporting upskilling, and promoting diverse working styles -- as well as improvement in productivity through, for example, digital transformation. Although I do not have time to go into detail today, it is also necessary to address climate change, which is a social issue that should be considered from a longer-term perspective. Needless to say, the driver of medium- to long-term economic growth is the private sector's various efforts toward improving growth potential. The Bank will continue to firmly support your efforts from the financial side by maintaining a favorable macroeconomic environment. Thank you very much for your attention.","['yen', 'monetary', 'japan', 'economy', 'inflation']","['japan economy', 'japan economic', 'japan financial', 'regarding japan', 'demand japan']","['regarding japan economy', 'risks japan economic', 'affected japan economy', 'japan economic developments', 'developments japan economic']","['japanese firms', 'monetary policy', 'monetary policy meeting', 'overseas economies', 'yen']"

Please address any comments or enquiries to: The PRA's consultation process expectations of firms when managing the key prudential risks associated with asset encumbrance, specifically in the contexts of managing liquidity and funding risks, recovery planning, and resolution. The PRA's proposed expectations relate both to firms' internal monitoring and management of these risks, and to the information that firms are expected to provide to the PRA through their periodic recovery plans. This CP is relevant to all PRA-authorised firms, except credit unions and insurance firms. The proposals relate to expectations on firms' compliance with specific aspects of existing PRA Resolution Pack Parts of the PRA Rulebook. The PRA would give effect to the expectations proposed in this CP by way of amendments to the following Supervisory Statements: and For the purposes of this consultation, encumbered assets should be understood as those which are pledged or otherwise committed to counterparties to secure, collateralise or credit-enhance a transaction, such that the assets cannot be freely transferred, withdrawn, liquidated, sold or disposed. The counterparties to which the assets are pledged, such as secured creditors, have prior claim on encumbered assets in the event of insolvency. Firms can encumber assets whether they are recorded on- or off-balance sheet. In some circumstances, any residual value from overcollateralisation may not be released to other creditors for a long time period. Firms encumber assets in a variety of circumstances, including when offering collateral to the Bank of England (Bank) in its role as central bank. The Bank offers liquidity insurance facilities that allow eligible firms to borrow cash (in the form of reserves) or to swap illiquid assets for more liquid ones (known as a collateral 'upgrade'). The Bank operates a range of published facilities that do this, Secured funding can increase the diversity of firms' funding sources, and acts as a resilient source of financing in stressed conditions when investors demand greater security. Therefore, secured funding has a key role to play in the stability of firms' funding, and the PRA does not consider asset encumbrance to be undesirable of itself. A certain amount of encumbrance in normal times can also reduce firms' funding costs and make it more likely that they will be able to scale up their secured funding in stress: they already have the systems, expertise and policies in place to be active in those markets. But elevated asset encumbrance in normal times can pose certain prudential risks. The PRA proposes that it is essential that firms consider these risks appropriately, that they articulate tolerances for them and monitor them through clearly defined metrics, and that they set limits where appropriate. In this CP, the PRA proposes to clarify its expectation that firms demonstrate that they have considered these factors appropriately, for example in the ILAAP document, the recovery plan and, for applicable firms, as part of their assessments of their preparations for resolution. As well as the publication of this CP, the PRA also plans to enhance its monitoring of firms' asset encumbrance levels and the amounts of liquidity that they might be able to generate from unencumbered assets in a stress, in response to the report following HM Treasury's 'Independent review of the prudential supervision of The Co-Operative Bank Plc'. In particular, this monitoring will draw on information held by the PRA and the Bank, including regulatory returns such as the PRA expects that this work will assist the PRA in identifying potential concerns relating to firms' levels of asset encumbrance and to the amounts of liquidity which firms would be able to generate in stress. It will also assist in identifying firms which appear to be particularly susceptible to risks associated with excessive asset encumbrance, and those whose levels of asset encumbrance appear to be high given factors such as their business and funding models. Firms will differ significantly in terms of the proportion of their assets which are encumbered in normal times, the types of assets which are encumbered, the means by which they are encumbered, and the counterparties to whom they are encumbered. Therefore, the PRA does not envisage a 'onesize-fits-all' approach. The risks will depend in part on firms' business and funding models, and on other factors such as their capital adequacy. Firms whose business is primarily focused on the UK residential mortgage market, for example, are likely to have a less diverse pool of assets to encumber as needed than firms with a more diverse balance sheet. Firms whose funding comprises a larger proportion of wholesale unsecured funding will be more vulnerable to the risks arising from the structural subordination of their unsecured creditors in the creditor hierarchy. Firms with smaller buffers to minimum capital requirements may be more vulnerable to a deterioration in market perception arising from increasing asset encumbrance. The PRA expects firms to consider appropriately how risks associated with asset encumbrance are relevant to them, with specific reference to these and other factors. With the proposals in this CP, the PRA aims to support firms in demonstrating a consistently high standard of risk management practices, including through their periodic submissions to the PRA (eg in their ILAAP documents and recovery plans). The policy proposals included in this CP involve amendments to existing SSs to make clear that: firms should consider appropriately and thoroughly the potential impacts that asset encumbrance can have on their funding profiles, and put in place adequate risk management processes which include monitoring key metrics at appropriate committees, with clearly defined accountability for risk management, setting limits where appropriate; firms should document the above adequately in their ILAAP documents; building societies should manage their asset encumbrance in line with the PRA's existing expectations and proposed expectations set out in SS20/15, as well as with the PRA's firms should consider appropriately the effects that increased asset encumbrance might have on their abilities to maintain or restore their financial viability during a variety of stress scenarios; and firms should ensure that their levels of asset encumbrance do not unduly impair the amount and cash value of the assets which could be lent against in resolution, including by the Bank within its usual risk tolerance. This consultation closes on Friday 17 January 2020. The PRA invites feedback on the proposals set out in this consultation. Please send any comments or enquiries to . The PRA will keep its proposed approach and policy under review to assess whether any adjustments are required, including in light of the planned introduction of the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) standard. In particular, the PRA will monitor the quality of information provided by firms in their ILAAP documents, recovery plans and, for applicable firms, as part of their assessments of their preparations for resolution, to ensure it is sufficient to meet the expectations set out in these proposals. The proposals set out in this CP have been designed in the context of the current UK and EU regulatory framework. In the event that the UK leaves the EU with no implementation period in place, the PRA has assessed that the proposals would not need to be amended under the EU for further details. The draft amendments to SSs attached to this CP should also be read in conjunction with SS1/19 'Non-binding PRA materials: The PRA's approach after the UK's withdrawal from the EU'. The following section sets out the PRA's proposed expectations of firms' management of the risks associated with asset encumbrance. The relevant areas are: Stability of funding. Recovery planning. This section summarises the PRA's view of how risks associated with asset encumbrance may affect the stability of firms' funding profiles, and sets out the PRA's proposal for how firms should manage those risks. The PRA considers asset encumbrance to be relevant to the requirement that firms ensure that they maintain a prudent funding profile, and that they act in a prudent manner and maintain adequate financial resources. A firm's funding stability refers to its ability to retain and roll over or renew its funding under both normal and stressed conditions. The stability of a firm's funding profile depends on the behavioural stability of its deposits, the maturity profile and behavioural stability of its other funding sources, and its ability to continue to access wholesale funding markets in stressed market conditions. Secured funding increases banks' funding diversity and acts as a resilient source of funding in stressed conditions when investors demand greater security. Secured funding therefore has a key role to play in the stability of banks' funding. But the PRA considers that excessive asset encumbrance in normal times may affect negatively the stability of a firm's funding profile. As a firm encumbers a higher proportion of its available assets in normal times, it will have less capacity remaining should a stress occur to encumber additional assets in order to raise cash to meet its obligations. This makes the firm less resilient to stress, which may cause creditors to charge higher spreads or respond more quickly to signs of stress. Therefore higher levels of asset encumbrance in normal times can negatively affect funding stability by making a firm less resilient to stress. As the market's confidence in a firm diminishes, for example in a stress, creditors and counterparties may seek to apply larger haircuts on collateral and make margin calls. High levels of encumbrance may therefore give rise to an adverse feedback loop which could lead to yet higher encumbrance, diminishing the firm's capacity to generate additional liquidity even further. This risk may be particularly acute in certain arrangements, such as some derivative positions, where changes in the amount of collateral which the firm must provide are volatile and depend on a number of variables. Secured creditors have prior claim on encumbered assets in the event of the borrower's insolvency. Encumbrance therefore subordinates other, unsecured creditors in the creditor hierarchy, which may increase their losses in the event of the firm's default. Consequently, unsecured creditors may react more quickly to signs of stress in firms with higher levels of encumbrance. This is an additional channel through which asset encumbrance can negatively affect funding stability. The PRA proposes that firms would be expected to consider appropriately and thoroughly the potential impacts that asset encumbrance can have on the stability of their funding profiles. These impacts include, but are not necessarily limited to, the issues described above. As such, firms would be expected to consider how low levels of good quality unencumbered assets may reduce their capacity to withstand a funding stress. They would be expected to consider the impacts that this may have on market perceptions and therefore on the cost and stability of their funding sources. This would include the propensity of their deposits to run in stress, and the risk that the firm would need to encumber additional assets in stress to meet the demand for increased haircuts and margin calls. The PRA proposes that, as part of this, firms would ensure that they are able to measure and monitor the amounts and sources of encumbrance, and the likely liquidity value of assets that are unencumbered. The PRA also proposes that firms would be expected to define their tolerance of those risks through clearly defined metrics that are monitored regularly, using good quality and timely data, at appropriate forums (eg board risk committees). Where appropriate, boards and risk functions would be expected to set limits which constrain the business to ensure that risks associated with asset encumbrance are kept within tolerance. The PRA acknowledges that there are currently a number of specific expectations for building societies in relation to asset encumbrance set out in SS20/15. The PRA proposes that its expectations for building societies should be brought into line with those of other firms. As such, the PRA is consulting on a number of amendments to SS20/15 to bring it in line with the expectations that the SS20/15 sets out the PRA's expectations that societies set a board-level limit on market encumbrance, excluding central bank funding and asset swaps. The PRA proposes that societies would be expected to set limits as they consider appropriate for all kinds of encumbrance, including encumbrance with central banks. The PRA proposes to include in its expectations of societies using the 'administered approach' that they should set board-approved limits on their funding from, and encumbrance with, central banks (recognising that the PRA does not expect those societies to have access to wholesale funding from other sources). Societies using the 'matched' approach would set board-approved internal limits on asset encumbrance, and would set sub-limits by type of exposure as appropriate. Regarding the PRA's expectations of societies using the 'extended approach', the PRA currently expects that those societies set a limit on encumbrance to counterparties other than central banks which does not normally exceed 20% of total assets. The PRA expects that societies treat the suggested limits in SS20/15 as indicative only. It is for each society to determine its own individual approach, based on its specific risk appetite, corporate plan and risk management capabilities. The 'extensions' arrangements set out in Chapter 5 of SS20/15 apply in the normal way to setting limits on asset encumbrance. The PRA proposes that societies also set limits on total encumbrance (including to central banks). Namely, the PRA proposes to make clear that societies should not count encumbrance twice if they receive government bonds from a central bank in exchange for collateral, and then re-hypothecate those bonds for cash by way of a repurchase agreement ('repo'). The PRA considers that this is already the meaning of the paragraph, but that minor redrafting would make the point clearer for firms. This section summarises the PRA's proposed expectations of how firms should consider asset encumbrance for the purpose of their recovery planning. The PRA already requires firms to undertake recovery planning so that they are ready for periods of financial stress, can stabilise their financial position and can recover from financial losses. The PRA also currently expects firms to: have a number of recovery options, and maintain and test their plans; and ensure they have sufficient credible options to restore their capital and liquidity positions to appropriate levels in, or following, a stress. It is important that firms are aware of the total liquidity they could credibly generate in a range of stresses if they needed to do so, and that they demonstrate to the PRA that there is sufficient recovery capacity to maintain or restore their financial viability. Firms may seek to encumber assets for part of this capacity. This liquidity may be raised from central banks (eg through the Bank's sterling liquidity facilities) and/or the private market. Where encumbrance forms part of a firm's recovery strategy, the PRA considers that a necessary part of this assessment is determining what assets could be pledged to secure funding, how much liquidity could be raised by doing so, and over what period. The PRA proposes that firms consider at least the following factors in making that assessment: Firms' assessments are sensitive to the specific characteristics of the stress scenarios they employ (for example, the amount of funding which can be secured against a given pool of UK residential mortgage assets may be significantly reduced if the stress scenario in question affects, in particular, the UK housing market). As stated in SS9/17, those stress scenarios should be relevant to the firm's business model and be sufficiently severe to test the plan. Firms consider the possible effect of elevated asset encumbrance during stress on the availability, cost and stability of its other sources of funding, such as in the wholesale unsecured market. Firms articulate how the evolving profile of asset encumbrance compares against their tolerance for the risks that encumbrance poses in normal times. Given these, firms are able to articulate the profile of key asset encumbrance metrics throughout each scenario in the plan. Firms identify how they plan to return their levels of asset encumbrance to within appetite following the stress. They consider how the evolving profile of asset encumbrance can affect their recovery strategy (eg cost of issuing new capital) in a scenario where the firm is aiming to restore both its liquidity and capital position. recovery plan, and (where applicable) concurrent stress testing documents to be consistent with each other. As such, the analysis on asset encumbrance in a firm's recovery plan should be consistent, where relevant, with that in its ILAAP and ICAAP. The Bank as UK resolution authority is responsible for taking action to manage the failure of financial firms in the UK. This includes developing strategies in normal times to resolve individual firms in the event of their failure, and assessing and removing potential barriers to resolution. The PRA works with the Bank in its resolution capacity to ensure that any PRA-regulated firms that fail do so in an orderly manner. This derives from the PRA's statutory obligation to advance its general objective - to promote the safety and soundness of the firms it regulates - in part by seeking to minimise the adverse effect that the failure of one of those firms could be expected to have on the stability of the UK financial system. One potential barrier to resolution is inadequate financial resources, which includes inadequate access to liquidity to continue to meet obligations as they fall due throughout a resolution. The amount and nature of a firm's available (unencumbered) assets at the point of entry into resolution clearly affects how much liquidity it could raise if needed. To facilitate developing each firm's resolution strategy, the Bank conducts a regular resolvability assessment. As part of this, the Bank considers, among other things, whether limited access to liquid resources during resolution might present a barrier to an effective resolution. The Bank expects to see that firms can estimate, anticipate and monitor their potential liquidity resources and needs, and to be able to model their liquidity needs in the approach to, and throughout, a resolution. requires firms with retail deposits equal to or greater than PS50 billion on an individual or consolidated basis to assess their preparations for resolution, and to submit a report of their assessment to the PRA every two years starting by Friday 2 October 2020. As part of this assessment, the PRA expects firms to assess whether they have the capabilities, resources and arrangements to ensure that they have adequate funding to meet obligations as they fall due. Firms should identify any risks which could prevent this outcome from being achieved and detail the steps they intend to take to reduce or remove those risks. The PRA considers that one such potential risk is that a firm's asset encumbrance profile in normal times unduly impairs the amount and cash value of the assets which the firm could encumber with market counterparties, or the Bank within its usual risk tolerance, to allow for the effective implementation of the firm's resolution strategy. The PRA has a statutory duty to consult when introducing new rules and, when not making rules, has a public law duty to consult widely where it would be fair to do so. When doing so, the PRA provides the following in relation to the proposed policy: a cost benefit analysis; an explanation of the PRA's reasons for believing that making the proposed policy is compatible with the PRA's duty to act in a way that advances its general objective, insurance objective (if applicable), and secondary competition objective; an explanation of the PRA's reasons for believing that making the proposed policy is compatible with its duty to have regard to the regulatory principles; and a statement as to whether the impact of the proposed rules will be significantly different to mutuals than to other persons. economic policy as recommended by HM Treasury. The PRA is also required by the Equality Act 2010 to have due regard to the need to eliminate discrimination and to promote equality of opportunity in carrying out its policies, services and functions. The proposals contained in this CP fall into three categories: (i) expectations of firms to develop adequate frameworks, processes and accountabilities to manage the risks associated with asset encumbrance; (ii) expectations of firms to take steps to ensure that the risks associated with asset encumbrance remain within an appropriately defined appetite; and (iii) expectations of firms to demonstrate the adequacy of their frameworks, processes and accountabilities to the PRA through regulatory submissions and continuous assessment. The PRA already requires firms to 'act in a prudent manner and maintain adequate financial resources'. In addition, firms must already put in place risk management policies that define their approach to asset encumbrance, as well as procedures and controls that ensure that the risks associated with collateral management and asset encumbrance are adequately identified, monitored and managed. Firms must already ensure that their liquidity risk and funding risk appetites are appropriate for their business strategies and reflect their financial conditions and funding capacities. Firms must already produce timely information for their management bodies on, among other things, the amount, expected level and credit quality of unencumbered assets that are capable of being encumbered, specifying the volume of assets available for encumbrance and the expected amount, level and types of additional encumbrance that may result from stress. The proposed expectations set out in this consultation only expand on specific aspects of the existing rules above; they do not create any new rules. The PRA believes that firms do not all currently meet all expectations proposed in this consultation. Following this consultation (and upon publication of the Policy Statement with finalised expectations), the PRA expects that some firms will need to incur some cost to design and implement adequate risk management frameworks, policies and accountabilities. The PRA expects this cost to be limited, especially for firms whose business and funding models give rise to fewer and less significant risks associated with asset encumbrance, and for firms which already demonstrate better risk management practices. The PRA already requires firms to 'act in a prudent manner and maintain adequate financial resources'. The PRA also already requires that firms' liquidity resources must remain 'adequate, both as to amount and quality' to ensure that there is no significant risk that the firm's liabilities cannot be met as they fall due. Firms must maintain a 'prudent funding profile'. As above, the proposed expectations set out in this consultation only expand on specific aspects of the existing rules above; they do not create any new rules. If a firm meets the expectations proposed in this consultation, as well as the broader framework of rules and expectations currently in place, and then determines that some risks associated with asset encumbrance are beyond its appropriately-defined appetite, then the PRA would expect the firm to return those risks to within appetite over a reasonable timeframe, as part of the PRA's requirement that firms act in a prudent manner. Firms might do this by changing their approach to asset encumbrance (eg by reducing the amount of encumbrance or the assets encumbered), or by otherwise mitigating the risks that are associated with asset encumbrance. The PRA expects that either action will incur some cost. The extent of this cost will depend on the size of the firm, the complexity of its funding profile, and the extent to which it is outside of its appetite for risks associated with asset encumbrance. But the PRA considers that any additional cost would be exceeded by the benefits of the firm having brought prudential risks to within its own appetite. The PRA expects that this will make the firm more resilient to stress and have a more stable funding profile. The PRA already requires firms to produce ILAAP documents which contain firms' assessments of the adequacy of their liquidity and funding. The PRA will assess whether a firm, in its ILAAP document, has adequately identified its liquidity needs across appropriate time horizons in severe but plausible stresses for all relevant risk drivers and whether its liquidity resources are adequate to meet those needs. The PRA also already requires firms to draw up and maintain a recovery plan providing for measures to be taken by firms to restore their financial positions following a significant deterioration of their financial situations. Firms must already submit their recovery plans to the The PRA already requires that in-scope firms prepare and maintain a resolution pack, and provide it to the PRA. As above, the expectations set out in this consultation only expand on specific aspects of the existing rules above; they do not create any new rules. The PRA believes that not all firms currently meet all expectations proposed in this consultation. Following this consultation (and upon publication of the Policy Statement with finalised expectations) some firms will incur some limited costs to ensure that the risk management policies, frameworks and accountabilities set out above are documented adequately in the submissions that firms make to the PRA. This cost will be higher for firms whose risk management policies, frameworks and accountabilities are particularly extensive or complex. Overall, the cost of firms becoming compliant with our proposed expectations should be low, but non-zero. The PRA expects that a handful of firms will incur higher costs as they take action to bring the risks associated with their levels of asset encumbrance to within their appetite. The PRA expects that most other firms will need to take some action to enhance their risk management processes, and to document them in their regulatory submissions to the PRA, as a result of these proposed expectations. The PRA considers that the likely costs of these actions will be exceeded by the likely benefits for all firms. The expectations that the PRA proposes in this CP relate to what the PRA considers to be an essential component of the prudent management of firms' funding profiles, and so too of financial stability. The cost of failing to manage adequately the risks associated with asset encumbrance is likely to be high in a stress, for firms for which the risks are most severe. By meeting the expectations proposed in this CP, firms should be more resilient to stress, and also therefore better able to manage their funding profiles in normal times. 3.14 As noted, the PRA has a statutory objective to promote the safety and soundness of banks, building societies, credit unions, insurers and PRA-designated investment firms. The PRA intends for the proposals in this CP to further that objective by ensuring that the PRA has an appropriate framework to ensure that risks associated with asset encumbrance are managed appropriately, and to improve the PRA's supervision of firms' encumbering their assets and managing associated risks. 3.15 Asset encumbrance can impact negatively the stability of a firm's funding profile by reducing its financial resilience and by subordinating unsecured creditors. The more assets a firm encumbers, the less it has available to encumber in order to raise the liquidity resources it needs in a stress, including as part of the effective execution of its recovery plan. Encumbrance also limits the assets that might be available as collateral to the Bank to lend against within its usual risk tolerance in the event of the firm's resolution. Asset encumbrance and the risks associated with it can therefore affect the safety and soundness of PRA-regulated firms both directly (for firms who encumber their assets) and indirectly (for other firms operating in a financial system where high levels of encumbrance are present). 3.16 The proposed framework expects firms to consider appropriately the risks associated with asset encumbrance and to manage them effectively through clearly-defined processes and accountabilities. It expects firms to take steps to ensure that asset encumbrance does not unduly impair the amount of assets that could be available to the firm to encumber in a stress, or available to the Bank to lend against within its usual risk tolerance in the event of the firm's resolution. The proposed framework expects firms to document adequately these risk-management practices in the information they submit to the PRA, such as ILAAP documents and recovery plans. This would allow the PRA to identify good and bad practices, provide feedback to firms, and challenge them when they fall short of expectations. The PRA expects that all of the above contribute to the safety and soundness of firms. 3.17 When discharging its general function in a way that advances its primary objectives, the PRA has, as a secondary objective, a duty to facilitate effective competition in the markets for services provided by PRA-authorised persons. The proposals in this consultation have no adverse impact on the PRA's secondary objective. They are designed not to propose a 'one-size-fits-all' approach, but rather to ask firms to determine for themselves the prevalence and severity of risks associated with asset encumbrance, to define for themselves what their tolerance for those risks are, and to take the necessary action to bring the risks within tolerance where necessary. As such, the proposed expectations are proportionate and accommodate a broad diversity of business models, sizes and complexities. In developing the proposals in this CP, the PRA has had regard to the regulatory principles. Three of the principles are particularly relevant: The principle that a burden or restriction which is imposed on a person should be proportionate to the benefits, which are expected to result from the imposition of that burd","['consultation', 'confidentiality', 'disclosure', 'documents', 'information']","['response consultation', 'responding consultation', 'consultation following', 'consultation provide', 'following consultation']","['provided response consultation', 'response consultation including', 'responding consultation provide', 'consultation provide personal', 'response consultation paper']","['consultation', 'consultation paper', 'personal information', 'personal data', 'consultation process expectations']"
7677,r220928a_FOMC,united states,2022-09-28,The New Landscape for Banking Competition,bowman,0,"Good morning and thank you, Jim, it's great to be back here in St. Louis for this year's research conference. While the Federal Reserve learned a lot about how to operate virtually during these past two-and-a-half years of the pandemic, there are certain interactions and discussions that are just better face to face. For me, this conference is one of them. It's also significant that we're able to be here in person to commemorate the 10th year of these proceedings. I'd like to share a few thoughts on how we got here. Back in 2013, in the wake of the financial crisis and the passage of the Dodd- understanding that research plays a vital role in shaping our nation's supervisory and regulatory policy. Simply put, good research leads to good policy, and the decision was made to create a conference that could attract high-caliber research on community banking from all over the world. The conference was also designed to be a forum for multiple stakeholders-- researchers, policymakers, and community bankers--to come together annually to share insights and perspectives, all in the interest of better informing current and future research. In my view, this gathering has certainly delivered on, and expanded upon, these promises. Sadly, two of the pioneers of this conference are no longer with us to celebrate this important 10-year milestone: John Ryan, president and CEO of the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, and Rich Brown, chief economist at the FDIC, both have passed away since the last time we were able to be here together in person. John created the  vision for this conference and oversaw its success to this point, while Rich served for many years on the conference research committee, and even served as an academic discussant. Both have shaped this conference in important ways, and both will be deeply missed. In 2014, CSBS, under John Ryan's leadership, identified a need for more forward-looking data and information on community banks and the banking industry. This led to the creation of the CSBS National Survey of Community Banks. The survey gathered data and insights that were previously unavailable on this scale directly from community bankers. As a former state bank commissioner, I know how much effort community banks put in each year to provide accurate and detailed responses to the survey. We have all benefitted from and appreciate the insights they share. The survey has enhanced our understanding of how much the banking industry has changed. It has also provided data that have been used in academic research, policy papers, and official government reports. Among its many contributions, the survey provides data on the costs of regulatory compliance and trend data on products and services being offered, and in some cases, discontinued, by community banks. The CSBS survey also shows how competition has changed community banking in recent years. It is this topic of competition that I will focus on for the remainder of my remarks today. One of the more interesting findings from the CSBS survey has been how community banks have reported changes in competition for both deposits and loans. Although the majority of community banks report that other community banks are still their primary competitors, that majority has steadily declined in each year of the survey  as credit unions and larger banks have become the dominant competitors for deposits in an increasing number of markets. The situation is even more interesting for loan competition. Each year, a larger percentage of community banks report fintech firms as their primary competitors for consumer loans, the Farm Credit System as their primary competitor for agricultural loans, and nonbanks as their primary competitor for mortgage loans. While not necessarily surprising, these and other data underscore that there is a new and evolving competitive landscape for banking services in the United States. As the nature of competition changes, it creates an opportunity for us to rethink how we evaluate bank mergers, how we define banking markets, and how we develop a more comprehensive understanding of the ways consumers and businesses access financial products and services today and how they might do so in the future. So how has the competitive landscape for banking services changed in the United One of the most obvious changes has been in the number of commercial bank charters. In just 10 years, the number of bank charters has declined by approximately 20 percent. At the end of 2012, there were about 5,900 commercial banks in the United States. The current number of charters today stands at just below 4,800. This decline in charters has been concentrated among banks with less than $250 million in total assets. Up until 2009, the number of bank branches increased, despite the decline in the number of bank charters. However, since the 2009 financial crisis, the number of branches has declined each year. This decline was particularly pronounced during the  pandemic when, between 2020 and 2021, the number of bank branches declined by almost 4 percent as more than 3,200 branches were closed. Before discussing how declines in bank charters and bank branches influence how we think about the competitive impact of mergers in certain markets, it should be noted that how we measure competition today largely springs from a 1963 Supreme Court decision where the court held that the relevant product market for the purposes of analyzing a bank merger is the ""cluster of products . . . and services"" that constitute ""commercial banking"" in each banking market. This means that to evaluate banking competition, we essentially require two key inputs: The geographical definition of the banking market, and An understanding of the bank products and services that are provided to most households and small businesses by the banks in those markets. The geographic definition of banking markets is a Federal Reserve responsibility, and the Fed has currently defined more than 1,400 banking markets nationwide. This geographic definition requires constant analysis and regular updating. One only needs to think of how the growth of the suburbs has increased the distances residents are willing to travel for their jobs and other important services, including banking services, to appreciate how banking markets have changed and will continue to change. As communities change, so do their banking markets. The second part of this evaluation is more daunting because there is currently no way to comprehensively measure the full ""cluster"" of commercial banking products and services in a given market. This challenge is compounded by the fact that the products  and services banks offer also frequently change to meet evolving customer and business demand. Historically, we've used a bank's share of deposits in a market as a proxy for market power for the broader cluster of commercial banking products and services. The idea is that both consumers and small businesses often access commercial banking products through their deposit relationship institution. This approach also has the advantage of being measurable since banks are required to report deposits at the branch To better reflect competition from thrift institutions, for many years the calculation of local deposit and market share data has also included a weighted consideration of their account deposits. In 1995, to ""speed [the] competitive review [process] and reduce regulatory burden on the banking industry"" the Department of Justice and the federal banking agencies developed several initial ""screens"" to identify mergers that would not have adverse effects on competition and would therefore not require significant review. These screens were part of a broader set of Competitive Review Guidelines that also presented additional information that could be considered in the analysis of a merger transaction. The initial screens are based on deposit market share using the Herfindahl- Hirschman index, or HHI. Under this scale, a perfect monopoly would report an HHI of 10,000, while a perfectly competitive market would be close to zero. Under these  screens, any merger that does not result in the HHI exceeding 1,800, post-merger, or increases the market HHI by less than 200, would likely not require further review. Of note, some argue that these guidelines are uniquely strict because the 1,800 HHI level for banking is lower than the 2,500 level set in the Horizontal Merger Guidelines used to evaluate transactions in other industries. In this context, evaluating how a decline in bank charters and bank branches affects how we understand competition is a simple math problem: as banks merge or close branches in a market, the market becomes more concentrated and the HHI increases. In fact, more than 60 percent of the currently defined geographic banking markets in the United States are above the 1,800 threshold. To some, these data are evidence that the marketplace for banking products and services is increasingly anticompetitive, warranting tougher scrutiny of mergers or even a moratorium on any deals. To others, these numbers illustrate a narrow view of bank services in a diverse and complex marketplace. Therefore, they also highlight the importance of including the full ""cluster of commercial banking products and services"" provided to customers in a banking market, since these numbers only provide information on banks. As any quick scan of the marketplace for financial products and services will tell you, in recent decades, the number of competitors to banks, if anything, has significantly increased, rather than decreased. With that in mind, I'd like to discuss what I see as some of the key changes in the competitive landscape for banking products and services. I will also offer some ideas on  how I think we can modernize our analysis of competition while still preserving a vibrant and competitive marketplace that promotes innovation and enhances consumer choice. Let's start with the changes that have been taking place in the credit union industry. Historically, credit unions were not seen as competitors to banks because they offered fewer small business and commercial lending products and were limited in their customer base because of field of membership restrictions. For this reason, credit union deposits were not factored into the initial competitive screens at all under the 1995 Bank However, in the past few decades, we've seen credit unions expand their fields of membership. Many credit unions now go well beyond the traditional ""common bond"" requirements for membership and increasingly allow membership based on geography. We've also seen an increase in the percentage of credit unions offering small business loans. The National Credit Union Administration has reported that 94 percent of credit unions with $500 million or more in assets offer business loans. Total business loans at federally insured credit unions grew at an annualized rate of 14 percent from 2004 through 2015. Underscoring just how much credit unions are competing directly with banks, particularly community banks, is the recent increase in acquisitions of community banks by credit unions. Credit unions today are much more likely to compete directly with traditional banks offering the full ""cluster"" of banking products and services than they did  in 1995, which supports the argument that our analysis needs to give more weight to competition from credit unions. Another development impacting the competitive landscape for banking services is the ability of all banks, regardless of size, to gather deposits across markets and across geographies. Although we've known that online banking gives customers an opportunity to open accounts and establish deposit relationships with any bank in the United States, we've only recently been able to measure how many deposits are gathered via the internet. The FDIC recently began collecting data on deposits through accounts opened online. The data show that online deposits increased by more than 62 percent from 2019 to 2020. Over that same time, deposits at brick-and-mortar branches grew by slightly more than 21 percent. Online deposits increased by another 42 percent from 2020 to 2021, while brick-and-mortar deposits grew by around 10 percent. Online deposits now account for more than 5 percent of all deposits at U.S. commercial banks, and that percentage is expected to increase. Since we know that deposit relationships generally lead customers to develop other types of banking relationships, a comprehensive analysis of competition needs to account for the ubiquity of out-of-market banks with a strong national presence. On the lending side, we've seen nonbanks compete directly with banks for traditional lines of business, including for agricultural loans, one-to-four family mortgage loans, small business loans, and consumer loans. For years, we've seen finance  companies compete with banks for consumer and small business loans and the Farm Credit System compete for agricultural loans. Today we're seeing mortgage companies not only compete, but dominate, the market for residential mortgage loans. Nonbank fintech firms have become viable competitors for nearly all types of loan products, but most prominently consumer loans, small business loans, and student loans. One challenge is that we don't have the same consistent set of data from nonbank entities that we do for banks. Nonbanks are generally not subject to the same types of reporting requirements as banks, and analysts have to get creative when trying to measure how these entities impact competition. A few years ago, research presented at this conference by economists at the Kansas City Fed outlined a process to measure the effects of Farm Credit System lending on market competition. The authors concluded that including Farm Credit lending in competitive analysis of a market ""significantly reduces measures of concentration."" The authors found that ""excluding [Farm Credit] from market structure analyses may understate market competitiveness in rural markets where agriculture is an important part of the local economy."" The authors also state that similar results would likely apply if other significant product lines offered by nonbank competitors were analyzed. With the proliferation of new competitors to traditional banks, it's imperative that we modernize our evaluation of competition to more consistently and comprehensively  factor in all competitors in a market and consider how to address markets where deposits are a poor proxy for the full cluster of products and services offered to consumers and small businesses. Getting this right is particularly important for community banks. The Federal Reserve has long recognized the important public benefits that community banks provide to their communities. Not fully accounting for all competitors in a market limits the options available to banks that need to achieve scale to offer the products and services that customers want while managing the high overhead costs that come with being a regulated depository institution. The consequences of getting this wrong will be felt acutely in rural communities--especially in markets where populations have declined to such an extent that local institutions have trouble achieving the scale they need to compete with out-of- market banks or nonbanks operating on a national or regional scale. As noted in the CSBS National Survey, 30 percent of respondents reported that depopulation was either important or very important to a rural bank's ability to attract and retain deposits. Banks in rural areas may also struggle with succession planning. Attracting and retaining qualified management and staff can be very difficult, and in some cases may force a bank to close its doors, to the detriment of its customers. For banks in these types of communities, the best option might be to merge with another local bank to continue to provide banking services for residents and small businesses. In markets already designated as concentrated or uncompetitive, however, the current guidelines limit  prospective merger partners to out-of-market institutions--and acquisition offers from out-of-market banks in areas of declining population are exceedingly rare. Fortunately, I think we have a unique opportunity today to address these issues. For example, the federal banking agencies and the Department of Justice have acknowledged in recent months that significant changes in the banking industry and in the competitive landscape for banking services will require us to rethink banking competition and mergers. Last year, the President issued an Executive Order on competition encouraging the Attorney General, in consultation with the heads of the federal banking agencies, to review current bank merger review practices and adopt a While my remarks today and these following recommendations highlight issues for community banks, the framework for analyzing bank mergers for large banks also needs to be updated. The goal should be to apply a transparent, dynamic framework that allows the industry to evolve with market conditions and apply sensible regulatory oversight. Size should not be the controlling factor. A review and examination of a merger application should be based on a careful analysis of risks. I believe any review of banking merger oversight should ensure that the framework that is used is known and understood by the public and by the banks, that it reflects actual market conditions, and that it factors in the broader range of competitors to banks for financial products and services. I will outline a few specific areas that, in my view, should be included as part of any modernization proposal for competitive analysis:  More systematically include credit unions in all competitive analyses. noted earlier, credit unions were historically not considered competitors to banks, but changes to their business models and membership criteria now make them direct competitors in many markets. Credit unions whose field of membership includes all, or almost all, of the market populations, whose branches are easily accessible to the public, who engage in a significant amount of commercial lending and who have staff available for small business services, or who have acquired a community bank should be part of any initial competitive screen. It's also important that the National Credit Union Administration collect more granular deposit information from credit unions so we can better understand their local market power. Similar activity should be subject to similar data collection and regulation. Factor in deposits at digital banks. Since online deposits are not reportable at the branch level, it's important that we account for deposits and loans offered by banks that have established a national digital presence. As mentioned earlier, recent data suggest that more than 5 percent of all deposits in the banking system were collected through online means. In the absence of specific data about a digital bank's presence in a market, those deposits should be weighed in pro rata in each banking market at the percentage reported annually in the Summary of Deposits in any competitive analysis. Consider nonbank financial firms in all competitive analyses. nonbank financial firms do not generally provide the full range of banking products and services to consumers, they do exert competitive pressures in  banking markets across the United States. Since 1995, nonbanks have increasingly become important competitors for banks, capable of exerting substantial market pressure in some product markets. We need to capture these granular competitive effects across different geographic and product markets. One way to do this is by relaxing the deposit-market-based HHI thresholds in the current bank merger guidelines to reflect the increased competitive influence banks face from nonbanks today. This is also an area where I think our research partners can help us better understand how to factor in competition from nonbank entities. In my view, in order to support increased transparency, the Federal Reserve should review its approach to defining banking markets to ensure they are updated consistently and reflect the changes in how consumers in a community access banking products and services. factors analysis through its development and maintenance of the Competitive Analysis The tool gives the public direct insights into the currently defined banking markets in the United States and allows for the pro forma evaluation of the competitive effects of actual and even hypothetical mergers. The initial screens that are currently used in competitive analysis are built into the tool and can be updated as things change. As we work to develop a more comprehensive process for evaluating competition, the CASSIDI team  should add data and even new functionality to the tool to ensure that we are working from a common set of rules in our analysis. To wrap up, competition is vital to ensuring that we continue to have a vibrant and innovative banking industry. In the 10 years of this research conference, we've seen how competition has led to the adoption of a suite of digital products and services by banks of all sizes. From remote deposit capture, online account openings, and automated underwriting, to interactive teller machines, banks with more than $1 trillion in assets and those with less than $100 million in assets are both able to quickly onboard new technology to meet consumer demand. This has further led to a proliferation of tailored products and services that meet the unique needs of bank customers. We've seen how competition from new, tech-savvy, core service providers has led legacy providers to enhance their product offerings and capabilities. At the same time, we've seen how these same technologies that enhance the banking experience can also be used by nonbanks to compete directly with banks. While banks have adjusted their business models to address new competitive threats and changing customer demand, the framework for evaluating competition has not changed significantly since 1995. As these new competitors increasingly provide consumers with alternative delivery channels for the cluster of banking products and services they desire, we need to make sure we take appropriate steps to understand the competitive pressure they exert and modernize our approaches to measuring competition. Our current framework is meant to promote a competitive marketplace for banking products and services. But if that framework does not account for the full range  of competitors, we're only restricting banks from making strategic merger choices, while allowing those outside the framework to proliferate. Competition is at the foundation of our financial and economic system. As the banking industry changes, we need to change how we think about competition for banking products and services and modernize our approach to competitive analysis that promotes a healthy banking and financial system, supports consumer choice, and creates the right incentives for continued innovation.","['banking', 'banks', 'bankers', 'policymakers', 'stakeholders']","['rethink banking', 'research conference', 'community banking', 'community bankers', 'community banks']","['research community banking', 'banking world conference', 'community banking recent', 'policymakers community bankers', 'conference federal reserve']","['research conference', 'community banking', 'community bankers', 'much effort community banks', 'conference research committee']"
3237,r220928a_ECB,euro area,2022-09-28,The ECB’s monetary policy strategy: delivering our mandate in all circumstances,elderson,0,"Many thanks for giving me the opportunity to deliver the introductory remarks at this conference on greening monetary policy at a time when inflation is far too high. Although I am delivering these remarks remotely, it is always a privilege to speak directly to you, the elected representatives of Europe's citizens, the very same citizens - served by EU institutions, including the European Central Bank - who are united in their commitment to foster peace and stability in their part of the world, even when that very world is subject to significant transformation and upheaval. The pandemic and the war have shaken the environment in which the EU must address the vital challenges that it faces, including the ongoing climate and environmental crises. Since Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, the global economic outlook has become much less favourable. Having said that, the invasion has not shaken the EU's resolve to address the challenges faced. In actual fact, the war and the ensuing energy crisis have only served to increase EU authorities' determination to reduce the bloc's dependence on fossil energy sources. Even if in the very near-term the energy crisis may cause an increase in non-gas fossil fuel being used, the likelihood of a timely and orderly transition towards a low-carbon economy consistent with the EU's commitment to the Paris Agreement has increased. That being said, another record-breaking summer has confirmed that physical risks of climate change and environmental degradation are materialising ever more frequently, which will add to the risk of increased macroeconomic volatility until the transition has been completed. When the boat we all share is rocked to such an extent by external forces, we need to be able to count on internal anchors of stability. The ECB provides one of those crucial internal anchors by pursuing its mandate of maintaining price stability in the euro area as laid down in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. In line with that mandate, our primary concern is, as always, our primary objective: price stability. Inflation is currently far too high. The shocks that are hitting the euro area economy have not only led to a turning point in the outlook for economic activity but are also contributing to further upward price pressures that are much stronger and more persistent than we previously anticipated. This implies that inflation is likely to stay above our 2% target for an extended period. As a result, we accelerated the pace of monetary policy normalisation over the summer to ensure that monetary policy is consistent with inflation returning to our target in the medium term. We have communicated that we will take a meeting-by-meeting approach in assessing the appropriate next steps in monetary policy normalisation. As reiterated by President Lagarde at the European Parliament earlier this week, the direction of travel is clear, and we will raise rates further in the pursuit of our objective . This will avoid that our monetary policy puts upward pressure on prices by sustaining demand when supply is constrained. It will also guard against the risk of a persistent upward shift in inflation expectations. At the same time, with many of the sources of today's inflation originating from supply constraints, government policies that redirect public and private investment to supporting sustainable growth can help mitigate inflationary pressures in the medium to longer term. In any case, these investments are crucial to achieving the EU's aim of meeting the goals outlined in the Paris Agreement. As acknowledged in our monetary policy strategy, given the profound implications of climate change for price stability and its clear and unequivocal status as a policy priority for the EU, the ECB is committed to ensuring that we take climate change fully into account in the pursuit of our mandate. This is indeed a strategic commitment - it applies to every phase of the business cycle, irrespective of the type of shocks that hit the euro area. The same is true for our commitment to our price stability target. It therefore follows that our actions in pursuit of price stability do not undermine our commitment to incorporate climate change considerations, within our mandate. Similarly, this same commitment does not undermine our commitment to price stability. Nor does it in any way restrict our ability to deliver price stability, even in the challenging circumstances we are currently facing. Not only have we started policy rate normalisation with an unprecedented 125 basis point increase in our rates over the last two Governing Council meetings, we have also released details of how we aim to decarbonise our corporate bond holdings on a path aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement. As of next Monday, we will start tilting our corporate bond purchases towards issuers with a better climate performance. This is a milestone in the implementation of our climate action plan which will reduce our exposure to climate-related financial risks and support the green transition of the European economy in line with the EU's climate neutrality objectives. The climate action plan that we unveiled in the summer of last year is not an aim in itself. The ECB is committed to regularly reviewing all the measures it has introduced. This means that we will assess the effects of these measures and adapt them, if necessary: (1) to confirm that they continue to fulfil their monetary policy objectives; (2) to ensure - within our mandate - that the relevant measures continue to support the decarbonisation path to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement and the EU climate neutrality objectives; (3) to respond to future improvements in climate data and climate risk modelling or changes in regulation; and (4) to look beyond climate and address additional environmental challenges, within our mandate. While I understand it is not a specific topic covered in today's conference, a similar commitment to fully incorporate climate-related and environmental risks applies to our banking supervision tasks and responsibilities. In addition to the climate stress test that was concluded by ECB Banking Supervision earlier this year, we will soon publish the results of our thematic review. As part of this exercise, our core banking supervision teams - Joint Supervisory Teams - thoroughly assessed to what extent banks' risk management practices for climate-related and environmental risks live up to the supervisory expectations we published in 2020. We conducted this exercise to assess where banks stand with regard to our expectations and to highlight any gaps they urgently need to close. We will also take the opportunity to identify and share best practices to help banks close any gaps identified. And we will insist that banks' risk management practices are fully aligned with all our expectations by the end of 2024 at the latest. It is clear that central banks and supervisors are not primarily responsible for addressing the ongoing climate and environmental crises. They are climate and environment policy-takers, whereas governments and legislators - including the European Parliament - are climate and environment policymakers. The European Union and its co-legislators are clearly committed to the Paris Agreement. The EU is taking concrete steps to implement legislation that puts this commitment into practice. Central banks and supervisors cannot ignore this in the pursuit of their mandate. Similarly, on the path to meeting the Paris Agreement goals, we cannot ignore scenarios which include a greater manifestation of physical risks from climate change and environmental degradation. And we will not ignore all this. To the contrary. We acknowledge that we cannot deliver on our mandate if we assume a status quo in which the world will not transition as the baseline scenario for the future. And by rejecting that status quo as the baseline, we are becoming a force that contributes to the transition. And we will continue to be just that: a force that contributes to the transition. Within our mandate. And in the pursuit of our mandate.

7678,r220928b_FOMC,united states,2022-09-28,Welcoming Remarks,powell,1,"For release on delivery by at the Good morning, and welcome to the 10th annual Community Banking Research Conference. I have attended this conference twice before, including the first one back in 2013, and I can attest to the quality of the research and discussions. While I am coming to you virtually today, many of you are gathering in person for the first time in three years. I am sure it will make an excellent event even more enjoyable. regulators, policymakers, and community bankers to discuss the unique and important role community banks play in our economy. The conference was launched in the years following the financial crisis, in a collaboration by the Federal Reserve, the Conference (FDIC). The conference was developed to deepen our understanding of the community bank business model and to provide a forum to discuss research with academics, policymakers, regulators, and community bankers. The research presented over the years has informed supervisory and regulatory policy debates and continues to challenge our thinking. It has highlighted the vital links between community banks and small businesses, the availability of credit in low- and moderate-income communities, how community banks support their local communities in times of crisis, and the impact of technology. A critical feature of the research sessions is that community bankers join academic moderators to provide feedback from a practitioner's perspective. The challenges facing community banks have changed significantly over the past 10 years. Community banks have demonstrated remarkable resilience, and conferences like this have helped regulators and supervisors to better understand those changes.  I want to congratulate the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis for a decade of hosting an important and informative conference. And I want to thank our colleagues at the Fed, the FDIC, and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors. On a sadder note, I want to recognize the passing of John Ryan, who was president of the CSBS, this past May. John's impact on the CSBS and his contributions to the financial services sector overall were significant, and he is missed by all who knew and worked with him. Thanks also to the researchers and all the community banking professionals for their insight and contributions over the years. Thank you all, and have a great conference.","['banking', 'banks', 'bankers', 'bank', 'community']","['community banking', 'community banks', 'community bank', 'community bankers', 'banking research']","['community banking research', 'understanding community bank', 'community bankers discuss', 'community bankers research', 'communities community banks']","['10th annual community banking research conference', 'important role community banks', 'community banks', 'community banking professionals', 'community bankers']"
6130,r220928a_BOE,united kingdom,2022-09-28,Innovation in post trade services,cunliffe,0,"In recent years, regulators and central banks have become increasingly focussed on 'crypto'. No meeting of the international regulatory or central banking community takes place without a discussion of some aspect of the financial products, services and technologies that have come to be labelled 'crypto'. Not surprisingly, given their explosive growth and wholly unregulated markets, much of the focus has been on crypto assets, particularly the highly speculative, assets like Bitcoin and the so called 'stablecoins' that function as the settlement asset for much of crypto trading and settlement. This focus has in my view been entirely appropriate. The regulatory community's assessment that crypto assets and platforms carried major risks but did not yet pose risks to the broader financial system was borne out both by the collapse in crypto values and of some coins we saw earlier this year and the lack of wider knock-on impacts. Nonetheless this is a corner of the financial system that has been growing very quickly and that has begun to develop greater interconnection with the conventional financial system. There are well established concerns around consumer protection and financial integrity, which need to be addressed, and there is a need to think now about systemic consequences. We have seen in other areas the disruptive power of digital technologies and the difficulties of retrofitting regulation once new models have achieved systemic scale. Regulators need to begin extending existing standards and regulatory regimes to crypto before not after it is becomes systemically important. And done carefully, the development of regulatory regimes helps not hinders innovation by reducing the risks of confidence-destroying crashes and by giving innovators a framework within which to innovate. However, while it has been right to focus attention on assets and platforms of the crypto world, the greater impact on the financial system may well come from the transfer of technologies developed in the crypto world to the 'real' world: for the trading, clearing storing and settlement of 'real' assets (and the making of payments for real things). So we need to think also about the potentially disruptive impact of crypto technologies on market infrastructure, the trading, clearing, settlement, and custody machinery that enables global capital markets. This is an important issue for me both as the Deputy Governor at the Bank of England responsible for the regulation and supervision of post trade infrastructure in one of the largest global financial centres and as Chair of the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructure. In that respect this first OPTIC conference is very timely. This is an area of finance where lots of experimentation has been happening for a while. In some markets we are now beginning to see real world applications built on exactly this transfer of technologies developed in the crypto world. And as the crypto world continues to innovate, it is likely that we will see not only more technology transfer, but crypto native entities with the ambition to cross the boundary between the crypto world and conventional finance to offer services with tokenised forms of real assets. I want to focus today on the potential impacts of this on post trade infrastructure, where the opportunity for technological disruption may well be greatest. And I will use three lenses: opportunity, risk, and the provision of public infrastructure. First, the opportunity. European trading platforms have come a long way from the days of exchanging paper certificates and shouting across trading floors, pits and desks which was still the main way to intermediate most financial markets as recently as the early 2000s. Almost all trading is now electronic - investors have gone from placing trades via direct dial up connections in the 1980s, to internet-based trading in the 1990s to the more recent rise of robo-advisors . Investors have a growing choice of trading venues, many of which can be accessed on a mobile phone. A growing number of venues allow investors to place trades commission-free. In the existing system, while it takes nanoseconds (billionth of a second) to strike a trade, there are a number of necessary post trade functions which follow and which at present have to be fulfilled sequentially. This includes trade validation and clearing, before settlement (transfer of assets) can finally take place. Depending on the market, these processes take at least a day and often more. They require a large number of participants to share information with each other -- often through highly manual processes. Because settlement takes time, a number of risks emerge which all have to be managed. The price of the securities may change, the securities or cash may not be delivered in time and a counterparty could fail during the time it takes for the trade to settle. These processes are important, but expensive. Precisely because the functions here are spread across a range of players estimates of the total cost are difficult to establish. In 2013 an attempt to do so suggested that around 13% of the total trade value chain was spent by the industry on settlement, custody and collateral management, around $40-45bn. Innovation over the past thirty years has, to be sure, improved efficiency but there is recognition from the industry that more can be done. The Post-Trade Taskforce, an industry-led body made up of participants in wholesale markets and with the Bank of England as an observer, set out earlier this year that ""innovation in post-trade processes and client onboarding processes has at times lagged behind other parts of financial markets. As a result, processes are often manual and duplicative; and failures upstream can cause significant problems downstream"". It is in the context of this 'opportunity' that we should look at the possibilities for disruption of the current post trade landscape that might come from the innovative approaches and technologies that have been developed for the trading, clearing and settlement of cryptoassets. At the heart of this is the exchange of tokenised representations of the money and the securities traded in the mainstream financial sector today, such as equities and debt instruments. Bringing both components of the trade onto a single ledger facilitates near-instant settlement of trades and, building on modern cryptography, atomic settlement. Deriving its term from the use of 'atomicity' in computer programming, ""an atomic operation is one which cannot be (or is not) interrupted by concurrent operations"" . Put another way, nothing can interfere with the underlying security and money while the operation is running. In its application within securities settlement this process closely mirrors delivery vs payment, given the role for earmarking. In practice, unlike more conventional settlement processes, atomic settlement is often completed near-instantaneously and can happen without the need for trusted intermediaries, though I should stress that it need not be instantaneous or decentralised. It is the combination of high-speed and atomicity that created the rationale for much of experimentation with DLT by that has been happening in the financial sector. And it is the foundation for the development in the crypto world of protocols capable of more complex financial operations. I want briefly to highlight a number of ways in which these developments could disrupt the current post trade architecture and business models. First, and by far the most significant, is the potential for consolidation across both trade and post-trade functions. Cryptoasset exchanges have collapsed a large number of activities into a single smart contract undertaking activities that, in conventional securities trading, are split across custody banks, exchanges, central counterparties and central securities depositories. Where, in the conventional trade and post trade chain there are layers of entities performing specific functions, in the crypto world the functions in the chain can be brought together in a single smart contract. The potential gains in cost from consolidation could be very large. For the end investor, fewer intermediaries should mean less fees. Moreover, from the point of view of regulators looking at the stability of the system as a whole, a single entity and process carrying out all of these functions would require fewer participants in the chain and, in principle at least, bring resilience benefits from the simplified structure. With fewer critical points in the chain, the potential points of failure in the system are reduced. Consolidation, by definition, reduces the number of intermediaries. However, some have proposed that this disintermediation could go further into a full decentralisation of the trade and post trade process. There are DeFi platforms for example which purport at least to offer prospect of complete disintermediation. In these models smart contracts on the permission-less blockchain, using platforms like Ethereum, allow users to transact with pools of assets, rather than each other, and without handing over custody of their assets to a third party. Users initiate a trade by proposing a transaction that sends tokens to a smart contract, which in turn calls a function to perform the exchange i.e. send the appropriate value of alternative tokens from the pool back to the user. In principle, this could further reduce costs and promote efficiency. Second, as a consequence of bringing trade and post trade functions into a single smart contract, T+now settlement has become routine in some crypto markets. Such instantaneous settlement offers the prospect of eliminating settlement risk from the equation by collapsing the time during which a party can fail to deliver on its obligations to another party to zero. In centrally-cleared cash markets, this removes the need for a CCP to net security trades. It also removes the need for a CCP to hold and pass through margin when clearing cash trades. Third, new systems can enable fractionalisation - or breaking up financial instruments into smaller units - which is also being increasingly borrowed from cryptoasset markets with the aim of improving market liquidity. Benefits might be particularly large for illiquid markets (e.g. leveraged loans) which don't currently benefit from a CSD. As such, we would expect the potential benefits of Tokenisation/DLT to be more pronounced in these areas. Perhaps most far reaching, smart contracts appear to have the potential to go much further than integrating trade and post trade functions into a single operation. In a simple case, like that discussed earlier, a smart contract delivers instant settlement by combining checks that the securities and cash being exchanged are available in respective accounts with the execution of the post-trade process. This may be expanded on, as smart contracts automate actions depending on conditions being met. There is the potential to add layers of additional functionality and features. Given the flexibility of the technology, there is the potential to incorporate related services. For example, the payment of coupons on bonds and the management of other corporate actions, or the management of more sophisticated securities trades, for example the selection of collateral in a repo transaction. I should stress, however, that this is not an exhaustive list. If recent years have taught us anything it is the ability of innovation in this digital space to come up with very different ways of doing things. My point is that we should be ready to see major changes in capital market infrastructures and business models that could in principle bring benefits in efficiency, speed and resilience. How should regulators, respond to these developments? It is important that we start from the position of being technology and business model blind: we not classify new ways of doing things as 'dangerous' simply because they are different. I have set out some of the potential benefits, for efficiency and for financial stability. But recognising the opportunity does not mean that we should ignore the risks, any more than we ignore the risks in the existing structures. We need to ensure that new approaches deliver the same level of resilience that we expect for the existing system. In short, we need to ensure the same regulatory outcome even where changes in technology and business model mean that we have to find different ways of achieving it. I set out briefly a few examples of the areas of risks we will need to look at. Like the examples I gave earlier of potential benefits, the list is by no means exhaustive. First, operational resilience of DLT-based systems needs to be proven over time. The technology most widely used in existing cryptocurrencies cannot simply be copied and pasted for wide scale use in capital markets. This is not simply because it currently operates in an unregulated environment. Given the systemic nature of the major capital markets, we will need assurance that DLT based systems can work in different contexts and at a different scale . Second, the development of instantaneous settlement also poses challenges for the management of liquidity as it requires all cash and securities to be in place at the time a trade is struck. There would no longer be a window of opportunity to locate the cash and securities or to net trades against each other. And if each securities ledger has its own cash token, aggregate liquidity requirements could be increased further . Given well documented challenges with the potential for a 'jump to illiquidity', including in core funding markets, this has the potential to increase systemic risk. Third, we have seen from other areas of the financial system, such as retail payments, that the irrevocability that comes with instant transactions can pose problems for risk management. There is simply no time to identify or rectify errors before they are actioned. In short we may not want wholly instantaneous trading and settlement in all markets. Fourth, it is unclear how feasible and effective interoperability between DLT platforms would be and how effective interoperability between markets and services running on DLT and those running on conventional systems. This could well lead to a fragmentation where these products become siloed, with only one option available to market participants who would provide for exchange, settlement and clearing. Finally, supervision of financial market infrastructure places a heavy emphasis on ensuring robust governance procedures are in place. While there are advantages to consolidating functions, as set out above, and there are arguments in favour of decentralisation, it is very difficult to see how risks can be managed to the right level without a legal entity accountable for the services provided and responsible for the proper functioning of the system. And, of course, there are risks in any transition. For example, markets would be subject to two modes of settlement and clearing, as adoption and experimentation with this technology grow. This poses specific challenges, for example managing liquidity across systems, but would also pose operational burdens. Given the range of policy questions - regulatory, supervisory and legal - these developments raise, market infrastructure regulators will need to and are beginning to step up their engagement. There is a need to understand better emerging technologies and how, as well as to what extent, regulatory regimes need to be extended or otherwise adapted to cover their use. One example of this greater engagement, in the UK, is the FMI Sandbox, which the Bank of England, the Financial Conduct Authority and HM Treasury have announced and plan to have up and running in 2023. The Sandbox will allow financial market infrastructure providers and other relevant parties to test and adopt new technologies and practices (such as distributed ledger technology) by temporarily disapplying or modifying certain legislation for specific purposes. The initial focus will be exploring the application of distributed ledger technology by firms who want to set up DLT securities settlement systems integrated with trading platforms. These regulatory considerations around innovation in the trade and post-trade process are being taken forward in multiple jurisdictions internationally, posing the same questions across regulatory frameworks . And given the cross border nature of many financial infrastructure services, there will almost certainly be a role for CPMI-IOSCO as the international standard setter for financial market infrastructure need to explore . Safe settlement requires a settlement asset which market participants can use and have confidence in to discharge their obligations. Given the need to ensure such settlement assets, particularly in systemic global capital markets meet the very highest levels of resilience, the PFMI set out the standard, namely that ""An FMI should conduct its money settlements in central bank money where practical and available. If central bank money is not used, an FMI should minimise and strictly control the credit and liquidity risk arising from the use of commercial bank money"". It is vital that we maintain at least the same level of robustness for settlement assets used in new, innovative approaches to post trade functions. The CPMI and IOSCO have, in this context, set out for example guidance on how the PFMI standards on settlement assets should apply to systemic stablecoins. But there is my view a case for public infrastructure in this area. Central bank reserves, as a settlement asset play a key role in the resilience of conventional post trade functions. In addition, the central banks provides the rails on which those assets are transferred in their jurisdictions, typically through real time gross settlement (RTGS) systems. How then should settlement in central bank money evolve to play a similar role to provide resilience in new approaches using atomic settlement and DLT? There are a number of ways in which central bank money might evolve to play that role. One option would be for central bank could build its own system offering both a tokenised form of central bank money and the rails on which it is transacted. Another route would be for central banks to develop their existing RTGS systems to ensure compatibility with DLT based systems enabling the latter to 'plug in' to settlement in central bank money. Alternatively, central banks could allow private sector players that have access to central bank reserves a greater ability to transact those reserves, allowing those firms to organise connectivity to other ledgers amongst themselves. Different approaches to access to wholesale digital central bank money, are being explored at the international level, in particular through practical experimentation out of the BIS's Innovation Hub. The BIS work has demonstrated a set of model approaches which allow for settlement in tokenised central bank money (project Helvetia). This would allow for the connection of such tokenised assets to DLT based clearing and settlement. The Innovation Hub is also running Project Meridian, out of its London centre, which will develop a prototype synchronisation operator, an intermediary platform that connects counterparties and coordinates the settlement process directly in central bank money. In principle this would allow for private firms operating on different ledger technologies to plug into and delivery functionality while using central bank money. These experiments show the range of approaches which are under consideration and highlights the importance of applied experimentation by central banks to understand these new technologies and their implications for policy. At the Bank of England we are taking forward work on these options. In particular, we are in the process of renewing our RTGS system. This includes consulting on the Roadmap for RTGS beyond 2024, with a view to assessing appetite for many of the features and functionalities which would enable integration with DLT-based services. Examples of the functionalities under consideration here include create a generic interface into RTGS which would allow a range of ledgers to connect to the system, as well as building a system with no technical barriers to 24/7 operation. Relatedly, we have already put in place an omnibus account policy, allowing for the co-mingling of reserves held by different entities within one account, overseen by a payment system operator. This allows the payment system operator to pre-fund transactions between these entities using reserves, creating a means of settling transactions which is fully funded in central bank money, thereby enabling the operator to link this to transactions on other ledgers. Finally, when talking about the public sector's role, we should not forget that legal structures underpin all financial services, given the critical nature of establishing and agreeing ownership. This is particularly true in the process of transferring ownership (i.e. exchange and settlement) given the potential, where such processes break down, for ambiguity and contractual dispute. As such, it is critical that legal structures evolve to ensure there is clarity on their application as technologies for trade and post-trade services evolve. Work to this effect is ongoing across jurisdictions and in both the public and private sectors. In English law, this process has begun with the clarification in 2019 that ""cryptoassets have all of the indicia of property"" and that smart contracts carried the status of contracts as understood in law . ISDA have extended this analysis further looking at a range of legal issues arising around clearing and settlement across English, French, Irish, Japanese, Singaporean and US laws . Ensuring robust legal underpinning will be an essential part of managing risks in the use of these new technologies. From the development of double entry book-keeping, to the telex machine, to algorithmic trading, over the centuries successive technological innovations have transformed finance. While this has not been without risk - and there have been problems on the way - the result has generally been deeper, more liquid and more efficient financial markets, better able to serve the real economy. In this, as in so many other areas, central bankers and regulators do not have a crystal ball. But I think the emerging evidence is clear that the technological innovation we have seen in crypto markets offers at least the possibility of a major transformation in financial market infrastructure - and one that could yield significant benefit. It is also clear that for this to happen, there are important risks that will need to be managed and areas where public infrastructure will need to evolve. Close engagement between the private sector and public authorities will be crucial to ensuring we reap the benefits while managing the risks. In that respect, as I have said, this conference is very timely and I am grateful for the opportunity to share these thoughts. Thank you.

The special MPC meeting on 19 March was convened by the Governor under the provisions of paragraph 10(2) They are available at .

In that context, its challenge over recent weeks has been to respond to the severe economic and financial disruption caused by the spread of Covid-19. The spread of the disease and the measures that are likely to be needed to contain it have evolved significantly. The economic consequences of these developments are becoming more apparent and a very sharp reduction in activity is likely. Given the severity of that disruption, there is a risk of longer-term damage to the economy, especially if there are business failures on a large scale or significant increases in unemployment. In the near term, many people will be unable to work for a period and others are adjusting their working arrangements. Many consumer-facing companies are now required to cease operations for a time, while other businesses have also needed to cease or scale back their activities. Household spending on social activities and other delayable forms of consumption is likely to decline materially. In an environment of heightened uncertainty, businesses are likely to postpone investment decisions. Exports are likely to weaken. These effects on economic activity will be offset partly by temporarily higher spending on essential goods and services. Nonetheless, business cashflows will be severely affected in a way that, without support measures, would threaten material numbers of businesses failing, and large and persistent rises in unemployment. There is little evidence as yet to assess the precise magnitude of the economic shock from Covid-19. It is probable that global GDP will fall sharply during the first half of this year. Unemployment is likely to rise rapidly across a range of economies, as suggested by early indicators. In the United Kingdom, even before the introduction of the most recent social distancing measures, the composite flash output and expectation PMIs fell sharply in March to their all-time lowest levels, consistent with a material contraction in GDP. Other timely indicators of activity, such as footfall in shops and the number of flights, have also declined sharply. There have been very significant moves in a range of financial market prices and implied volatilities have risen to historically elevated levels, with evidence of widespread disruption to market functioning. Risky asset prices have fallen and, in the period leading up to the MPC's special meeting on 19 March, yields on longer-term government debt rose. Additional demand for US dollar liquidity contributed to disruption in dollar funding markets, and in other usually liquid markets. The sterling exchange rate has depreciated sharply. Overall, UK and global financial conditions have tightened materially. All major central banks have set out wide- ranging policy responses that have helped to stabilise markets and improve liquidity in government bond markets. What public policy is doing The front line of combatting the challenges of Covid-19 comprises the extraordinary efforts of NHS health professionals, carers and volunteers across the country. Monetary policy should take into account the broader public policy response to reduce the disruptive consequences for households and businesses of the spread of Covid-19. This should help to minimise the longer-term damage to the economy when the health crisis abates. In this environment, it is essential that monetary and financial stability are maintained, as these are pre- requisites of longer-term economic prosperity. Consistent with this, the Bank of England has coordinated its actions with those of the UK Government in order to ensure that these initiatives are complementary and have maximum impact in supporting households and businesses during this period of disruption. The Government has announced a series of substantial fiscal support measures to alleviate some of the severe cashflow problems facing businesses and households. The Bank of England also has a role to play in supporting businesses and households through the economic disruption associated with Covid-19. exposures to UK borrowers at its policy meeting on 9 March. This action supports the ability of banks to supply the credit needed by households and businesses. The FPC, together with the Prudential Regulation Committee, will monitor closely the response of banks to recent measures, as well as the credit conditions faced by UK businesses and households more generally. the Bank would act as HM Treasury's agent. This will provide funding to businesses by purchasing commercial paper of up to a one-year maturity. As an alternative source of finance for larger companies, the scheme will help preserve the capacity of the banking system to lend to other companies, including small and medium-sized enterprises. The CCFF is being funded by the issuance of additional central bank reserves but is set up in a separate legal entity from the Bank and from the Asset Purchase Facility. The MPC will continue to decide on the overall amount of asset purchases that are financed by central bank reserves. It is therefore taking the size of the CCFF into account when taking its decisions on the target stock of government and corporate bonds financed by reserves necessary to fulfil its remit. The role of monetary policy As set out in the Chancellor's letter on 11 March, the MPC has statutory objectives to maintain price stability and, subject to that, to support the economic policy of the Government including its objectives for growth and employment. The updated remit letter confirms that the operational target for monetary policy remains an CPI inflation was 1.7% in February. Prior to recent developments, inflation was already set to fall further below the MPC's 2% target. It is now likely to decline to below 1% in the spring, reflecting the pass-through to fuel prices of the recent and sharp decline in the oil price. Further ahead, inflation will be boosted by the significant depreciation of the sterling exchange rate. The MPC will be monitoring closely developments in inflation and in indicators of inflation expectations, including those of households, businesses and financial markets. Financial market measures of inflation expectations have not risen over recent weeks. The nature of the economic shock from Covid-19 is very different from those to which the MPC has previously had to respond. The scale and duration of the shock to economic activity, while highly uncertain, will be large and sharp but should ultimately prove temporary, particularly if job losses and business failures can be minimised. In the current circumstances, and consistent with the MPC's remit, monetary policy is aimed at guarding against an unwarranted tightening in financial conditions and, more broadly, supporting businesses and households through the crisis and limiting any lasting damage to the economy. What the MPC is doing Over recent weeks, the MPC has reduced Bank Rate by 65 basis points, from 0.75% to 0.1%, and introduced a announced an increase in the stock of asset purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, by PS200 billion to a total of PS645 billion. Those purchases are being undertaken as soon as operationally possible, consistent with improved market functioning. The majority of additional asset purchases would comprise UK government bonds. Some additional sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bonds would also be purchased. Committee also voted unanimously for the Bank of England to continue with the programme of PS200 billion of UK government bond and sterling non-financial investment-grade corporate bond purchases, financed by the issuance of central bank reserves, to take the total stock of these purchases to PS645 billion. The MPC will monitor closely the pass-through to banks and building societies' lending rates of the recent reductions in Bank Rate. Regarding the impact of asset purchases, gilt yields fell significantly following the previous week's special MPC meeting and the commencement of additional gilt purchase operations from 20 March. If needed, the MPC can expand asset purchases further. The MPC will continue to monitor the situation closely and, consistent with its remit, stands ready to respond further as necessary to guard against an unwarranted tightening in financial conditions, and support the economy. consider the response of monetary policy to the economic shock from Covid-19. In these extraordinary circumstances, the meeting had been called under the provisions of paragraph 10(2) of Schedule 3 to the Bank In order to support the MPC's policy deliberations around both its special meeting and the regularly scheduled MPC meeting ending on 25 March 2020, the Committee had been briefed by Bank staff on recent developments, including: financial markets; the international economy; and current economic conditions. Data covering the period prior to the escalation of the spread of Covid-19 The official UK economic data released since the MPC's special meeting on 10 March had related principally to the period prior to the escalation of the spread of Covid-19. GDP had been flat in the three months to January compared to the previous three months, broadly in line with the expectation at the time of the . Employment growth had remained robust, at 0.6% in the three months to January, although the unemployment rate had ticked up to 3.9%. Whole economy total pay growth had been 3.1%, a little softer than projected in the January . CPI inflation had fallen to 1.7% in February, in line with the January . Economic channels and impacts related to the spread of Covid-19 The spread of Covid-19 and the measures that were likely to be needed to contain it had evolved significantly and very rapidly over recent weeks. The economic consequences of these developments were becoming more apparent and a very sharp reduction in economic activity was likely. The Committee discussed: the economic channels and impacts related to the spread of Covid-19; the risks of longer-term damage to the economy, especially if there were business failures on a large scale or significant increases in unemployment; and the appropriate role for economic policy. Many people would be unable to work as normal for a period of time. In response to social distancing measures, some people might be able to work from home. Others would, however, be unable to work while their companies had to cease, or were severely curtailing, operations temporarily. These effects would vary across individuals and sectors of the economy. The reduction in the demand for labour could significantly increase unemployment. If workers were laid off for a temporary period, or lost their jobs and were unable to find another one, they would suffer a reduction in their incomes. In those circumstances, some households would be able to draw down on their savings or borrow to smooth their consumption. But others, with limited savings or ability to borrow, would have to restrict their spending involuntarily. Moreover, people who remained employed might become concerned that they would lose their jobs and see their incomes fall, possibly leading to a precautionary reduction in spending. Spending was also likely to be depressed significantly as a result of social distancing measures. People who were isolated at home would be unable to spend as usual on social activities, including at restaurants and hotels, on leisure travel, and sporting and cultural events, which together accounted for around a fifth of consumption in the United Kingdom. Work-related spending, for instance on transport fares and fuel, would also go down if people were either working more from home or not working; this represented around a tenth of household spending. Economic uncertainty and confidence effects generated by the spread of Covid-19 would amplify the reduction in household consumption. This could mean that households would spend less on consumption that could be postponed, such as of durable goods, which accounted for around a fifth of spending. They might also be more reluctant to make major decisions such as purchasing a house. Household spending on essential goods and services, such as food and drink, was likely to rise in the short term. For instance, households could substitute away from eating out to eating at home and they could bring forward purchases of non-perishable food. Although essential goods and services accounted for around half of household spending, the probable large fall in other types of consumption implied that there would be a substantial reduction in the overall level of household spending. Partly as a consequence, companies' revenues would be depressed, in some cases severely. Some businesses would cease operations on a temporary basis. Those who had not suspended activities could suffer a loss of revenue in the face of reduced customer demand. In addition, the diminished availability of workers and disruptions to supply chains at home and abroad would reduce some companies' ability to produce. In the face of economic uncertainty and reduced confidence about the outlook, firms were likely to respond by delaying spending where possible, notably on capital goods. Falls in risky asset prices could raise the cost of capital faced by firms and amplify the initial reduction in economic activity. In such circumstances, firms might respond to the significant, but ultimately temporary, reduction in their revenues by laying off staff as well as mothballing or scrapping capital equipment. There was a risk of business failures on a large scale. The experience of companies across the economy was likely to differ markedly. In companies in some sectors, a margin of excess supply could open up in the face of depressed demand. In other sectors, companies might find it difficult to meet increased demand, either because of households switching away from spending on social activities to those companies' products and services, or because domestic or international supply chain difficulties could lead to a lack of access to key inputs. Lower demand in some sectors might lead some firms to cut prices, while higher costs or high demand in others might put upward pressure on prices. In addition, there could be a direct impact on consumer prices from changes in import prices, either because of exchange rate developments or changes in foreign prices, particularly those of oil and other commodities. The MPC would continue to monitor a range of indicators of inflation expectations to ensure that they remained anchored to the 2% target. In these extraordinary circumstances, the aim of economic policy was to minimise the disruptive consequences for households and businesses of the spread of Covid-19. It could do that through measures to maintain the availability of finance or reduce the cost of borrowing, improving cashflows and supporting spending by consumers and companies. The government could also offer direct support in the form of tax relief and loans, which would improve cashflows and would encourage businesses to furlough workers rather than laying them off, in turn maintaining household incomes and spending. Given the severity of the expected disruption to activity, there was a risk of longer-term damage to the economy when the health crisis abated, especially if there were business failures on a large scale or significant increases in unemployment. The aim of economic policy was to help to minimise that damage. Recent developments Financial markets Between the MPC's special meetings ending on 10 March and on 19 March, there had been a significant further tightening in financial conditions and a deterioration in market functioning, both globally and in the United Kingdom. Risky asset prices had continued to fall sharply. Earlier in March, this had been accompanied by declines in government bond yields. During the period leading up to 19 March, however, those yields had risen sharply, even as prices of risky assets had continued to decline. Measures of liquidity in government bond markets had deteriorated markedly. There had been additional demand for short-term assets, US dollar liquidity in particular. At the time of the MPC's special meeting on 19 March, major global equity indices had been around 10 to 20% lower than at the time of the special meeting ending on 10 March, and around 30% lower than at the time of the MPC's January meeting. Measures of equity market implied volatility, such as the VIX, had picked up from already elevated levels to reach all-time highs. Both investment-grade and high-yield corporate bond spreads had widened markedly further in all major currencies, although they had remained lower than the levels reached during the global financial crisis. Advanced economy government bond yields, which typically fall when risk appetite weakens, had increased sharply in the period between the special meetings ending on 10 and on 19 March. Ten-year government bond yields had picked up by around 40 to 50 basis points in the United States, the euro area and the United Kingdom. US Treasury markets, which were normally highly liquid, had seen significant volatility, with a notable widening in bid-offer spreads. US dollar commercial paper funding markets had been highly stressed. Market contacts indicated that many investors had sought to move their portfolio holdings away from risky assets and government bonds and into cash, particularly US dollars. This had led to a sharp appreciation of the dollar, which had been around 7 1/2 % higher than at the time of the MPC's January meeting, and a depreciation of other major currencies, including sterling. Conditions in foreign exchange swap markets had become stressed, with investors' demand for dollar funding very high, and dealers stepping back from intermediating in some markets. Those effects had been exacerbated by operational constraints, as firms implemented contingency plans to mitigate the effects of the virus. Conditions in the UK gilt market had deteriorated notably and gilt yields had risen sharply in the run-up to the special meeting on 19 March. Coupled with the falls in risky asset prices, there had been a material tightening in UK financial conditions, despite sterling having fallen sharply. UK banks' funding costs had picked up further, broadly in line with their international peers. Spreads in wholesale unsecured funding markets, which were now largely closed, had exceeded their post-EU referendum peak. Bank CDS spreads and option- adjusted spreads on UK banks' additional Tier 1 issuance had also risen further, and major UK banks' equity prices had fallen again. At its special meeting on 19 March, the MPC announced a policy package including an additional PS200 billion of asset purchases. That, alongside announcements from HM Treasury on 20 March of further targeted assistance to businesses, including salary guarantees, had helped to improve sentiment in sterling markets. Immediately following the MPC's announcement on 19 March, gilt yields had fallen, the yield curve had flattened and sterling had risen a little. Conditions in the gilt market had calmed, although repo and money markets had continued to be disrupted, with the Libor-OIS spread falling slightly but remaining elevated. There had also been significant policy announcements in other countries recently. Amongst other measures, on 15 March, the Federal Reserve had announced a further cut of 100 basis points in the target range for the federal funds rate and additional purchases of US Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities. This had been followed by new facilities to support commercial paper funding on 17 March, and money market mutual fund liquidity on 19 March, which were both expanded on 23 March. Also on 23 March, the Federal Reserve had announced further, open-ended asset purchases, alongside programmes to support lending to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), bond and loan issuance by larger corporates, and the issuance of asset-backed securities. The ECB had announced additional asset purchases and further long-term repo operations on 12 March, and a new temporary pandemic emergency purchase programme for private and public sector bonds on 18 March. Several major central banks had in mid-March announced co-ordinated action to enhance the provision of liquidity via US dollar liquidity swap line arrangements, including widening the countries involved and increasing the frequency of operations. In addition, fiscal authorities around the world had announced significant measures designed to support companies, workers and the economy more broadly. In particular, it appeared likely that the US Congress would agree a large fiscal stimulus package. By the time of the MPC's meeting ending on 25 March, and in part reflecting these global policy actions, equity prices had picked up, corporate bond spreads had stabilised, and there were tentative signs of improvement in some measures of market functioning in fixed income markets, particularly in the United States. However, market contacts reported that conditions nevertheless remained fragile, even in the typically most liquid instruments. The international economy Timely data and surveys of international activity released since the Committee's special meeting ending on 10 March had continued to suggest that a very sharp reduction in global economic activity was underway. Covid-19 had continued to spread rapidly across economies, prompting governments worldwide to take public health measures that would have significant economic impacts. Authorities had taken measures including restrictions on national and international travel, school closures, the cancellation of public events and social distancing more generally. These measures were already having a marked effect on economic activity. As a result, it was probable that global GDP would fall sharply during the first half of this year, although there would be a rebound at some stage thereafter, depending in part on how long the social distancing measures remained in place. Covid-19 had initially impacted the Chinese economy, and data had been particularly weak there. Industrial production had fallen by 13.5% on a year ago in the joint January-February data, the largest fall since the series began in 1990. Retail sales had recorded the largest fall ever in the joint January-February data, down by over 17% compared to the same period a year earlier. The urban-surveyed unemployment rate had risen by almost 1 percentage point relative to the previous month, to 6.2%. Recent data, including labour migration statistics and passenger traffic, had suggested some improvement from the trough in February, however. The disease had also had a marked impact in the euro area, most notably in Italy, where a variety of indicators of economic activity had fallen very sharply. The euro-area flash composite output PMI for March had fallen materially, by 20 points to 31, with a particularly pronounced fall in the services index. Supply chains had been disrupted, with supplier delivery times rising further. In the United States, supplier delivery times had also lengthened. Leisure-related spending had slowed materially. There had been a sharp rise in new unemployment insurance claims in the week ending 14 March, driven by the states of California and Washington, with signs of an even larger rise in the following week. Internet searches for terms relating to unemployment benefit had risen sharply in a number of countries, consistent with the impact of the spread of the virus now broadening to the labour market. The US Markit composite flash PMI for March had fallen by 9 points to 41, with a particularly pronounced fall in the services index. The deterioration in risk sentiment had affected emerging markets too. There had been capital outflows, a depreciation of these currencies against the dollar and a broader tightening in financial conditions in many of these economies. Spot oil prices had fallen further, to $27 per barrel, mainly reflecting the weakness of global demand. That compared with $37 at the time of the special MPC meeting ending on 10 March, and $62 at the time of the . Current economic conditions Since the MPC's special meeting ending on 10 March, UK survey data had begun to reflect the impact of before the more restrictive social distancing measures had been announced by the Government. The flash composite output and expectation indices had nonetheless fallen very sharply, to all-time lows. This was consistent with a steep fall in output in March. Given the more restrictive measures introduced on 23 March, it was likely that economic activity would contract significantly further in April and in 2020 Q2 as a whole. The latest indicators also pointed to a marked deterioration in labour market conditions. The IHS Markit flash composite employment index fell to a level that was consistent with a fall in employment. Around 90% of recruiters responding to a REC survey conducted on 13 March thought that Covid-19 would have an adverse impact on hiring activities in the short-term. In the March IHS Markit Household Finance survey, the job security perceptions index had fallen to its lowest level for over eight years. The Department for Work and Pensions had reported a marked rise in claims for Universal Credit, and internet searches for terms relating to unemployment and redundancy had picked up sharply. Given lags in official data, Bank staff had been monitoring closely other timely indicators of activity. These had indicated sharp falls in consumer spending in recent weeks. Restaurant bookings, spending in cinemas and footfall in the hospitality sector had all fallen substantially as a result of social distancing. In total, social activities comprised one fifth of consumer spending. Spending in the UK was also likely to be reduced by consumers delaying purchases of durable goods, such as cars, and by a marked fall in spending by foreign tourists as a result of restrictions on travel around the world. The Bank's Agents reported that the fall in output had become much more widespread since the MPC's special meeting ending on 10 March. Activity was falling rapidly in many sectors due to a combination of economic uncertainty, supply-chain disruption, travel restrictions and social distancing. Many contacts had suffered cashflow problems as revenues had fallen and had responded by reducing operations and working hours to save costs. There was some evidence of redundancies, although early reports suggested that the Government's Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme would help to prevent some job losses that might otherwise have occurred. Demand for short-term credit had increased, although some companies reported that credit availability had tightened. Housing market activity had declined sharply as uncertainty and social distancing measures had deterred buyers and sellers. that many businesses expected Covid-19 to have a large negative impact on sales over the next year. Businesses in the leisure and tourism, accommodation and food, and transport and storage sectors were expected to be the most severely affected. Covid-19 had created significant uncertainty for businesses, with around half of respondents saying that it was the most important source of uncertainty they faced. The near-term outlook for inflation was lower than at the time of the MPC's special meeting ending on 10 March. The recent additional fall in the oil price would feed through to lower fuel prices, while the Budget had also included a freeze in duties on fuel and alcohol. As a result, CPI inflation was likely to fall below 1% in 2020 Q2, which would require the Governor to write a letter to the Chancellor. The immediate policy decisions The MPC sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and thereby helps to sustain growth and employment. In that context, its challenge over recent weeks had been to respond to the severe economic and financial disruption caused by the spread of Covid-19. CPI inflation had been 1.7% in February. Prior to recent developments, inflation had already been set to fall further below the MPC's 2% target. It was now likely to decline to below 1% in the spring, reflecting the pass-through to fuel prices of the recent and sharp decline in the oil price. Further ahead, inflation would be boosted by the significant depreciation of the sterling exchange rate. The MPC would be monitoring closely developments in inflation and in indicators of inflation expectations, including those of households, businesses and financial markets. Financial market measures of inflation expectations had not risen over recent weeks. The Committee noted that, owing to the impact the spread of Covid-19 would have on household spending patterns and the ability of the ONS to collect price data, the construction of the CPI beyond March could become more challenging, and the index might be less representative of spending patterns, for a period. Bank staff and the ONS would continue to liaise on these issues. The nature of the economic shock from Covid-19 was very different from those to which the MPC had previously had to respond. The scale and duration of the shock to economic activity, while highly uncertain, would be large and sharp but should ultimately prove temporary, particularly if job losses and business failures could be minimised. In the current circumstances, and consistent with the MPC's remit, monetary policy was aimed at guarding against an unwarranted tightening in financial conditions and, more broadly, supporting businesses and households through the crisis and limiting any lasting damage to the economy. In the period between the MPC's previous special meeting ending on 10 March and the special MPC meeting on 19 March, the spread of Covid-19 and the measures that were likely to be needed to contain the virus had evolved significantly. At its special meeting on 19 March, the Committee focused on: recent dislocations in financial markets; the consequent tightening in financial conditions; and the scope of any additional monetary policy response, having regard for the actions of the Bank of England and UK Government since the MPC's previous special meeting. In the days leading up to the special MPC meeting on 19 March, UK and global financial conditions had tightened significantly further. In common with a number of other advanced economy bond markets, conditions in the UK gilt market had deteriorated substantially as investors had sought shorter-dated instruments that were closer substitutes for highly liquid central bank reserves. Corporate bond spreads had also widened materially. Volatility in stock markets had risen to historically elevated levels and equity prices had fallen significantly further. Sterling had depreciated sharply. As a consequence, all major central banks had set out wide-ranging policy responses. There was little evidence as yet to assess the magnitude of the economic shock from Covid-19. The MPC nevertheless judged that activity had fallen materially in both the global and domestic economy over recent weeks and would remain at or below that weakened level in the immediate period ahead. The Budget on 11 March had included a range of fiscal support measures on which the MPC had been briefed by the HM Treasury representative ahead of the special MPC meeting ending on 10 March. the Federal Reserve, and the Swiss National Bank had announced a coordinated action to enhance the provision of liquidity via the standing US dollar liquidity swap line arrangements. These swap lines were available standing facilities and served as an important liquidity backstop to ease strains in global funding markets. for which the Bank would act as HM Treasury's agent. The CCFF would provide funding to investment-grade businesses who were making a material contribution to the UK economy. It would do so by purchasing commercial paper of up to a one-year maturity. This would help businesses across a range of sectors to pay wages and suppliers, while experiencing severe disrupt","['covid', 'inflation', 'banking', 'monetary', 'pandemic']","['2020 monetary', 'covid 19', 'monetary policy', 'affected covid', 'crisis limiting']","['march 2020 monetary', 'covid 19 risks', 'covid 19 continued', 'affected covid 19', 'expected covid 19']","['special monetary policy committee meeting', 'monetary policy committee', 'monetary policy', 'additional monetary policy response', 'new temporary pandemic emergency purchase programme']"
3240,r220929c_ECB,euro area,2022-09-29,Building on our strengths: the role of the public and private sectors in the digital euro ecosystem ,panetta,0,"I am glad to be here for our quarterly exchange as we are about to start the second year of the investigation phase of our digital euro project. Over the past year we have already discussed several key aspects together. In March we focused on the issue of privacy, the use cases for a digital euro and a possible offline functionality. And in June we considered how the digital euro could be designed to avoid it having a negative effect on financial stability. Following our exchanges with you and other stakeholders, which provided us with valuable input, the ECB's Governing Council has now endorsed a first set of foundational design choices that cover these issues. In particular, we will explore options that could allow the digital euro to replicate some cash-like features and enable greater privacy for low-value transactions. Moreover, limit and remuneration-based tools will be embedded in the design of a digital euro to avoid an excessive use as a form of investment. We can now proceed with the analysis of further design choices. We will review the overall design of a possible digital euro next year, once all choices have been made. I must stress that the Governing Council's approval of this first set of design choices has no bearing on whether or not we decide to move to the realisation phase - a decision that is likely to be made in October next year. It also has no bearing on whether or not we ultimately decide to issue a digital euro. Throughout the remainder of the investigation phase, I will continue to hold regular hearings with this Committee. I will do so in parallel to your legislative discussions about a regulation to establish the digital euro, which the European Commission plans to propose in the first quarter of next year. Today I would like to discuss two topics with you. First, the role of the Eurosystem and private market participants in the digital euro ecosystem. And second, how we envisage the digital euro being distributed to its users. The combined efforts of the public and private sectors were key to building the European payment system we have today, which is one of the most efficient in the world. We now need to draw on this cooperation once again in order to build the digital euro ecosystem. This will ensure both that public money is made accessible in digital form and that innovative pan-European retail payment solutions can emerge. The Eurosystem has extensive experience in offering cash-like risk-free assets and providing the underlying payment infrastructure. And the private sector has a wealth of expertise in distributing payment products and interacting with end users. We need to harness these strengths to generate synergies and satisfy the needs of users in a fast-changing payments landscape. Holding a digital euro would mean holding a direct liability of the central bank - as is the case with banknotes today. This means that digital euro would be on the balance sheet of the Eurosystem. And the Eurosystem would be liable for any mistake made in digital euro settlement. It is therefore of utmost importance that the Eurosystem retains full control over digital euro issuance and settlement. The best way to achieve this is to have the Eurosystem performing the settlement activities for the intermediaries that distribute the digital euro to end users. This is fully consistent with the objective of safeguarding the privacy of end users. We can design the digital euro to ensure that the Eurosystem only processes data to settle transactions with no possibility to track payments sent or received by any specific user. Strict segregation of data between intermediaries and the Eurosystem, as well as privacy-enhancing techniques, would ensure that the Eurosystem cannot link any visible data to the identity of a digital euro user. The fact that settlement is performed by the Eurosystem does not imply that we would manage the accounts of users. The digital euro accounts and the associated payment operations would be offered and operated by private intermediaries, as is currently the case for the bank accounts and services that customers are already used to. The Eurosystem could rely on either traditional or distributed ledger technology for settlement activities. We have not yet taken a decision about which technology would be best suited for a digital euro but, when we do, we will consider efficiency, safety and integration with customer-facing services, as well as the environmental impact. Over the past year, we have been investigating how to design a digital euro that meets the expectations of Europeans. Our investigation took into account detailed analyses of payment habits, insights from focus groups, and feedback from you and from key stakeholders. The intermediaries that would distribute the digital euro have in-depth knowledge and unique insights into what users need. They are thus best placed to be the direct counterparts for the individuals, merchants and businesses that would use the digital euro. These intermediaries would open accounts and wallets. They would conduct know your customer and anti-money laundering checks. And they would provide the devices or technology needed to pay in physical stores, online or person to person. For example, an app could be used for direct payments between two people, and an online interface could be used when shopping online. Our investigation of these devices and technologies - the so-called form factors - is ongoing. We will develop prototypes to explore a variety of user interface solutions for making payments with digital euro. This is a learning opportunity, and will contribute to our design analysis in the subsequent phases of the digital euro project. We expect to publish our results in the first quarter of next year. Intermediaries would also have a role to play in the funding and defunding of users' holdings in digital euro. Users could either fund their digital euro accounts or wallets with cash, or they could convert commercial bank money - that is, bank deposits - into digital euro. Conversely, they could convert digital euro into cash or move money from their digital euro account to their bank account. Finally, intermediaries will be responsible for transaction management tasks, in a similar manner to current payments. This means they will be responsible for initiating transactions in digital euro, as well as customer authentication and transaction validation. Let me now turn to how we could best distribute the digital euro. We want to ensure that everyone in the euro area would be able to pay and be paid in digital euro. This should be the case irrespective of the entity with which they open their digital euro account or wallet and the country they are from. We also want to make a digital euro available to people who currently have no or limited access to digital payments, in order to improve financial inclusion. And a digital euro should foster innovation in the payments market, enabling intermediaries to develop novel solutions rather than discouraging them or crowding them out. We have thoroughly investigated different distribution models, assessing them against the key objectives of our digital euro project. We have also examined what has worked well in the past when it comes to developing payment solutions covering the entire euro area - such as the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) project, which allows European consumers, businesses and public authorities to make and receive payments under the same conditions. We believe that a digital euro scheme - that is, a single set of rules, practices and standards - is best suited to achieve our objectives. A digital euro scheme would provide a common framework for euro area intermediaries to develop products and services built on a digital euro. It would establish a set of common operational rules and technical standards that intermediaries would need to follow in order to provide digital euro solutions to end users. And it would help create a specific brand so that, should the digital euro be introduced, people and businesses would know that they are paying with it. Thanks to that recognisable brand, a digital euro scheme would strengthen the role of the digital euro as a monetary anchor alongside cash. And thanks to the benefits in terms of standardisation and interoperability, the scheme would also support our strategic autonomy and economic efficiency. A digital euro scheme would respond to the different interests of different market participants - individuals, merchants, businesses and intermediaries. For individuals, it would mean that they have the same experience when making a payment no matter where they are in the euro area. They would be able to use digital euro in different settings, whether they are having dinner in a restaurant, buying something online or transferring money to a friend. For merchants and businesses, meeting customer demand is key. A digital euro scheme would provide a single standard, making it easier to respond to customers' preferences for a simple payment solution. Standardisation would also reduce adjustment costs and facilitate integration with merchants' back-end systems. And for intermediaries, the scheme would enable them to distribute the digital euro and to build on it to develop further innovative solutions for their customers. It would offer the standardisation and harmonisation needed to foster market innovation across the entire euro area. In this context, we will soon start work on a rulebook for the digital euro scheme. Putting in place a set of rules from an early stage is crucial for the market to be able to develop digital euro solutions and be ready if and when a digital euro is introduced. We will work together with different stakeholders - intermediaries, consumers and retailers - so that they can contribute their views and expertise as the scheme is being developed. Let me conclude. A well-designed digital euro would bring benefits for everyone. It would provide a payments solution for anyone needing to make or receive a payment. It would ensure that a standardised infrastructure is available to everyone. And it would serve as a strong foundation for intermediaries to offer payment services throughout the euro area, thereby fostering competition and innovation. Cooperation between the public and private sectors is crucial to make the digital euro a reality. The Eurosystem and the intermediaries involved will have a key role to play, drawing on their respective expertise. Successful cooperation will require a pricing strategy that provides adequate economic incentives to foster the adoption of the digital euro. We are currently analysing a possible compensation model for the digital euro, a topic that is also relevant for the European Commission. I stand ready to discuss this with you in the coming months, as well as other important aspects of the digital euro that we are currently investigating. I now look forward to your questions.","['euro', 'eurosystem', 'ecb', 'bank', 'european']","['digital euro', 'framework euro', 'eurosystem privacy', 'achieve eurosystem', 'ensure eurosystem']","['design digital euro', 'digital euro ecosystem', 'digital euro consider', 'develop digital euro', 'digital euro designed']","['digital euro ecosystem', 'digital euro project', 'digital euro solutions', 'digital euro issuance', 'digital euro scheme']"
6131,r220929a_BOE,united kingdom,2022-09-29,Recent developments in the economy and markets,pill,0,"Good evening everyone. It is a great pleasure to speak at tonight's annual dinner of the Institute of Directors in Northern Ireland. I owe thanks to Gordon Milligan and his IoD colleagues for their kind invitation. I would also like to thank my colleagues Frances Hill and Gillian Anderson from the Bank of England's Belfast Agency for putting together such a great agenda for my Northern Ireland visit. Many of you will know them as contacts of the Agency, feeding information about business developments and your own firms' situation into the Bank's decision making processes. Let me take this opportunity to thank you for all the time and effort you take to provide those insights. My colleagues on the MPC - as well as in other parts of the Bank - find this information invaluable in getting a timely read on the economy. At a time when we are faced with uncertainty on many dimensions, that timely read can strongly influence our thinking, our analysis and, ultimately, our policy decisions. The Bank's Belfast Agency was set up in the late 1990s to ensure that developments in Northern Ireland were fully embodied in the Bank's economic assessment. As a Welshman now working in Threadneedle Street, I appreciate that the Bank of England can appear a remote institution, apparently focused on the City of London and far away from the day-to-day concerns of people living elsewhere in the UK. The work of the Agencies provides a bridge between the Bank and the households, businesses and communities it serves. Through my discussions over the past couple of days, I have learnt about how Brexit has affected trading relationships on the island of Ireland and across the Irish Sea. And our Citizens Panel on the cost-of-living emphasised the distinctiveness of the retail energy market in Northern Ireland, which has been in focus of late given the sharp rises in utility bills. I am not going to discuss those issues this evening - although I realise that they are important, as well as politically and economically sensitive. I have been in listening mode, and can now take some of the lessons learnt back to our deliberations at the Bank. I originally hoped to spend the bulk of my time exploring the macroeconomic motivations underlying MPC decisions in the past few months. I hope to return to those issues in a moment. But given recent events and actions, it would be remiss of me not to address market developments. Over the course of the past week, there has be a significant repricing of financial assets. Part of that re-pricing reflects broader global developments. Part of it reflects the ongoing normalisation of macroeconomic policy after the pandemic-induced episode of exceptional ease. But there is undoubtedly a UK-specific component. As the Governor said in his statement on Monday afternoon, we are monitoring financial markets developments - and, in particular, that UK-specific component - very closely. Importantly, what we have seen in recent days is, to a large extent, indeed a re-pricing. When new information - such as a change to the medium-term outlook for fiscal policy - is released, one would expect the relevant assets - in this context, government bonds - to re-price. That is a healthy sign of a functioning financial market responding to fundamental news. The Bank obviously has an interest in maintaining orderly and well-functioning markets that support such healthy price formation. It also has a statutory responsibility for financial stability. The Bank takes that responsibility very seriously. Since I spoke earlier in the week, the Bank's staff and Financial Policy Committee (FPC) have identified a market segment where orderly re-pricing threatened to descend into market dysfunction: specifically, the long-end of the gilt market - where government bonds with maturities above 20 years trade. The reasons underlying these problems are complex. I am not going to address them here, and am anyway not the best-placed person to do so. While much effort has been made to deepen our understanding of and ability to respond to market dislocation since the global financial crisis, the emergence of these problems suggests the Bank and wider central banking community still have some work to do in throwing light on and building resilience in some of the shadow-ier parts of the non-bank financial sector, as emphasised by my colleagues on the FPC and internationally in the FSB. But that is for the future. Right now, we are dealing with the problems that pose an immediate threat. The intervention announced yesterday by the Bank is intended to facilitate an orderly adjustment in the positions and structures that were threatening to generate dysfunction in that market segment. By acting in the gilt market to facilitate the necessary reduction of leverage - or at least creating an environment where that reduction can take place - the Bank is preventing a self-sustaining vicious spiral of collateral calls, forced sales and disappearing liquidity from emerging in a core segment of the financial markets. Restoring market functioning helps reduce any risks from contagion to credit conditions for UK households and businesses. The intervention is targeted specifically at that market segment where problems were emerging. And it is time-limited, because the Bank buys assets in order to sell them on afterwards, thereby helping the orderly re-shuffling of holdings of and exposures to longer-dated gilts that needs to take place. These operations do not create central bank money on a lasting basis. As a result they will not shift the underlying macroeconomically-relevant monetary trends in the economy, which ultimately pin down developments in the price level. They are not intended to cap or control longer-term interest rates or to offer more favourable underlying financing conditions to the institutions involved - or, for that matter, to the Government - than would have prevailed in an orderly market environment. In the spirit of the famous Bagehot rule addressing the threat of bank deposit runs, yesterday's intervention is intended to prevent painful, adverse self-fulfilling market dynamics emerging. That is why yesterday's intervention is a ""temporary and targeted financial stability operation"". It is intended to allow the inevitable and necessary re-pricing of financial assets stemming from recent macroeconomic news - including last week's fiscal announcements - to take place in an orderly way. So yesterday's intervention was not a monetary policy operation. The temporary and targeted character of the Bank's intervention is key to the distinction between financial stability and monetary policy that I have emphasised here. With that in mind, let me now turn to the responsibilities of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), of which I am a member. The MPC will make a comprehensive assessment of the macroeconomic and monetary situation ahead of our next meeting in early November, before coming to a decision on the monetary policy stance. Hopefully, what I am about to say is self-evident. But in current circumstances it bears saying nevertheless. On the MPC, we are certainly not indifferent to the re-pricing of financial assets we have seen over the past few days. Indeed, we cannot be indifferent. For a small, open market economy like the UK, changes in asset prices have an important impact on macro developments though a variety of channels: via the cost of financing; via the cost of imports; and via their impact on both aggregate demand and aggregate supply. We need to factor the impact of asset price changes through all these channels into our overall assessment of the economic outlook and prospects for price developments. That forms the basis on which we formulate policy decisions to reach the 2% inflation target. This is the lens through which the MPC has viewed, and will view, recent market developments. Because I can assure you that the MPC has a very good understanding of both its mandate - to maintain price stability - and of its remit - to return inflation back to target. As I think - or at least hope - is widely recognised, the past year has proved to be a challenging time for monetary policy makers. And, to be frank, recent market developments have created their own, additional challenges. But, despite these challenges, the MPC's commitment to achieving its target is unwavering. In pursuit of the inflation target, the MPC employs monetary policy - changes in Bank Rate - to steer aggregate demand in the UK economy around the trends in aggregate supply, so as to relieve current inflationary pressures. The relevance of recent market developments to our monetary policy decisions stems from how those developments influence our efforts to come to an appropriate balance between demand and supply. But crucially, the impact of market developments has to be seen in the context of all the other important macroeconomic influences on demand and supply, including the impact of fiscal measures announced by the Government in the past few weeks, as well as developments in energy prices and labour markets that my colleagues and I have discussed in the past. The vehicle for making that necessarily comprehensive assessment is our MPC forecast. The process of producing that forecast ahead of the MPC's next scheduled meeting in early November is already well underway. That assessment will need to embody recent evidence of weakness in economic activity, as well as the impact of the Government's Energy Price Guarantee on headline inflation and wage and price setting behaviour. It will have to factor in the evolution of international commodity prices, not least developments in wholesale natural gas markets. And it will need to assess the impact of the Government's Growth Plan and other fiscal announcements in detail. I don't have time to discuss all that this evening. But, one thing I would flag is that, on my read, recent fiscal announcements will, on balance, provide a stimulus to demand relative to supply in the short to medium term. We will come to our more complete assessment in November. But I recognise that, as of today, November might seem a long time away. For algorithmic traders, even nanoseconds can represent a long time. The media or political cycle operates over a matter of hours. And, as we saw yesterday, acting to sustain orderly markets may also require action at short order. But monetary policy needs to be framed on a more considered or lower frequency basis, reflecting both the famously 'long and variable lags' in the transmission of monetary policy to price developments, as well as the need to distinguish signal from noise in the flow of incoming data and analysis. So the following question arises: if we need to wait for November for our comprehensive assessment, what happens in the meantime? During the intervening period, we need to rely on our communication about the economic and policy outlook through remarks like these, and its transmission to market developments, the real economy and wage and price setting behaviour, via market participants' expectations. That process, in turn, relies on the underlying macro and market institutional framework. Essential to maintaining a credible and stable institutional framework within which the Bank's monetary policy can operate effectively are: clearly defined responsibilities; clearly identified objectives; and respect for institutional independence. In that context, the Treasury's announcement of a clear timetable for the clarification of its new fiscal rules, as well as its preparedness to submit its policy plans to the independent, external scrutiny of the Office for Budget Responsibility is to be welcomed. These considerations also point to the importance of distinguishing between the Bank's financial stability operation implemented yesterday, and the Bank's conduct of monetary policy by the MPC. I sought to emphasise that distinction earlier. So to conclude, let me sum up by describing where we stand. I speak here as an individual. I do not represent the views of the MPC as a whole. And, of course, my assessment this evening is conditional on the situation as it stands today. We live in rapidly moving times. As events unfold, assessments need to be updated. But, at present, on the basis of the fiscal easing announced last week, the macroeconomic policy environment looks set to rebalance. Taken in conjunction with the macroeconomic impact of ensuing market developments, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the fiscal easing announced last week will prompt a significant and necessary monetary policy response in November. The views expressed in this speech are not necessarily those of the Bank of England or the Monetary Policy Committee. The responsibility for all remaining errors is my own.","['banking', 'bank', 'belfast', 'welshman', 'ireland']","['bank belfast', 'belfast agency', 'bank england', 'bank decision', 'bank information']","['bank belfast agency', 'bank england belfast', 'decisions bank belfast', 'england belfast agency', 'bank england appear']","['belfast agency', 'northern ireland visit', 'bank', 'northern ireland', 'wider central banking community']"
3238,r220929a_ECB,euro area,2022-09-29,Natura finis magistra – acknowledging nature-related risks to make finance thrive,elderson,0,"The translation of the full Latin name of Artis Zoo, founded back in 1838 as ""Natura Artis Magistra"", is ""Nature is the teacher of the arts"". Today, nature has something to say to all of us: it is hurting. And we are responsible for that hurt. Human activities are behind the decline in natural capital, the reduced capacity to provide ecosystem services and the loss of biodiversity. What's more, we are putting at risk more than half of global GDP. Around EUR40 trillion of global income relies on nature. This means that nature-related risks, including those associated with biodiversity loss, could have significant macroeconomic implications. Failure to account for, mitigate and adapt to these implications is a source of risk for individual financial institutions and for financial stability. In a nutshell, this forms part of our mandate, as acknowledged by the NGFS in its statement on nature-related risks released in March 2022. The final report by the NGFS/INSPIRE joint Study Group referred to in this statement carefully explains how environmental degradation will expose financial institutions to physical and transition risks in a way that is very similar to climate change. In spite of this, we have to admit that central banks, supervisors, regulators and international standard setting bodies have so far made less progress in integrating environmental risks than climate-related risks. Although the analytical framework for climate-related risks is largely applicable to environmental risks, the latter come with their own unique features and challenges. For example, biodiversity does not have an unequivocal metric like carbon dioxide equivalents, which figure prominently in climate discussions. We therefore need to look at many more metrics, such as nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon dioxide. Let me emphasise ""look at more"", not ""look away"". Since we have explicitly recognised the materiality of nature-related financial risks, it is no longer a matter of principle that the work on environmental risks is less advanced than the work on climate. It is a matter of putting it into practice. And it is clear that we can no longer drag out feet with putting-it-into-practice. Here an important contribution will be made by the new NGFS task force on nature-related risks that will be led by Saskia de Vries from De Nederlandsche Bank and Sylvie Goulard from the Banque de France. Both representatives from institutions that have done pioneering work on nature-related risks. At the ECB the work on environmental risks is already starting to take shape in our banking supervision. In 2020 we published our guide on our supervisory expectations for the risk management of C&E risks. Indeed, C-and-E: climate-related and environmental risks. In this guide, we explicitly recognised that environmental factors related to the loss of ecosystem services, such as water stress, biodiversity loss and resource scarcity have also been shown to drive financial risk. We therefore expect banks to evaluate all environmental risk-related information beyond just climate risks to ensure that their risk management is all encompassing. When we asked banks last year to evaluate their own risk management practices in relation to our expectations, we found that some of them had already started to identify and manage risks beyond those that are just climate-related. However, very few banks back then had actually begun to implement these practices and we made them aware of this gap with regards to our supervisory expectations. As part of this year's thematic review on climate-related and environmental risks, we followed up on these points, focusing on banks' assessments of the materiality of environmental risks and on their risk management frameworks. Our preliminary results show that many banks have by now made an initial assessment of their environmental risk exposures. We also see that banks are using the ""climate risk playbook"" to develop their approach to environmental risk. They map out physical and transition risk drivers and typically start by excluding some activities to avoid financing those that have an excessive environmental impact. Banks also integrate these risks into their due diligence processes to collect information and gain a better understanding of how their clients might be affected. Besides these qualitative approaches, several institutions are leading the way in quantifying the risks and impacts through the use of biodiversity footprinting exercises and the development of approaches for biodiversity scores. We welcome this progress and will use the opportunity to share the best practices we have identified when we will soon publish the results of the thematic review. At the same time, we will reiterate that all banks must ultimately comply with all of our supervisory expectations on C&E risks by the end of 2024 at the latest. With respect to our monetary policy, the ECB is currently fully on track implementing the climate action plan that we committed to when we introduced our new monetary policy strategy in the summer of last year. To give you a concrete example, last week we announced the details of how we intend to gradually decarbonise our corporate bond holdings, starting on next Monday, in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement. At the same time, it is important to remember that our climate action plan is not an aim in itself but rather a means for us to deliver on our mandate. That's why the Governing Council announced in July that it would regularly review the measures proposed in its action plan to assess whether they are still fit for purpose, and continue to support the decarbonisation path towards reaching the goals under the Paris Agreement, as well as the EU climate neutrality objectives. And not only this. Something that is clearly relevant for us and this conference is that we will adapt these measures if necessary to address other environmental risks within our mandate. Expressing a readiness to look beyond climate-related risks and address environmental risks is an important initial step that I invite all relevant stakeholders to take. That applies to central banks, supervisors, regulators and international standard setting bodies. Even if the current focus of the ongoing work is still on climate-related risks, our ever-evolving understanding of the materiality of environmental risks and their transmission channels implies that these risks ultimately need to be taken into consideration in everything we do. Let me conclude. For the first time in 75 years the Artis Groote Museum - where this conference is held - reopened its doors this spring. The theme of the museum is that everything is connected: plants, animals, microbes and human beings, all in a precious but delicate harmony. Economics and finance are no different. Taken together, households, firms, governments and financial institutions form a similarly precious - and at times delicate - equilibrium. Our analysis, assessment and policy actions should reflect the fact that nature and the economy are equally interconnected and interdependent. In line with a central theme of the landmark Dasgupta Review on the economics of biodiversity that ""humanity is embedded in nature"". Back to ""Natura artis magistra"". Nature isn't just the teacher of the arts, it is also the teacher of finance. One may be inclined to paraphrase: ""natura finis magistra"". In fact, nature makes finance thrive. This is what ultimately needs to become fully embedded in the work of central banks, supervisors, regulators and international standard setting bodies, within their mandate. Because nature-related risks are part of our mandate. Thank you for your attention.","['ecosystem', 'environmental', 'biodiversity', 'risk', 'nature']","['environmental risk', 'nature economy', 'provide ecosystem', 'economics biodiversity', 'environmental risks']","['nature related financial', 'biodiversity putting risk', 'nature makes finance', 'ecosystem services loss', 'economics biodiversity humanity']","['environmental risk', 'environmental risks', 'financial risks', 'other environmental risks', 'environmental degradation']"
3239,r220929b_ECB,euro area,2022-09-29,"Policy mix of the future: the role of monetary, fiscal and macroprudential policies",guindos,0,"I am very pleased to participate in this conference to mark the centenary of Lietuvos bankas. Building on the ECB's recent strategy review and our reflections on the policy mix, I will outline my views on the interplay between monetary, macroprudential and fiscal policy. Academic research points to the need for monetary and fiscal policy to work together in times of crisis. This runs contrary to previous wisdom suggesting fiscal policy should mainly support economic outcomes by playing the role of an ""automatic stabiliser."" For example, in recessions, government expenditure would automatically increase and tax revenue would automatically decrease. It has become evident that strong, discretionary countercyclical fiscal policy is needed in a crisis. Furthermore, research shows fiscal policy is particularly effective close to the lower bound of interest rates. In this way, fiscal policy not only effectively stabilises the economy, but also contributes to the ECB's objective of maintaining price stability. Structural fiscal policy could also help raise the natural or equilibrium real rate of interest . This rate of interest has been falling in recent decades and has made the pursuit of price stability much more challenging for central banks. Complementarity between monetary and fiscal policy was greatly effective following a long period of too low inflation. But how is this interaction in an inflationary environment? Or more generally, how does the level of inflation affect the fiscal-monetary policy mix? Macroprudential policy addresses risks to financial stability. Our strategy review acknowledges that financial stability is a necessary condition for price stability. With an impaired transmission mechanism in times of financial turmoil, maintaining price stability is not possible. At the same time, monetary policy itself can have implications for financial stability. Accommodative monetary policy can reduce credit risk and prevent debt deflation. But it could also trigger excessive risk taking or encourage higher leverage in the financial system. In times of monetary policy tightening, the converse arguments apply. We therefore decided to implement a new integrated analytical framework, which takes financial stability considerations explicitly into account in our monetary policy decisions. Our focus is threefold: detecting impairments to the transmission mechanism, such as fragmentation risk, monitoring a possible build-up of financial imbalances, and identifying how far macroprudential policy addresses financial imbalances. Let me summarise how I see the complementarities between fiscal and macroprudential policies with monetary policy: Fiscal and macroprudential policy should be the first lines of defence for economic stabilisation and fostering financial stability, respectively. This leaves monetary policy to focus exclusively on price stability. The importance of both fiscal and macroprudential policy has recently increased. Fiscal policy became more important because of its role in times of crises, and its enhanced effectiveness at the lower bound. Macroprudential policy became more relevant given its capacity to contain the potential side effects of monetary policy - both in the accommodative and tightening phases. Both fiscal and macroprudential policy need to be strongly countercyclical: this entails building up ""buffers"" during good times for use in bad times. While sovereign debt must be sustainable to be used countercyclically, macroprudential capital buffers need to first be built up so that they can be released when risks materialise. In the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), both fiscal and macroprudential policy can be targeted at the country, sector or industry level. They can therefore account for heterogeneity within EMU by alleviating the occasional one-size-fits-all problem. Thus, both fiscal and macroprudential policy can support monetary policy in its aim to achieve price stability. In the same way, successful monetary policy supports economic stabilisation and financial stability. All three policies have the potential to be mutually complementary in their respective fields of responsibility. The recent pandemic crisis and the current challenges of soaring energy and commodity prices coupled with high overall inflation have underlined the case for these policy complementarities. The successful interplay between accommodative monetary policy, fiscal support measures and prudential relief safeguarded the real economy and the financial system across the euro area during the pandemic crisis. It succeeded in protecting nominal incomes, thereby supporting a fast recovery of demand when our economies reopened. Subsequently, to combat steadily rising inflation, in December 2021 we started normalising our monetary policy by announcing the end of our asset purchases, in tandem with targeted fiscal measures aimed at mitigating the hardship of soaring prices for the most vulnerable households and firms. The scope and nature of fiscal measures needs to be different now than it was at the height of the pandemic, following a long period of too low inflation. Fiscal policy should not stoke inflation. It needs to be temporary and tailored to the most vulnerable households and businesses, who are being hardest hit by high inflation. The Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI) was introduced in July 2022. It aims to ensure that the monetary policy stance is transmitted smoothly across all euro area countries. The TPI therefore supports price stability while safeguarding financial stability by addressing unwarranted, disorderly market dynamics. At the same time, certain euro area countries are applying macroprudential policy for a targeted build-up of resilience. This targeted build-up of capital buffers and the application of borrower-based measures takes into account heterogeneous cyclical developments across countries and sectors in the euro area. It fine-tunes the overall policy mix and complements the single monetary policy in support of overall financial stability across the euro area. Despite the overall good resilience of the euro area banking sector, certain countries have in recent years seen a build-up of financial vulnerabilities, notably related to residential real estate prices and growing household and firm indebtedness. Some further careful and targeted tightening of macroprudential policy would be beneficial in selected countries at present. Given the deteriorated outlook for economic growth, some countries might benefit from further increasing the resilience of their financial sectors before credit risks start materialising. This includes for example taking measures to preserve capital in the banking sector which could then be used to absorb losses. Lithuania has been active in applying a comprehensive set of macroprudential policies to address current vulnerabilities. This year, authorities have activated a sectoral systemic risk buffer of 2% on residential real estate exposures and have tightened the loan-to-value limit for second and subsequent housing loans to 70%. Of course, the benefits of further policy action across countries, would need to be evaluated against the risk of procyclical effects, which is becoming more likely as the economic outlook worsens. Let me conclude. Policy interaction has been a critical element for navigating the pandemic. Complementary actions of fiscal, macroprudential and monetary policy, in their respective fields of responsibility, continue to be essential in dealing with the current inflation shock and financial system imbalances. In the current challenging macro-financial environment, macroprudential buffers contribute to preserving and strengthening banking sector resilience. Hence, I very much welcome that some national authorities - in close collaboration with the ECB - currently assess the extent to which there is merit in implementing additional macroprudential measures. The macroprudential policy response should consider the current near-term headwinds to economic growth since policy tightening should not result in an unintended tightening of credit conditions. Interactions between monetary and macroprudential policy become even more pronounced in a monetary union where monetary policy, by definition, will be focusing on area-wide economic and financial conditions. In fact, macroprudential policy targeting imbalances building up at national level within the monetary union can help to achieve better policy outcomes in terms of price and financial stability.","['fiscal', 'inflationary', 'monetary', 'recessions', 'banking']","['monetary fiscal', 'fiscal monetary', 'fiscal policy', 'policy fiscal', 'inflation fiscal']","['monetary fiscal policy', 'fiscal monetary policy', 'monetary policy fiscal', 'monetary macroprudential fiscal', 'fiscal macroprudential monetary']","['discretionary countercyclical fiscal policy', 'structural fiscal policy', 'fiscal policy', 'monetary policy stance', 'monetary policy']"
7680,r220930b_FOMC,united states,2022-09-30,Global Financial Stability Considerations for Monetary Policy in a High-Inflation Environment,brainard,0,"I want to start by thanking Anna Kovner, Rochelle Edge, and Bill Bassett for organizing this conference. The current global environment highlights the importance of having strong analytic and empirical foundations to understand financial stability considerations for monetary policy, and the research presented today will help strengthen those foundations. The global environment of high inflation and rising interest rates highlights the importance of paying attention to financial stability considerations for monetary policy. As monetary policy tightens globally to combat high inflation, it is important to consider how cross-border spillovers and spillbacks might interact with financial vulnerabilities. Inflation is very high in the United States and abroad, and the risk of additional inflationary shocks cannot be ruled out. In August, CPI (consumer price index) inflation on a Central banks facing high inflation are tightening monetary policy rapidly to damp demand and bring it into alignment with supply, which is constrained in a variety of sectors. The process of resolving imbalances will be easier the more supply improves in markets for commodities, labor, and key intermediate inputs, as is generally expected, but there is a risk that supply disruptions could be prolonged or aggravated by Russia's war against Ukraine, COVID-19 lockdowns in China, or weather disruptions. Russia's war against Ukraine has generated spikes in prices for energy, food, and agricultural inputs. Most recently, inflation in Europe was pushed higher by Russia's cessation of natural gas deliveries through the Nord  Stream 1 pipeline, creating hardships for households and risking disruptions for some industries in the affected countries. China's COVID lockdown policy could also lead to supply disruptions if cases again increase. Separately, weather conditions in several areas, including China, Europe, and the United States, are exacerbating price pressures through disruptions to agriculture, shipping, and utilities. Many central banks around the world have pivoted monetary policy strongly in order to maintain anchored expectations and forestall second-round effects from high inflation becoming embedded in wage and price setting. In the United States, the Federal Reserve has increased the federal funds rate target range by 300 basis points in the past seven months--a rapid pace by historical standards--and the Federal Open Market Committee's most recent Summary of Economic Projections indicates additional increases through the end of this year and into next year. In addition, beginning this month, balance sheet shrinkage accelerated to its maximum rate of up to $60 billion in Treasury securities per month, and up to $35 billion in agency mortgage- backed securities per month. Broader U.S. financial conditions have tightened rapidly: The 10- year Treasury yield has risen more than 200 basis points since the beginning of the year and is near its highest level in over a decade at 3.8 percent. At a global level, monetary policy tightening is also proceeding at a rapid pace by historical standards. Including the Federal Reserve, nine central banks in advanced economies accounting for half of global GDP have raised rates by 125 basis points or more in the past six months. Global financial conditions have likewise tightened. Yields on 10-year sovereign debt  in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the largest euro area economies are higher year to date between 170 and 350 basis points. It will take some time for the global tightening to have its full effect in many sectors. While the effect on financial conditions tends to be immediate or even anticipatory, the effects on activity and price setting in different sectors may occur with a lag, with highly interest- sensitive sectors such as housing adjusting quickly and less rate-sensitive sectors such as consumer spending on services adjusting more slowly. In addition to the domestic effects from domestic tightening, there are cross-border effects of tightening through both trade and financial channels. U.S. monetary policy tightening reduces U.S. demand for foreign products, thus amplifying the effects of monetary tightening by foreign central banks. The same is true in reverse: Tightening in large jurisdictions abroad amplifies U.S. tightening by damping foreign demand for U.S. products. Tightening in financial conditions similarly spills over to financial conditions elsewhere, which amplifies the tightening effects. These spillovers across jurisdictions are present for decreases in the size of the central bank balance sheet as well as for increases in the policy rate. Some estimates suggest that the spillovers of monetary policy surprises between more tightly linked advanced economies such as the United States and Europe could be about half the size of  the own-country effect when measured in terms of relative changes in local currency bond yields. In contrast, spillovers through exchange rate channels tend to go in opposite directions. The Federal Reserve's broad nominal U.S. dollar index has appreciated over 10 percent year to date. On balance, dollar appreciation tends to reduce import prices in the United States. But in some other jurisdictions, the corresponding currency depreciation may contribute to inflationary pressures and require additional tightening to offset. We are attentive to financial vulnerabilities that could be exacerbated by the advent of additional adverse shocks. For instance, in countries where sovereign or corporate debt levels are high, higher interest rates could increase debt-servicing burdens and concerns about debt sustainability, which could be exacerbated by currency depreciation. An increase in risk premiums could kick off deleveraging dynamics as financial intermediaries de-risk. And shallow liquidity in some markets could become an amplification channel in the event of further adverse shocks. For some emerging economies, high interest rates in combination with weaker demand in advanced economies could increase capital outflow pressures, particularly commodity importers facing higher commodity prices and weaker exchange rates. And these pressures would be  particularly challenging for borrowers with currency mismatches between their assets and liabilities. This is especially true at times when fiscal, macroprudential, and monetary buffers are more limited. Fiscal and monetary policy were both supportive in response to the pandemic, and both were naturally expected to reverse course as the recovery gathered steam. But the advent of the war has led to a significant hit to real incomes from large price increases in energy and other commodities in some of the most severely affected economies. With respect to macroprudential buffers, nearly all of the jurisdictions that built countercyclical capital buffers before the pandemic released those buffers at the outset of the pandemic, and the buffers have not been fully replenished so far. A European Central Bank analysis concluded that the release of capital buffers increased headroom for banks relative to not only their regulatory thresholds, but also their internal risk controls, and enabled banks to continue providing credit to households and businesses. And of course, monetary policy is focused on restoring price stability in a high-inflation environment. As the program's first research paper illustrates, in circumstances in which macroprudential policy cannot on its own eliminate the amplification of shocks through financial vulnerabilities, in a low-inflation environment, monetary policy has been relatively more accommodative than would be prescribed by a conventional monetary policy rule in order to reduce the likelihood of adverse output and employment outcomes. But in a high-inflation  environment, monetary policy is restrictive to restore price stability and maintain anchored inflation expectations. The Federal Reserve's policy deliberations are informed by analysis of how U.S. developments may affect the global financial system and how foreign developments in turn affect the U.S. economic outlook and risks to the financial system. We engage in frequent and transparent communications with monetary policy officials from other countries about the evolution of the outlook in each economy and the implications for policy. We meet regularly not only with monetary policy officials from different countries, but also with fiscal and financial stability officials in a variety of international settings, which helps us to take into account cross- border spillovers and financial vulnerabilities in our respective forecasts, risk scenarios, and policy deliberations. High inflation imposes significant hardships by eroding purchasing power, especially for those households that spend the greatest share of their incomes on essentials like food, housing, and transportation. Following a period where a combination of high demand and a lengthy sequence of adverse supply shocks to goods, labor, and commodities drove inflation to multidecade highs, monetary policymakers are taking a risk-management posture to guard against risks of longer-term inflation expectations moving above target, which would make it more difficult to bring inflation down.  In the modal outlook, monetary policy tightening to temper demand, in combination with improvements in supply, is expected to reduce demand-supply imbalances and reduce inflation over time. The real yield curve is now in solidly positive territory at all but the very shortest maturities, and with the additional tightening and deceleration in inflation that is expected over coming quarters, the entire real curve will soon move into positive territory. It will take time for the full effect of tighter financial conditions to work through different sectors and to bring inflation down. Monetary policy will need to be restrictive for some time to have confidence that inflation is moving back to target. For these reasons, we are committed to avoiding pulling back prematurely. We also recognize that risks may become more two sided at some point. Uncertainty is currently high, and there are a range of estimates around the appropriate destination of the target range for the cycle. Proceeding deliberately and in a data- dependent manner will enable us to learn how economic activity and inflation are adjusting to the cumulative tightening and to update our assessments of the level of the policy rate that will need to be maintained for some time to bring inflation back to 2 percent.","['inflation', 'inflationary', 'monetary', 'cpi', 'spillovers']","['inflation environment', 'inflationary shocks', 'inflation rising', 'inflation monetary', 'inflation tightening']","['inflation environment monetary', 'facing high inflation', 'stability high inflation', 'high inflation environment', 'financial vulnerabilities inflation']","['inflation environment', 'additional inflationary shocks', 'monetary policy tightening', 'anchored inflation expectations', 'monetary tightening']"
7679,r220930a_FOMC,united states,2022-09-30,Large Bank Supervision and Regulation,bowman,0,"Today, I would like to talk about the future of supervision and regulation of the largest banks, which changed significantly after the financial crisis 14 years ago and has evolved more gradually over the past 5 years. As the backdrop for this look into the future, it is important to recognize that this recent past for supervision and regulation has been a success, resulting in a banking system that is safer, stronger, better capitalized, and more resilient. This is particularly true for oversight of the largest banks, including global systemically important banks (GSIBs), and their central role in the financial system. As supervision and regulation have been refined in recent years, the largest banks have maintained high levels of capital, and their resilience has been repeatedly confirmed by both supervisory and real-life stress tests. Most notably, the U.S. financial system faced the onset of the pandemic in the spring of 2020, which disrupted financial markets and raised fears of a severe crisis. During this time, banks performed very well, continuing to keep credit flowing throughout the financial system as governments and central banks responded to the crisis, setting the stage for a rapid recovery from the sharpest economic contraction that the U.S. economy has ever experienced. This outcome is a recognition, in my view, of the gradual and experiential approach to changing large bank supervision and regulation over the past several years. After the rush of regulation and the supervisory overhaul of large banks in the wake of the financial crisis, the Board of Governors took time to observe how the changes were working, and how things might be improved. Input was solicited from the public, and the changes made were incremental and carefully calibrated. I think the evidence is very clear that these changes have preserved and, in many cases, strengthened supervision and regulation, and that our gradual and evolutionary approach was wise. As I look ahead,  that record of success is a testament to the progress we have made to date and argues for the same incremental approach to ongoing refinements in supervision and regulation. I am looking forward to working with Michael Barr, the Board's Vice Chair for Supervision, on the dual goals of making the financial system safer and fairer, two objectives that I strongly support. In doing so, I am not opposed to changes that make sense, based on the experience we have gained from applying existing rules and approaches, or prompted by new and emerging issues. As always, we should ensure that any further changes yield significant improvement to safety and soundness at reasonable cost and seek to avoid approaches that fail to consider the tradeoffs between cost and safety. In forming my judgments about whether proposed changes in regulation meet the standard I have just laid out, I will be guided by the four principles I described in 2021, outlining my perspective on bank regulation and supervision. I would like to briefly discuss these four principles, and then talk about how they have guided and will guide my thinking on a number of issues important to large bank supervision and regulation. The first principle is that bank regulation and supervision should be transparent, consistent, and fair. Combined, these three elements, which we can think of collectively as due process, build respect for supervisory practices, and in doing so, make supervision more effective and encourage open communication between banks and supervisors. This principle applies equally to regulation. Supervision cannot replace--and should never supersede--rulemaking. Published regulations that have gone through the rulemaking  process, with solicitation of public comment and bona fide engagement with the issues raised, are the best and clearest way for banks to understand the rules of the road and for the bank regulatory agencies to ensure banks satisfy safety-and-soundness objectives. This brings me to the second fundamental principle for regulation and supervision: striking the right balance between ensuring safety and soundness, on the one hand, and promoting acceptable and manageable risk-taking, including encouraging responsible innovation. To put it simply, this means matching regulatory and supervisory requirements to the risks presented. For the largest banks, this naturally includes an increased focus on financial stability risks. There are obvious risks from under-regulation, and it is those risks that were addressed in the wake of the financial crisis 14 years ago. But we sometimes overlook the significant costs to our economy, and risks to safety and soundness, from over- regulation, where rules are not designed and calibrated to address the actual risks. In a time of rising interest rates that could constrain credit, it is especially important to ensure that regulation and supervision not add costs and burdens for banks with little or no benefits to safety and soundness. My third principle is that effective regulation and supervision needs to be efficient. Efficiency is key to effective regulation. In the design of a regulatory framework, there is flexibility in how to achieve a desired outcome, and there are often multiple approaches that would be effective in doing so. Once a decision has been made to regulate an activity, the next objective should be to ensure that the regulation achieves its intended purpose and that there are not more efficient alternatives that can yield those benefits at a lower cost.  My fourth and final principle is that regulation and supervision should serve a legitimate prudential purpose, like promoting safety and soundness, or reducing financial stability risk. After the last financial crisis, there was strong public support for enhancing regulation and supervision over the banking system, with a particular focus on the largest banks. And many of the steps taken after the last financial crisis have improved the resiliency of the U.S. financial system. While the need for robust regulation and supervision remains as true today as it was after the last financial crisis, regulation and supervision must also allow banks to continue providing credit and other financial products and services. Collectively, these principles guide my thinking about the future of supervision and regulation. With that framework in mind, I would like to turn to some critical issues that are relevant to large banks. As I just discussed, a critical element of due process is that rules and supervision should be consistent among firms, and over time. This can be a challenge because of the variability in the business models of banks, especially among the largest banks. Each bank is different in terms of its balance sheet, business lines, and risk profile, so regulators must be vigilant that both regulations and supervisory practices are being applied consistently. One area where this need for consistency is clear is in the Board's stress testing framework. Since 2013, stress testing has been used to assess banks' capital positions and determine whether they have sufficient capital to both absorb losses and continue lending during stressed conditions. This process has evolved considerably since its  inception, and that evolution is important to ensure that stress testing continues to be relevant and effective. Much of the stress testing framework is designed to encourage consistency--we have a common scenario design for firms, and similarly situated firms are subject to stress testing on the same frequency. However, the stress tests produce results that vary considerably from year to year due to how a specific scenario interacts with a specific firm's business model, and this volatility flows through to the stress capital buffers that apply to the largest firms. Although the stress scenarios are approved by the Board and change in some ways that are predictable over time or relate to changes in the underlying economy, how a scenario will affect a particular firm is not always predictable. These year-to-year variations are often not based in underlying changes to banks' business models and can create short-term challenges for capital management. There are likely many ways to limit this volatility while maintaining the value of the Board's stress tests, including by averaging results over multiple years. As the stress testing framework continues to evolve over time, we should take into account what we learn from past tests, feedback from the public and the banks themselves, and ensure that the test evolves in a way that improves consistency and fairness over time. Next, let's consider capital regulation. This is an area where requirements were quickly bolstered without extensive analysis in response to the 2008 financial crisis, resulting, in some cases, in redundant methods of calculating capital and demands that firms of all sizes and risk profiles comply with the highest requirements. The goal of  efficiency dictates that over time this needs to be addressed. This is indeed what has happened over the past five years. In addition, the principle of balancing safety and soundness with the need for appropriate risk-taking is reflected in the extensive tailoring framework that the Board adopted over this time period, which carefully and deliberately matched regulation and supervision to the actual risks presented by different institutions. Often, the rules adopted immediately after the financial crisis applied a one-size-fits-all approach framed around the largest banks whose activities presented the most significant risks. This approach ignores the importance of bank size and business model. Obviously, expectations for the smallest banks with simple business models should not be equivalent to the expectations for large regional banks, or for large and complex bank holding companies engaged in significant securities or cross-border activities beyond taking deposits and retail lending. As we look into the future to potential changes to the capital framework, including those expected under the Basel III endgame rulemaking, capital is a topic that is helpful to approach holistically. From my perspective, capital requirements should strike an appropriate balance for each relevant tier of firm, with requirements that appropriately address risks, including financial stability risks, while recognizing the costs of over-regulation. Calibrating capital requirements is not a zero-sum game, where more capital is necessarily always better. Regulation is not cost-free. Over-regulation can restrain bank lending, which becomes a burden for individual borrowers and a potential threat to economic growth. Thinking about capital holistically also provides an opportunity to consider adjustments to the components of the capital requirements for the largest institutions,  including the supplementary leverage ratio, the countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB), and, as I already discussed, the stress capital buffer, particularly where specific actions may have unintended consequences. Since the onset of the pandemic, the banking system has seen a significant inflow of reserves due to the Federal Reserve's asset purchases in support of the economic recovery. For some firms, the influx of reserves resulted in leverage ratios becoming binding capital constraints, rather than serving as backstops to risk-based capital requirements. While these firms' leverage ratios may become less binding as the Federal Reserve reduces the size of its balance sheet and reserves are drained from the banking system, leverage ratios that discourage banks from intermediation in the Treasury market, or from holding ultra-safe assets such as Treasuries and reserves, can distort incentives and disrupt markets. Addressing these issues could improve market functioning and financial stability. The CCyB is another component of the capital stack that deserves careful thought. In theory, the CCyB is a tool that could raise capital requirements in boom times to build resiliency and reduce capital requirements during times of stress to facilitate lending. In practice, the Board has not yet utilized the CCyB. While having releasable capital buffers shouldn't necessarily be ruled out, in my view, after a decade of stress testing and recent real-life stress experience, we have seen that the existing level of capital requirements has proven to be adequate for banks to deal with significant stress. Balancing safety and soundness with the need for appropriate risk-taking means that we should not simply assume that the further layering on of capital requirements, including through the application of the CCyB, would be beneficial.  The key is to strike an appropriate balance over time that addresses risks, including financial stability risks, without impeding the ability of the banking industry to extend credit and provide other financial services that are critical to our economy. The capital structure must also be predictable, to facilitate banks' longer-term capital planning, while preserving capital to allow firms to respond to unforeseen circumstances. I now want to turn to the review of bank mergers and acquisitions, specifically to discuss how the need for transparency, and to pursue legitimate prudential purposes, should guide our analysis of banking transactions under the established statutory framework. The regulatory consideration of mergers is guided by the statutory factors prescribed by Congress--all of which are grounded in legitimate prudential purposes. The factors considered generally include the competitive effects of the proposed merger, financial and managerial resources, future prospects of the merged institutions, convenience and needs of the communities to be served, compliance with money laundering laws, and the effect of the transaction on the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system. This analytical merger framework works best when it is accompanied by transparency, both in timelines and expectations, that allows firms to know and understand what is expected of them, and what they can fairly expect during the merger application process. The rules of the road should not change during the application process.  We should be vigilant to be sure that other factors, like the idea that mergers are harmful or that increased bank size is inherently problematic, do not infiltrate that statutory analytical framework. The analysis and approval of mergers and acquisitions should be based on the reality of how customers and the financial system would be affected. For larger banks in particular, the evolution of the merger review framework should also factor in the evolution of markets, industry, and customer preferences. A merger can have a significant impact on local communities, in terms of the quality and availability of products and services. The effects of a merger can be beneficial to communities, enhancing the safety and soundness of a firm, and leading to significant public benefits. The consequences of getting these policies wrong can significantly harm communities, in some instances creating banking ""deserts,"" especially in rural and underserved markets. Next, I would like to discuss resolution planning, or so-called living wills. large banking organization is required to periodically submit a resolution plan to the Board of Governors and the FDIC, describing the organization's plan for an orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. The requirements for these plans are established by statute and regulation, with additional guidance published to give firms appropriate notice of regulatory expectations. For the U.S.-based GSIBs, resolution plans are also informed by other regulatory requirements, including the requirement that such firms issue a minimum amount of total loss-absorbing capacity, which includes both  equity and long-term debt. The requirements that establish and support the orderly resolution of firms are important to supporting the financial stability of the United States. Of course, these requirements have evolved over time, most recently with a proposal intended to increase the efficiency of living wills by alternating between data- intensive full plans and risk-focused targeted plans. I expect that further evolution will be considered in response to ongoing changes in the financial landscape and the risks facing the largest firms. In doing so, I believe that fairness dictates that broad supervisory powers should not displace rulemaking. In my view, the need for fairness and due process in resolution planning is particularly critical when it comes to considering whether and how to address concerns about the resolvability of regional banks. This question of fairness and due process is important, and it involves, among other things, a debate about the merits of a single point of entry resolution strategy on the one hand (more common among the GSIBs), and on the other hand, established bankruptcy and FDIC bank resolution procedures. This issue transcends particular firms, and particular transactions. It is an issue that affects a broad range of institutions of similar size. And policy actions in this area will require working with colleagues at other bank regulatory agencies and seeking public comment. Fairness dictates that this debate occurs in the arena of regulation, with all the appropriate due process protections that this entails, and not on an ad hoc basis for a single firm that chooses to make an acquisition subject to regulatory approval. If the regulatory framework for resolution needs to be improved, we should look at the framework, and identify and remediate any areas of concern. It is hard to understand why banks that  choose to grow through acquisition should be subject to different resolution expectations than banks that grow organically. This strikes me as a clear example where requirements and expectations should only evolve through appropriate rulemaking processes, consistent with underlying law, in order to promote a level playing field. There are a number of other areas where I think these principles can help frame a productive conversation about the future of regulation and supervision, including around banks engaging in crypto-asset-related activities, and improving the transparency of supervisory standards. Another area where regulation and supervision continues to evolve is around banks engaging in crypto-asset activities. These activities raise a number of significant issues. When I think about the evolution of supervision and regulation of these activities, I ask myself whether the rules are clear in the current rapidly evolving environment, and whether the rules as they evolve are serving a legitimate prudential purpose. Banks seek to understand and comply with rules because, above all, they value predictability and consistency. When a bank understands the legitimacy of a rule and establishes internal incentives to comply with it, the bank itself becomes the strongest supervisory tool that there is. But sometimes, rules are difficult to apply. This can be due to quickly evolving technologies, particularly when it comes to digital assets, but it can also be due to a lack of experience with new rules, or when the rules are not that clear in a particular context. Banks should be able to know what the supervisory expectations are with respect to these new technologies in order to responsibly take advantage of them. The adoption and use of new technologies may present novel supervisory concerns, but the best way to address  these concerns and encourage innovation is dialogue between bankers and supervisors before and during the development and implementation of those technologies. I believe the goal with digital assets should be to match oversight to risk, and to provide clarity in supervisory expectations for banks seeking to engage in the crypto- asset ecosystem. As fluctuations in crypto-asset prices have shown, there clearly are material risks associated with these assets. However, it is also an area where there has been and continues to be intense consumer demand, and we should consider whether there is a stabilizing role for banks to play in intermediation, or ensure that the competitive landscape does not create a financial stability risk by pushing activities outside the banking system, as we have seen with the mortgage industry. To be effective in this space, any clarity regulators provide will need to recognize that this is not a risk- free activity, but I believe we should allow banks to participate as long as the risks can be identified and managed appropriately and responsibly. Another way to promote consistency is to continue improving the disclosures around supervisory standards. While doing so improves transparency, it also improves fairness, another of my core principles. Like the due process protections enshrined in the U.S. Constitution and embedded in regulatory law, fairness is fundamental to the legitimacy and effectiveness of financial oversight, including supervision. In the context of bank regulation and supervision, fairness means being transparent about expectations, which should be clearly laid out in advance (and I want to emphasize that ""in advance"" part). Supervision should not be adjusted in specific situations to displace or alter regulations, or without appropriate notice and opportunity for public comment, and should be accompanied by clear communication with regulated firms. Where we have  established precedents, we should respect them. Banks rely on our precedents in making their business decisions, so not respecting precedents can interfere with the ability of firms to plan and to fairly compete. If changes to precedents are appropriate, we should explain those intentions and employ a transparent and accountable administrative process to ensure fairness and appropriately implement the change. Take, for example, the supervision criteria implemented by the Large Institution not public. Making these materials public would not only improve transparency, doing so would also provide some assurance to the banks subject to them that they are being held to the same supervisory expectations as their peers over time. Without this clarity, it is far more challenging to build trust in this aspect of the supervisory process. Improving transparency around supervisory standards promotes safety and soundness, both encouraging compliance, and limiting the role of formal and informal enforcement actions and penalties in addressing serious issues. In my view, success should not be measured by penalties or enforcement, but by how well banks are following the rules. The principles I've articulated today reflect my approach to considering whether and how the regulation and supervision of the largest banks should evolve in response to changing economic and financial conditions. The regulation and supervision of financial institutions must be nimble to address new risks to safety and soundness and financial stability, but should always consider tradeoffs and potential unintended consequences, like increasing the cost of lending or pushing financial activities outside of the regulatory perimeter into the shadow banking system. I look forward to working with Vice Chair  Barr, my fellow Board members, and colleagues at the other bank regulatory agencies, as we consider the evolution of supervision and regulation for the largest financial institutions.","['banking', 'banks', 'bankers', 'bank', 'regulation']","['bank supervision', 'supervision banking', 'crisis regulation', 'bank regulatory', 'stability banking']","['large bank supervision', 'regulation supervision banking', 'bank regulation supervision', 'supervision largest banks', 'bank supervision regulation']","['large bank supervision', 'bank regulation', 'large banking organization', 'important banks', 'banking']"
3241,r220930a_ECB,euro area,2022-09-30,Monetary policy in a cost-of-living crisis,schnabel,0,"The euro area is facing a cost-of-living crisis. An increasing proportion of people's income is being spent on essential purchases, such as food and energy. At the same time, price pressures are broadening and nominal wages are not keeping pace with rising prices. The result is a marked loss in people's purchasing power and a decline in the labour share of income, which is the share of total income paid to workers as wages, salaries and other benefits. Today I want to make four conceptual points about these developments. First, I will argue that the secular decline in the bargaining power of workers can help explain the decline in the labour share of income, which can be expected to weigh on private consumption and thus dampen aggregate demand. Second, I will ask what factors determine the future evolution of real wages and hence how the costs of this crisis are distributed between workers and firms in the future. I will argue that the risks of a wage-price spiral are contained, provided inflation expectations remain anchored. Third, I will discuss why a decline in real wages and a slowdown in aggregate demand may not materially ease current inflationary pressures. One reason is that today's energy crisis will suppress both supply and demand. A second reason is that firms will try to protect their profit margins from higher energy costs. My final point relates to the implications for monetary policy. If there is a tangible risk that lower demand will not ease inflationary pressures, there is a strong case for a ""robust control"" approach to monetary policy, guided by the principle of a forward-looking central bank that takes its decisions with a view to stabilising medium-term inflation. The outlook for wages plays an important role in assessing the risks of current high inflation becoming entrenched over time. Two channels are most relevant for monetary policy. The first is the . Real wages determine households' purchasing power, and hence affect the outlook for private consumption and prices. The pandemic is a case in point. The fast rebound in real wages following the lockdowns in 2020 has been a key driver boosting demand. ECB staff analysis suggests that resilient demand has significantly contributed to the recent rise in underlying inflation in the euro area (Slide 2). The second channel relevant for monetary policy is the . Wages are an important element in firms' cost structure. In the services industry, for example, wages account for around 40% of firms' total cost of production. Thus, changes in wage dynamics are typically significant enough to affect firms' future pricing decisions. An example of this cost-push view of inflation is the increase in the minimum wage in Germany, which takes effect tomorrow. According to a survey, around 60% of affected firms said that they intend to raise prices in response to the increase in the minimum wage. Central banks have different ways to analyse and evaluate the relevance and strength of these two channels for the inflation outlook. Despite its pitfalls, a prime tool for making such an assessment is the New Keynesian Phillips curve. Under this framework, firms set prices as a mark-up over marginal costs. Because firms are forward-looking and change prices only infrequently, profit maximisation implies that consumer price inflation fundamentally depends on current and future expected real marginal costs. Real marginal costs, in turn, can empirically be related to average cost measures, such as real unit labour costs, which are defined as the ratio of real wages to labour productivity. Using real unit labour costs as an indicator yields two important insights. One is that rising real wages resulting from stronger productivity growth will leave unit labour costs unchanged and will not put pressure on firms' profits. It should, therefore, not lead to firms raising prices. The cost-push channel thus critically depends on future productivity developments. The second insight is that, from an accounting perspective, real unit labour costs are identical to the labour share of income. That is, for the aggregate demand channel to be consistent with higher inflation, the labour share of income should go up. The link between the labour share and inflation is not just a conceptual idea. New research by economists at the Federal Reserve Board suggests that the sharp decline in inflation in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1980s may have been driven to a significant extent by the marked decline in the labour share. The study suggests that the secular erosion of workers' bargaining power is an important factor explaining the joint dynamics of inflation and the labour share. The same mechanism has likely been at work in the euro area. From the early 1980s until the eve of the global financial crisis, the labour share of income fell significantly and persistently, coinciding with a measurable decline in inflation and trade union density (Slide 3, left-hand chart). The flip side of the decline in the labour share was the marked rise in the profit share (Slide 3, right-hand chart). The loss in workers' bargaining power might also explain what we are seeing today. Despite a historically tight labour market, a substantial decline in real consumer wages is weighing on the labour share of income. Although nominal wage growth is gradually picking up, the current pace of increase has been insufficient to preserve people's purchasing power. Compared to the third quarter of last year, real wages declined by nearly 5% (Slide 4, left-hand chart). These developments are fundamentally different from the experience of the 1970s when real wages and the labour share of income increased measurably in response to rising energy prices. Low-income households are those most severely affected. For a given nominal wage, their loss in purchasing power has been larger than that of others as the gap in the inflation rate faced by the lowest and highest income quintiles has been rising sharply over the course of this year, reflecting differences in the weight of energy and food in people's expenditures (Slide 4, right-hand chart). Current real wage developments thus point towards a notable slowdown in private consumption, consistent with the sharp drop in consumer confidence, which fell to a new historical low in September (Slide 5, left-hand chart). The aggregate demand channel therefore points to an easing in inflationary pressures. The cost-push channel, too, currently suggests that wages are unlikely to add to inflation going forward, as real producer wages, deflated using sectoral value added deflators, have also fallen across most industries since the start of the pandemic (Slide 5, right-hand chart). In fact, profits across a broad range of industries have risen markedly, even in some contact-intensive sectors (Slide 6, left-hand chart). This means that many firms have so far been able to increase their prices beyond the increase in nominal wages, and in many cases even beyond the increase in energy costs. In the hospitality and transport sectors, for example, profits have expanded by nearly 20% since the outbreak of the pandemic, more than twice as fast as the growth rate of nominal wages. The rise in profits is strikingly different from previous crises that have all seen profits fall. This suggests that strong pent-up demand created an environment for many firms to boost profit margins. These developments pose two relevant questions for monetary policy. The first question relates to the outlook for real wages. The disruptive change to our economies may challenge the way the economic burden from the energy shock, and the resulting deterioration in the euro area's terms of trade, will be distributed between firms and workers in the future. This question goes well beyond the realm of central banks. If real wages continued to decline at the current pace, the drastic loss in purchasing power would cause economic hardship and despair. If, however, workers were to increasingly resist real wage cuts, inflation could become endemic. Both courses of events could lead to a concerning increase in inequality and risk eroding support of our democratic institutions. How real wages will evolve depends on three factors. The first is fiscal policy. Targeted fiscal transfers can limit the loss in purchasing power of those suffering the most from the current crisis. Such transfers would also cushion the hit to aggregate demand, as they would operate where the marginal propensity to consume out of additional income is highest. The broader the measures are, however, and the more they stimulate demand, the more likely it is that inflation will persist for longer. This would raise the risk of a wage-price spiral, making a more forceful response of monetary policy necessary. The second factor relates to a shift in the bargaining power of unions and workers. Record-high inflation and acute labour shortages seem to have strengthened workers' resolve to protect their purchasing power. In the first half of this year, growth in nominal compensation per employee has accelerated to levels not seen since the introduction of the euro (Slide 6, right-hand chart). Empirical evidence shows that, for a sample of advanced economies, the impact of past and future expected inflation on wage demands is rising. Institutional changes may reinforce a period of stronger nominal wage growth ahead. Here in Spain, for example, a growing share of wage contracts is indexed to inflation. At the same time, re-shoring efforts by firms in some sectors may exacerbate bottlenecks in labour markets and further strengthen the bargaining power of unions. The third factor relates to monetary policy. Whether future wage agreements will lead to a more balanced distribution of the costs associated with the energy shock, or whether they will lead to a perilous wage-price spiral, will ultimately depend on the credibility of the euro area's nominal anchor. If long-term inflation expectations remain anchored, the risks of a wage-price spiral will be limited. This is what we have observed so far in the euro area. The ECB's forward-looking wage tracker currently points to further increases in wages, but these are expected to remain at levels that are unlikely to set in motion a harmful wage-price dynamic. Therefore, while a close monitoring of wage developments remains essential, at present the most likely outcome remains a further decline in real consumer wages and the labour share of income. Our consumer expectations survey points in a similar direction. It found that households anticipate their real wages to fall by around 6% over the next twelve months (Slide 7, left-hand chart). This brings me to the second question for monetary policy, namely to what extent a decline in real wages and the labour share will ease current strong inflationary pressures through its effect on aggregate demand. Such an endogenous effect on prices would support the efforts of monetary policy to bring inflation back to levels consistent with price stability. There are, however, two reasons to believe that the relationship between the labour share and inflation might currently be blurred - either because the labour share may no longer be a sufficient summary indicator, or because the slope of the New Keynesian Phillips curve has become flat or statistically insignificant. As a result, underlying inflation may remain high despite weakening demand. The first reason relates to the implications of changes in the labour share for changes in capacity utilisation. Whether, and by how much, a decline in aggregate demand will create conditions of excess capacity critically depends on the impact of current shocks on the supply side. If, as is likely, both supply and demand weaken, the net impact on economic slack, and hence prices, will be more difficult to anticipate. The damage from the current crisis to the supply side is likely to be significant. Energy-related production cuts and energy-saving measures directly curb potential output, while the sharp increase in gas prices will render some energy-intensive activities unprofitable. Insolvencies may rise, and parts of the capital stock may become obsolete. Moreover, productivity growth may be slower than currently anticipated in our staff projections. Lower productivity growth would directly dampen the decline in real unit labour costs from lower real wages, meaning that inflationary pressures could remain elevated at current rates of nominal wage growth. The September ECB staff projections have already seen a marked downward revision of labour productivity growth for 2023, mainly on account of lower expected growth. Yet, two distinct features of the current cycle suggest that productivity growth may become structurally weaker. One is the acute worker shortage, which may force firms to hoard labour during the downturn. The decline in real wages reinforces this channel by making hoarding more attractive. The second feature is that the pandemic has failed to kickstart a process of Schumpeterian ""creative destruction"". Contrary to previous recessions, business insolvencies fell sharply, mainly reflecting the widespread use of job retention schemes. A decline in productivity may be one side effect of these otherwise highly successful programmes. So, if the damage, or the constraints, to the supply side are significant, then the impact of a slowdown in demand on capacity utilisation may be smaller, limiting downward pressure on prices. For that reason, whether demand is below or above its pre-pandemic level is largely irrelevant for the future path of inflation. Looking at firms' current order books supports this view. Despite a notable slowdown in new orders over the past few months, euro area firms are only slowly reducing the pandemic-induced backlog of orders. This suggests that significant supply-side constraints remain even if delivery times have eased recently (Slide 7, right-hand chart). The second factor driving a wedge between inflation and the labour share relates to the role of profits. Unit labour costs account for a significant share of firms' total costs and are hence central to the cost-push view of inflation. But the increase in other costs, such as the cost of capital or energy, is currently working in the opposite direction. Specifically, the unprecedented scale of pipeline pressures means that firms may choose not to pass lower real unit labour costs on to consumer prices to protect their profit margins from higher energy costs. In some sectors, where producers have not been able to increase prices above the rise in costs, there could even be pressure on firms to actually raise prices, in line with the cost-push view of inflation. This is consistent with recent survey evidence. With pipeline pressures remaining significant, a still historically large share of firms in the manufacturing, retail and services sectors plan to raise prices further over the coming months (Slide 8, left-hand chart). Of course, such surveys say nothing about the size of future price increases, meaning inflation could still slow. However, the surveys do not signal a fast unwinding of price pressures on the back of the expected decline in aggregate demand. The implication for monetary policy is unambiguous: it would be imprudent for a stability-oriented central bank to chart the future course of interest rates on the assumption that a slowdown in demand will reduce the need for adjusting the monetary policy stance. Today's energy shock affects potential output directly through its impact on productivity and the capital stock. Together with historically tight labour markets, this makes it unlikely that the euro area economy will operate under much economic slack over the medium term. On the contrary, if the hit to the supply side is significant, there is even a risk that the output gap turns positive earlier than expected despite weakening demand. Recent inflation dynamics underscore these risks. Although surveys have been pointing to a sharp slowdown in demand for several months now, underlying inflation continues to rise in the euro area. Trimmed mean inflation, which is a good indicator of underlying inflation at a time of persistent energy and food shocks, increased to 6.9% in August, similar in scale to the situation in the United States (Slide 8, right-hand chart). Uncertainty about the persistence of inflation therefore continues to call for a ""robust control"" approach to monetary policy, which reduces the risks that medium and long-term inflation expectations move further away from our 2% target. The pivotal role of inflation expectations in driving a potential wage-price spiral reinforces this approach. My remarks today demonstrate that such a ""robust control"" approach is firmly guided by the medium-term inflation outlook. Although the outbreak of the pandemic, and the war in Ukraine, have measurably reduced the ability of central banks and other professional forecasters to correctly anticipate the broad future path of inflation, long and variable lags in the transmission of monetary policy still require policy to be calibrated on what central banks think is the most likely future course of the economy, also taking into account the impact of their own actions on aggregate demand and price formation. However, in an environment of disruptive change, central banks cannot narrowly rely on model-based forecasts. Structural change often has large effects on the stability of model parameters and on the appropriate assumptions underlying these models. Such uncertainty puts a premium on incoming data. In particular, actual inflation outcomes, price-setting intentions and data on the current state of the economy can provide important insights for policymakers about the likely persistence of inflation, and what this may imply for the appropriate policy stance. Equally important are indicators summarising the impact of interest rate changes on the price and availability of credit to firms and households. Such indicators are useful complements to highly uncertain estimates of the equilibrium rate of interest to inform our thinking about when, and to what extent, monetary policy is becoming restrictive for growth. For example, the latest European Commission survey shows that the share of firms reporting financial constraints as limiting production remains near historically low levels. Bank lending to firms even expanded notably in July and August from already elevated levels, and firms continue to add new jobs, suggesting that monetary policy continues to stimulate growth and employment. Considering these data and the above-target medium-term inflation outlook, further increases in our key policy rates will be needed to ensure that inflation returns to our 2% target in a timely manner.

7681,r221004a_FOMC,united states,2022-10-04,Technology’s Impact on the Post-Pandemic Economy,jefferson,0,"Good morning, and thank you. It is a pleasure to be here today. I am happy to be giving my first speech as a member of the Board of Governors at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. I would like to thank the Atlanta, Dallas, and Richmond Feds for inviting me today and for bringing together this collection of expertise and research. Today I would like to continue the discussion you have been having about tech- enabled responses to the pandemic. Then I would like to delve a bit further into what those pandemic-related disruptions have meant for economic activity at the microlevel and how the changes of the past few years affect how I view the outlook for the macroeconomy. This may be my first speech as a Fed Governor, but I am well aware of one practice associated with these occasions. That practice requires me to say that I am speaking for myself alone. My views do not necessarily reflect those of anyone else at the Board of Governors or in the Federal Reserve System. Turning to the subject of this conference, there is no question that technology helped households and businesses to adapt and adjust in many ways to the disruption brought about by the pandemic. Those adaptations--from enabling people to keep working to helping businesses stay open--undoubtedly prevented worse outcomes. They also likely changed the economic landscape for good and, in many cases, for the better-- from hybrid working and how businesses approach distribution, investment, and inventories to the way consumers shop and pay for goods and services. Those changes are evident across broad categories, each of which this conference has discussed in some detail.  Supply chain and business investment underwent, and are still experiencing, significant change. Large increases in computers and peripherals investment enabled remote work and helped to automate processes at physical establishments while simultaneously minimizing in-person contact. Likewise, the labor market showed great adaptability in the rapidity and relative ease that many sectors showed in shifting to remote working. Of course, that did not translate to all areas of employment, such as those jobs that require person-to-person interaction. Nevertheless, technology allowed many employees to continue working during a pandemic. Also, it likely had an indelible effect on current and future ways of working, including encapsulating hybrid work and greater flexibility for employees as fixtures. The shift to remote and hybrid learning, however, was difficult, but without technology, learning during lockdown might have ceased entirely. In some cases, schools were closed for only a few weeks or months, and the entire in-person learning apparatus was replaced with technology-enabled remote learning. The teachers and administrators--and I was one at the time--adapted remarkably quickly to a dramatically different set of tools and techniques. Teachers, students, and parents made a rapid shift to an entirely new dynamic, often on entirely new platforms. We are still learning the lessons of that interlude, and they can influence how schools at all levels think about future planning. My colleagues and I recently heard from a community college administrator about the challenges she faced. Training programs that fill worker demand in local industries require hands-on experience, which meant retooling the curriculum for a hybrid environment. Student services also had to change to accommodate the increased  need for childcare and other pandemic-related hurdles, or her school risked a drop in enrollment. The payments system has also seen an acceleration in alternative online and mobile payment methods as well as contactless payment options. We all remember the onset of the pandemic, when social distancing became imperative and delivery and curbside pickup became the norm for many. Remote card payments naturally rose as in- person use fell. As stores reopened while the fear factor was still considerable, the contactless payment options that were available on cards and mobile devices received more attention. Such changes, coupled with the growing prominence of person-to-person money transfer apps, provided consumers with remote and touchless cash substitutes in their daily lives. The expanded use of those various payment options rested on the foundation of an intricate, robust payments ecosystem. That system supported a migration from in-person payment options to no-contact alternatives, helping restart the economy during a time of deep stress. These are just a few of the examples you have been discussing, and there are many more. The pandemic, and the tech-enabled responses to it, changed the economy in fundamental ways that will likely not revert. It is vital to understand those changes and the effects they will have going forward. As an economist looking at these issues on a microlevel, I appreciate the expertise on display at this conference. From my new perch as a Fed Governor taking the macro view, the research presented gives more context to the wider economic playing field. From either perspective, the technology-enabled responses and the changes brought about  by the pandemic itself are important issues for policymakers to understand. They affect how we look at the economy overall. As I look ahead, I am considering how those changes affect the outlook, and I would like to speak a bit about how I see the economy evolving as we move forward. The labor market remains strong, as can be seen across a variety of measures, from the low unemployment rate to the high quits rate, which illustrates the confidence of workers who are willing to leave their jobs in pursuit of better ones. Labor force participation remains lower than it was prior to the pandemic, reflecting several factors, including people who left the workforce for early retirement and some remaining parents and other caregivers who stayed home through the pandemic. These are not factors that reverse on a dime. With still-strong labor demand and sluggish labor supply, the job market remains very tight. Workers are moving between jobs more rapidly than in the past, putting upward pressure on wages. In a market with more job openings than workers, the competition to fill vacancies is leading to rapid wage gains now, and the resulting salary compression may lead to further upward wage pressures in the future. As growth has slowed this year, supply-demand conditions in the labor market--and the overall economy--seem likely to ease some. We have already seen some indications from survey data, information from transportation hubs, and producer prices that supply bottlenecks have, at long last, begun to resolve. Nonetheless, inflation remains elevated, and this is the problem that concerns me most. Inflation creates economic burdens for households and businesses, and everyone  feels its effects. It can also change people's expectations about how long lasting price rises will be. Those inflation expectations can become entrenched and, in doing so, increase the likelihood that high inflation will persist. While oil and gasoline prices have come down in recent months, I am concerned that fluctuations in prices of the goods to which people pay the most attention, like food and housing, will affect expectations of future inflation. Thankfully, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored, consistent with our 2 percent target. I will be watching those expectations closely. An important outcome of the shifts you have been discussing, from firms' production patterns and distribution mechanisms to consumers' purchasing decisions, is that inflation dynamics likely changed also. How and why prices change require careful study and analysis, and a data-driven approach is more essential than ever. Restoring price stability may take some time and will likely entail a period of below-trend growth. However, I want to assure you that my colleagues and I are resolute that we will bring inflation back down to 2 percent. The full effects of monetary policy take time, but in my brief time on the Federal Open Market Committee, we have acted boldly to address rising inflation, and we are committed to taking the further steps necessary. The fundamental shifts at the core of the economy shape my approach to policy. As we are assessing the dynamics of the macroeconomy amid rapid changes, we will be watching the data closely and applying rigorous analysis. My focus is on progress toward our goal.  It is too soon to say whether the pandemic and the changes it brought--many of which this conference has covered--are going to be permanent or ebb as time goes by. My guess is that it is likely to be a combination of the two, with some features becoming embedded, such as new approaches to working and contactless payments, and others returning to something like they were before, like the preference for in-person education. Either way, it will take time for these changes to prove themselves to be either permanent fixtures or temporary features. Research will play a key role as we try to answer important questions. New data will help us analyze the changes to the economy, and research will assemble the pieces of the puzzle that show the bigger picture. As we watch and assess developments in the U.S. economy, we will have to take into consideration a multitude of factors, including those rooted in technology-enabled disruption, and the strength and the staying power of the many forces that are shaping the economy. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to your questions.","['policymakers', 'pandemic', 'governors', 'governor', 'disruptions']","['discussing pandemic', 'pandemic changes', 'working pandemic', 'pandemic important', 'governor aware']","['discussing pandemic tech', 'fed governor aware', 'speech fed governor', 'pandemic important issues', 'disruption brought pandemic']","['fed governor', 'policymakers', 'pandemic', 'governors', 'disruptions']"
7683,r221006a_FOMC,united states,2022-10-06,The Economic Outlook with a Look at the Housing Market,waller,0,"Thank you, Jim, and thank you to the University of Kentucky for the opportunity to speak to you today. It is nice to be back in the Bluegrass state and see old friends and colleagues. I taught at UK from 1998 to 2003 and one of my colleagues at that time was Mark Berger, who passed away at far too young an age. Mark was a good friend, and I am honored to speak in this seminar series that is named after him. My subject is the outlook for the U.S. economy and inflation, and the Federal Reserve's efforts to get inflation under control. I will start with the outlook for the economy, focusing on inflation, and then turn to a discussion of the housing market, where strong demand has outrun limited supply, causing substantial increases in prices for shelter, which is a large component of inflation. Because the housing market is sensitive to changes in interest rates and thus to monetary policy, I'll conclude by discussing how housing is being affected by the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) efforts to achieve our dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices. Recent data on economic activity suggest that after a slight contraction in gross domestic product in the first half of this year, the economy is posed for modest but below-trend growth in the latter half. Meanwhile, the labor market remains strong and very tight. Employers added 315,000 jobs in August, well above the rate needed to keep up with population growth. While the unemployment rate rose, that was largely due to nearly 800,000 people who joined the civilian labor force, many of them drawn in by ample job openings and fast wage growth. At 3.7 percent, the unemployment rate was below the median projection for its long run rate among FOMC participants. Furthermore, initial unemployment claims are very low and stable. We will get another  jobs report tomorrow. Expectations are for job gains of around 260,000, which would be lower than recent months but very healthy relative to past experience. A jobs number in this range along with the job openings rate reported on Tuesday would show that the labor market is slowing a bit but is still quite tight. As a result, I don't expect tomorrow's jobs report to alter my view that we should be focused 100 percent on reducing inflation. Since I last spoke about the economic outlook on September 9, we have received two important pieces of data on inflation for August, consumer price index (CPI) and the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE). Both reports confirmed that overall inflation remained much too high in August. Though gasoline prices fell, which was very welcome news for consumers, food prices increased notably. Core PCE inflation, which strips out the volatile categories of food and energy, moved up to 0.6 percent for the month, which implies an annualized rate of inflation of about 7 percent in core goods and services. Furthermore, core PCE inflation is not only high, but very persistent, with monthly prints of core PCE inflation at an annualized rate averaging about 5 percent this year. These numbers indicate that inflation is far from the FOMC's goal and not likely to fall quickly. This is not the inflation outcome I am looking for to support a slower pace of rate hikes or a lower terminal policy rate than projected in the September 2022 SEP. And, though there are additional data to come, in my view, we haven't yet made meaningful progress on inflation and until that progress is both meaningful and persistent, I support continued rate increases, along with ongoing reductions in the Fed's balance sheet, to  help restrain aggregate demand. As far as achieving our dual mandate, this is a one-sided battle. We currently do not face a tradeoff between our employment objective and our inflation objective, so monetary policy can and must be used aggressively to bring down inflation. Let me turn to the troubling persistence of inflation. In the past couple of inflation reports, housing services has been a major contributor to measured inflation. In the latest inflation reports, shelter prices rose 0.7 percent on a monthly basis. Housing has a large weight in price indexes, as households spend a sizable amount of their incomes on housing services. The combination of high monthly inflation and a large weight in measuring overall prices means that shelter inflation is a key driver of overall inflation. Moreover, shelter inflation is a particularly persistent component of inflation and why I am focused on closely watching shelter inflation in determining my outlook for U.S. inflation. Unfortunately, the message is that shelter inflation will likely remain high for several months, meaning overall core PCE inflation will continue to be persistently high. There has been a considerable imbalance in the supply and demand for housing for some time. Housing is also sensitive to interest rates and thus quite responsive to monetary policy. So for the next few minutes, I would like to focus on how demand- supply imbalance in both owner-occupied and rental markets came about, how it is affecting prices for housing today and in future, and how housing is likely to affect the FOMC's efforts to return inflation to our 2 percent goal. Housing demand increased strongly in the years leading up to the pandemic, sustained by relatively low interest rates, the formation of new households, and rising  incomes. Demand for housing then surged during the pandemic as people spent more time at home, initially on the intensive margin--more housing square footage per household. Couples in apartments wanted more space to work from home and opted for bigger apartments or houses. Also, remote work enabled people to work from preferable locations so the demand for second homes surged. As the pandemic wore on, demand for housing also increased on the extensive margin--meaning more household formation--as roommates sharing apartments now wanted to live on their own as they continued to work from home. And adult children began moving out of their parent's homes. All of these factors led to higher rates of household formation and greater demand for housing. So, by the end of 2021, the pandemic was driving up the demand for housing on both margins. Meanwhile, the pandemic's supply constraints caused shortages in construction materials and construction workers, limiting the supply of new housing. The combination of soaring demand for housing and limited supply until earlier this year meant the housing market had substantial excess demand, which was reflected in substantial increases in housing costs. But now imbalances in the owner-occupied market have started to shift. Due to the Fed's actual and anticipated tightening of monetary policy, mortgage rates have increased from less than 3 percent at the end of last year to nearly 7 percent recently. Higher borrowing costs have made it more expensive for households to buy homes, whether they are first-time buyers or trading their current home for a different one. And so, we have seen big drops in home sales over the course of this year. The monthly numbers of new and existing home sales are now back below the average levels seen in  the few years before the pandemic. And the August decline in pending home sales released last week suggests that sales will fall further. Reflecting the slowdown in sales, builders have responded by pulling back on starting new single-family homes. So far, the contraction in housing demand has been more pronounced than the changes in supply, and so inventories of homes for sale have increased. While inventories of existing homes are still low in historical terms, they have grown a lot for new homes. Based on the current pace of sales, estimates of the number of months of supply of new homes has shot up and is now nearing the peaks seen in 2008 during the previous housing cycle. The easing in housing demand can also be seen in a slowdown in house price increases. Nationwide, prices of existing homes rose by about 20 percent over the 12 months ending in May, while they rose at an annual rate of less than 10 percent in recent months. Prices have even fallen in some areas of the country, especially those that saw the largest increases over the previous two years. And many builders are reportedly cutting their list prices and offering larger incentives. The combination of price cuts and slowing of new single-family construction should help builders work off excess inventory, continuing to bring the market into better balance. In addition, after mortgage rates stabilize, their drag on housing demand should ebb. While this market correction could be fairly mild, I cannot dismiss the possibility of a much larger drop in demand and house prices before the market normalizes. Despite the risk of a material correction in house prices, several factors help reduce my concern that such a correction would trigger a wave of mortgage defaults and potentially destabilize the financial system. One is that because of relatively tight  mortgage underwriting in the 2010s, the credit scores of mortgage borrowers today are generally higher than they were prior to that last housing correction. Also, the experience of the last correction taught us that most borrowers only default when they experience a negative shock to their incomes in addition to being underwater on their mortgage. Because people still need a place to live, demand for rental housing has remained quite strong. Rental vacancy rates are very low. Reflecting this fact, multifamily construction has been quite high this year, at a level not seen since the mid-1980s, when the tax treatment of investment in structures was much more favorable than it is today. But demand is still much greater than supply, so rents have continued to surge. So what does all of this mean for inflation? The measures of inflation that receive the most attention in the United States attempt to measure the prices of goods and services consumed by households. For housing, this means measuring the price of consuming the shelter and other services provided by a home. The price of shelter is most easily measured by rents. Of course, rent cannot be observed for owner-occupied homes. For these homes, the price of shelter is estimated as the rent that owners would pay based on rents of nearby rental units. The purchase price of a home is not incorporated into these measures of inflation because it reflects the cost to invest in a real estate asset, not the price to consume the shelter that housing provides. As I mentioned earlier, rent growth has been very high recently. The housing services component of the PCE price index rose a bit above 0.7 percent in August, which was slightly above the previous three-month average. And I expect a similar pace to continue for a while, well into next year. Why? Shelter inflation measures the rents actually paid by households. Only a fraction of households sign a new lease in a given  month or renew their lease each month. So, when monthly shelter inflation is calculated, it includes a large share of homes under lease where rents did not change. As a result, changes in market conditions show up in the inflation statistics only over a period of several months. In addition, the inflation statistics use a six-month average when calculating rent growth. Asking rents and rents on new lease contracts--which do reflect contemporaneous rental market conditions--have been rising at a fast pace for more than a year. These increases have fueled shelter inflation so far this year, and they should continue to do so for at least the next six months. That said, there is a glimmer of hope in the most recent readings of asking rents, where the rate of increase has stepped down a bit. This slower pace should eventually contribute to a slowdown in shelter inflation, although that might not be seen until later next year. So now let's consider the implications of this picture of the current and future housing market for overall inflation and monetary policy. If we assume that the recent rate of inflation in the cost of shelter continues, how much would prices of goods and other services need to moderate in order to lower overall inflation meaningfully--say, to When talking about future inflation, it is most helpful to focus on measures of core inflation. So if the price index for housing services continues to increase at the recent monthly average rate of around 0.6 percent for the next several months, then other core price increases would need to moderate considerably, to a monthly average of a bit less than 0.2 percent. This would be a big slowdown from inflation in August, which  had core inflation of 0.6 percent, with non-housing services and core goods each increasing more than 0.5 percent. Such a step-down in non-housing core inflation, if sustained over several months, would be a big improvement in inflation, and I think it is quite possible to get there because of the considerable tightening of monetary policy that has occurred so far and additional anticipated tightening. But this exercise shows why it is so important for the FOMC to maintain its focus on the appropriate path of monetary policy in order to moderate demand. While housing seems likely to continue contributing to high inflation in the near term, in the medium-term higher mortgage rates should slow the housing component of inflation as housing demand cools. Meanwhile, increases in broader interest rates should help moderate demand and damp inflation in other sectors. So, across sectors, a moderation in demand should help bring inflation down toward our 2 percent target. As we think about policy actions for the remainder of the year, one can look at the Summary of Economic Projections released by the FOMC at our meeting last month. These projections showed participants expected an additional 100 to 125 basis points of tightening by the end of the year, which means either a couple of 50 basis point hikes at our remaining two meetings, or 75 basis points in November and 50 basis points in December. Of course, the exact path for policy will depend on the data we receive between now and the end of the year. Before the next meeting on November 1-2, there is not going to be a lot of new data to cause a big adjustment to how I see inflation, employment, and the rest of the economy holding up. We will get September payroll employment data tomorrow, and  CPI and PCE inflation reports later this month. I don't think that this extent of data is likely to be sufficient to significantly alter my view of the economy, and I expect most policymakers will feel the same way. I imagine we will have a very thoughtful discussion about the pace of tightening at our next meeting. So, as of today, I believe the stance of monetary policy is slightly restrictive, and we are starting to see some adjustment to excess demand in interest-sensitive sectors like housing. But more needs to be done to bring inflation down meaningfully and persistently. I anticipate additional rate hikes into early next year, and I will be watching the data carefully to decide the appropriate pace of tightening as we continue to move into more restrictive territory. In considering what might happen to alter my expectations about the path of policy, I've read some speculation recently that financial stability concerns could possibly lead the FOMC to slow rate increases or halt them earlier than expected. Let me be clear that this is not something I'm considering or believe to be a very likely development. I am a little confused about this speculation. While there has been some increased volatility and liquidity strains in financial markets lately, overall, I believe markets are operating effectively. Actions by banks and financial regulators in recent years have greatly strengthened the financial system. Banks are well capitalized. Functioning in the Treasury, equity, and commodity markets remains orderly. One factor that is likely helping to stabilize the financial system is the existence of monetary policy tools which could serve as a backup source of liquidity in times of financial stress. For example, swap lines that the Fed maintains with other central banks  have been used effectively in the past to relieve stress in the financial system, and I think the availability of these facilities tend to be a stabilizing force at other times. In addition, to help implement monetary policy, the Fed established new standing repurchase agreement (repo) facilities in July 2021, one for domestic counterparties and another for foreign and international monetary authorities. These facilities are capable of responding to strains that may put upward pressure on money market rates, but I think it is likely that their mere existence has been a stabilizing force. Along with the improved regulatory framework, I believe we have tools in place to address any financial stability concerns and should not be looking to monetary policy for this purpose. The focus of monetary policy needs to be fighting inflation.","['inflation', 'housing', 'economy', 'cpi', 'households']","['inflation housing', 'easing housing', 'economy inflation', 'housing demand', 'shelter inflation']","['inflation housing market', 'inflation housing demand', 'housing core inflation', 'housing component inflation', 'inflation reports housing']","['future housing market', 'housing demand', 'shelter inflation', 'latest inflation reports', 'housing market']"
7682,r221006b_FOMC,united states,2022-10-06,Economic Outlook,cook,0,"Thank you, Adam, and thank you to the Peterson Institute for inviting me to speak today. This is my first speech as a Fed Governor, and I am delighted to deliver it here, joining friends and colleagues from across my career, from academia to policymaking. I would like to start with a discussion of the U.S. economy, including the implications of international developments, and then talk about my approach as a policymaker and how I view the current stance of monetary policy. I will begin with the labor market, which is very strong. Employment rebounded much more swiftly post-pandemic than it did during previous recoveries and has continued to grow at a rapid pace of about 440,000 jobs a month so far this year. The unemployment rate, at 3.7 percent, remains very low. Other indicators also point to labor market strength: Despite a large drop in the number of job openings in August, which may suggest that labor demand is moderating, there is still an unusually high 1.7 job openings per unemployed job seeker. Meanwhile, layoffs are near historical lows, and the quits rate is well above pre-pandemic levels even as it has moderated somewhat, indicating that workers still feel confident they can find another job. On the supply side, labor force participation has recovered more slowly than expected and has largely moved sideways this year even after a welcome rise to 62.4 percent in August. Early retirements prompted by the pandemic have not yet reversed. Some of these are likely due to fear of exposure to COVID-19. And COVID continues to weigh on a full recovery in labor supply in other ways as well, as people with long-haul cases and caring responsibilities stay home and others lose hours to short-  term illness. If the health impact of COVID-19 continues to diminish, I am optimistic that more workers will reenter the labor force, but there is a risk that labor supply remains below its pre-pandemic trend. On the price stability side of the Fed's mandate, inflation remains stubbornly and unacceptably high, and data over the past few months show that inflationary pressures remain broad based. My focus, therefore, is on bringing inflation back down to our 2 percent target. I am heartened to see measures of medium- to long-term inflation expectations falling in the surveys from the New York Fed and the University of Michigan. Although those declines may partly reflect falling gasoline prices, they provide some evidence that inflation expectations are well anchored. The data on actual inflation, however, have showed a slower decline than I had anticipated, and I am seeking to better understand the reasons. I am focused on the lag between signs of easing price pressures and actual inflation coming down from its very high levels. Much of the surge in inflation over the past year was rooted in the incomplete recovery of aggregate supply from pandemic-related shutdowns. Global supply chain disruptions had especially wide-reaching effects. This year, Russia's invasion of Ukraine sparked a surge in energy prices and affected global food markets both directly, by reducing shipments of commodities such as grain, and indirectly, by, for example, curtailing fertilizer production. In recent months, some of the upward pressure from those forces has begun to wane. Supply bottlenecks appear to be easing, and global oil and commodity prices have  declined. This largely reflects worsening global growth prospects, notably in Europe, which is suffering from the reduced flow of Russian natural gas, and in China, with its zero-COVID policy and property-sector difficulties. U.S. gasoline prices have fallen more than $1 per gallon since June, reflecting the fall in oil prices and refinery margins and helping to slow the monthly increases in headline consumer prices. However, core prices--those excluding food and energy-- have continued to rise rapidly. In particular, inflation in core goods prices has been surprisingly strong, in part because the elevated demand for goods we saw during the height of the pandemic has taken longer to abate than previously anticipated. Still, there are reasons to expect core goods inflation to slow in coming months. Wholesale used vehicle prices have declined considerably, but there is some uncertainty about how long it will take for that decline to show up in consumer prices. Similarly, new car prices should moderate over time as production of new vehicles continues to ramp up. Overall, a broad range of goods have seen declines in supplier delivery times and freight prices. And core import prices have fallen in each of the past four months, driven by lower commodity prices and an appreciating dollar. Although supply constraints in goods appear to be easing, we cannot assume that improvement will be steady. Globally, at least one potential snag is the possible reduction in Russian oil supply later this year when European sanctions come into full force. As we saw with drought in Europe and China and the floods in Pakistan, extreme weather conditions may also disrupt global supplies of food and other commodities. Domestically, the recent threat of a rail strike, though averted, highlights the existence of latent risks that could result in further negative supply shocks.  Consumer prices continue to rise rapidly over a broad range of services as demand for services recovers. Continued strong wage increases will likely put further upward pressure on service price inflation. Housing services inflation will likely boost overall inflation well into next year. Although rent increases on new leases are starting to slow, that moderation also is likely to have a substantial and uncertain lag before it measures of inflation. The widespread nature of the inflation pressures suggests that the overall economy is very tight, with constrained supply continuing to fall short of demand. The Fed cannot act directly on supply, but it can moderate demand by tightening monetary policy. The rate hikes so far this year, coupled with expectations of further hikes and ongoing balance sheet runoff, have led to a sharp tightening of U.S. financial conditions. This has helped soften interest-sensitive components of private demand, including business investment and--most notably--housing. Indications of cooling in the housing market include declines in single-family starts and permits, existing home sales, and homebuyer and homebuilder sentiment. While there is heterogeneity across countries, high inflation is a global phenomenon. And financial conditions also have tightened abroad, as foreign central banks have raised policy rates. Some observers have raised concerns that central banks around the world, which are tightening policy to contain domestic inflation, may not be accounting for the cross-border spillovers of their policies. My role is to focus on the Fed's dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, which is a domestic mandate. My colleagues and I on the Federal Open Market  Committee (FOMC), however, are very attuned to foreign developments, including monetary policy abroad, and their effect on domestic conditions through trade and financial market channels. Sharp slowdowns in foreign economies, along with dollar appreciation, are reducing demand for U.S. exports, and financial market spillovers between the United States and abroad are a two-way street. As with almost everything else in these times, there is substantial uncertainty about the size of these spillovers. These international dimensions are among those that I consider in my risk- management approach, which I will describe in a moment. I will also address how data drive my understanding of the inflation dynamics I have outlined. The role of policymaker robs economists of one of the profession's great joys, which is to simply ruminate or expound on the vagaries of economics. In my new role, I must make judgments on the economy, weighing new information against existing theories, and translate those judgments into appropriate policy action. To a large extent, my own research and experiences shape my views on policy. My research on economic growth has given me an appreciation for the dual mandate and the importance of economic and financial stability for fostering innovation and growth. My experience working at the Council of Economic Advisers during the eurozone crisis and with emerging economies--particularly Russia and some African economies--has taught me how difficult it can be to forecast in highly uncertain environments. I also saw firsthand that it is often a mistake to rely on standard models for nonstandard situations. Paying close attention to the data is key, which, of course, includes readings on inflation and the labor market. But we must be humble about our ability to draw firm  conclusions and prepare for inevitable surprises. We also need to consider timely high- frequency data that more quickly capture evolving economic developments than do traditional data sources. Examples include wholesale used car prices, rental rates on new leases, and survey responses on supplier delivery times or prices paid. There is also nontraditional, real-time information, such as Google mobility data and Open Table data on dining reservations, which were useful in estimating economic activity during various waves of the pandemic. In considering whether standard models remain appropriate, one focus for me is the well-known long and variable lag between monetary policy actions and their effect on the real economy and on inflation. Less of a lag may exist now between rate hikes and the tightening of financial conditions, which occurs as markets anticipate future rate hikes. Residential investment also responds quickly to changes in monetary policy, while consumer spending is slower to react. Lags between monetary policy and inflation are even more unclear. Expectations of future monetary policy can have quite rapid effects on commodity and other import prices, but monetary transmission through economic slack appears to affect inflation more slowly. I believe that uncertain times require a risk-management approach to policy- setting--looking not just at the expected outcomes, but also considering the most salient risks in setting the policy stance. In the current situation, with risks to inflation forecasts skewed to the upside, I believe policy judgments must be based on whether and when we see inflation actually falling in the data, rather than just in forecasts. Although most forecasts see considerable progress on inflation in coming years, it is important to  consider whether inflation dynamics may have changed in a persistent way, making our forecasts even more uncertain. How do these experiences and the principles of data dependence and risk management influence my views on current monetary policy? In 2019, well before joining the Board, I took part in the Federal Reserve's event in Chicago. A key takeaway from was the value of a sustained strong labor market that brings people off the sidelines--those who have been on the margins but who have skills that can be developed and the desire to be part of the workforce, if given a chance. Just two weeks ago, we held another event to hear how businesses, families, and communities are adapting to changes in the post- pandemic economy. Notably, we heard about the burden that lower- and middle-income families are feeling from high inflation. These events highlighted for me the importance of achieving both our employment and price-stability mandates. In our current economy, with a very strong labor market and inflation far above our goal, I believe a risk-management approach requires a strong focus on taming inflation. Inflation poses both a near- and long-term threat. Aside from the immediate effect of higher prices on households and businesses, the longer it persists and the more people come to expect it, the greater the risks of elevated inflation becoming entrenched. I think it is critical that we prevent an inflationary psychology from taking hold. This is not simply an abstract concept, but a risk I take seriously based on personal experience. My time doing dissertation research in Russia in the mid-1990s taught me just how disruptive and painful an extremely high-inflation environment can be.  Reports over the past few months have shown high inflation to be stubbornly persistent, while the labor market has remained strong. Being data dependent, I have revised up my assessment of the persistence of high inflation. And given my risk- management approach, with upside risks to inflation being the most salient, I fully supported the step-up in the front-loading of policy over the past three FOMC meetings. Front-loading has several positive features. It puts monetary restraint into place more quickly to reduce demand while supply is constrained. It may also act to rein in inflation expectations and, as a result, to influence wage- and price-setting behavior. This preemptive approach is appropriate. Although lowering inflation will bring some pain, a failure to restore price stability would make it much harder and much more painful to restore it in the future. When I first joined the FOMC, our policy rate was still below 1 percent. In the three meetings since, we have moved expeditiously by raising rates 75 basis points at every meeting. As we move forward in these uncertain times, policy should remain focused on restoring price stability, which will also set the foundation for a sustainably strong labor market. With inflation running well above our 2 percent longer-run goal, restoring price stability likely will require ongoing rate hikes and then keeping policy restrictive for some time until we are confident that inflation is firmly on the path toward our 2 percent goal. At some point, as we continue to tighten monetary policy, it will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases while we assess the effects of our cumulative tightening on the economy and inflation. In any case, the path of policy should depend on how quickly we make progress toward our inflation goal.  In sum, inflation is too high, it must come down, and we will keep at it until the job is done. Thank you.","['unemployment', 'unemployed', 'economy', 'economists', 'easing']","['unemployment rate', 'pandemic economy', 'monetary policy', 'tightening economy', 'employment stable']","['current monetary policy', 'post pandemic economy', 'persistent labor market', 'monetary policy begin', 'pandemic economy notably']","['current monetary policy', 'unemployment rate', 'sustained strong labor market', 'strong labor market', 'future monetary policy']"

It's been a tough couple of weeks for Atlantic Canada. I want to extend my condolences for the lives lost during the terrible storm. My sympathy goes out to all of those affected across the region, including Bank of Canada employees in our office here in Halifax. The damage and destruction bring a new wave of hardship after what has already been a difficult couple of years. Canadians have faced historic challenges since 2020. And recovering from these challenges--just like rebuilding from the aftermath of Hurricane Fiona--will take time. The global COVID-19 pandemic has sparked a challenge that is particularly pressing to the Bank of Canada--high inflation. And that's what I want to talk about today. High inflation is making life more difficult for Canadians, especially those with low or fixed incomes. Some of this inflation reflects global developments that we don't control, but inflation in Canada increasingly reflects what's happening in Canada. The demand for goods and services here at home is running ahead of the economy's ability to supply them. Businesses are having a hard time finding enough workers. And what started as higher prices and delays for many internationally produced goods has broadened to many services. Inflation in Canada peaked at 8.1% in June and has declined for two months. That's welcome news, but inflation will not fade away by itself. To get it back to more normal levels, we need to slow spending in the economy so supply can catch up with demand. This will help relieve price pressures here in Canada. In September, we raised our policy interest rate for the fifth consecutive time since March. And we indicated that interest rates will likely need to go higher still to bring inflation down to the 2% target. Later this month, we will take our next monetary policy decision, and we will update our economic outlook for growth and inflation at that time. But today I want to do three things. First, I want to unpack the run-up in inflation over the past year or so and review how the factors behind inflation in Canada  are shifting from global to domestic and from goods to services. Second, I want to review the inflation indicators we are particularly focused on as we assess where inflation is headed. Finally, I want to acknowledge the hardship that high inflation is creating for many Canadians and underscore the imperative of getting inflation all the way back to the 2% target. Heading into the pandemic in 2020, Canada's total consumer price index (CPI) inflation was 2.2%--roughly on target. But when the world locked down, inflation fell steeply, dipping below zero. Prolonged deflation and economic depression were real concerns. The Bank responded with exceptional monetary support, first to put a floor under the crisis and then to help the economy regain its strength. Fortunately, combined with exceptional fiscal stimulus, it worked. We avoided deflation, and the deepest recession on record was followed by the fastest recovery ever. But repeatedly closing and reopening economies around the world brought new challenges. Households shifted their spending from in-person services to durable goods, straining global supply chains that were already disrupted by public health restrictions. Shipping bottlenecks and shortages of key intermediate inputs meant long delays for goods like cars, bicycles and appliances. So by 2021, we began experiencing higher prices for many internationally traded goods. shows, inflation in goods excluding food and energy rose to about 3.5% by July 2021, while inflation in services excluding shelter was only around 1%. Add in higher global energy prices in 2021, and goods price inflation was about 4.5% by the middle of that year. With higher goods prices, total CPI inflation was moving up in 2021 too, but it was largely a story of higher inflation for global goods spilling into Canada.  Inflation was rising in most advanced economies, and Canadian households were feeling the effects of higher global inflation ( At the time, we assessed that the effect of these global forces on inflation was likely to be transitory. Historical experience has taught us that supply disturbances typically have a temporary effect on inflation, so we tend to look through them. A year ago we expected inflation in goods prices to moderate as public health restrictions were eased, production ramped up and investment in global supply chain logistics picked up. In hindsight, that turned out to be overly optimistic. Indeed, global inflationary pressures stepped up in 2022. The unprovoked Russian invasion of Ukraine in February drove up the prices of commodities-- particularly energy and agricultural goods--and created new disruptions to already impaired global supply chains. Canadians experienced these effects almost immediately with higher gas prices at the pump and big price increases for many basic food items at the grocery store. But the other thing that changed in 2022 was inflation in the prices of services. As the economy fully reopened in the spring, pent-up demand for all the services we'd missed over the pandemic started driving up their prices, especially in areas like travel and recreation. Canadians experienced these pressures first-hand when trying to book a campsite or reserve a table at their favourite restaurant. Services price inflation rose quickly through the first half of 2022, reaching about 5% this summer. With further increases in goods prices in 2022 and a rapid rise in services prices, total CPI inflation rose sharply, reaching 8.1% in June.  Over the last two years, the pandemic and the war have affected lives and livelihoods. They have also had a profound impact on inflation. Our job at the Bank of Canada is to restore price stability. In the last two months, headline inflation in Canada has come down to 7%. This largely reflects lower gasoline prices. In mid-June, filling up in Halifax cost $2.15 a litre on average. By the end of August, that had fallen to $1.64. More generally, there is some evidence that global inflationary forces have begun to ease, though they remain elevated. A range of global commodity prices are starting, finally, to fall from their highs. Oil prices have come down, and the prices for key agricultural commodities have also eased back. In time, with lower input and transportation costs, we should see food inflation begin to come down. Supply bottlenecks have also begun to improve ( Global manufacturers report that delivery times are still longer than usual, but they are getting shorter, and input cost pressures are easing. Global shipping costs have also come down from exceptional highs. These signs of improving global supply chains are encouraging, but we can't count on easing pressure on global prices to lower inflation in Canada. At a minimum, improving global factors will take time to filter through to Canadian inflation. And the recent depreciation of the Canadian dollar in the face of USdollar strength will offset some of this global improvement by making US goods and vacations more expensive for Canadians. There is also considerable uncertainty about the evolution of global supply chains and commodity prices. The global economy remains highly disrupted by the effects of the pandemic and  the war in Ukraine. Predicting international price movements isn't easy, and the global inflation picture could change quickly. Unfortunately, we don't have much influence over that. We can't control global developments. But we can use monetary policy to influence the balance between demand and supply in the Canadian economy and therefore ease domestic inflationary pressures over time. All the signs today point to an economy that is clearly in excess demand. Labour markets remain very tight. Job vacancies have eased a little in recent months but remain exceptionally high. Our business surveys report widespread labour shortages. And wage growth has risen and continues to broaden. With demand running ahead of supply, competition is posing less of a restraint on price increases, and businesses are passing through higher input costs more quickly. As a result, higher energy and material costs are showing up in the prices of a growing list of goods and services. So even if there is some relief at the gas pumps, price pressures remain high and continue to broaden. In August, the prices of more than three-quarters of the goods and services that make up the CPI were rising faster than 3% ( Simply put, domestic inflationary pressures have yet to ease. That doesn't mean higher interest rates are not working, but it will take time. By raising interest rates, we are making it more expensive for households and businesses to borrow and therefore to spend. In five steps since March, we have raised the overnight policy rate from 0.25% to 3.25%--one of the steepest and fastest tightening cycles we've ever conducted. And we are starting to see some effect. Some interest-  rate-sensitive sectors of the economy have begun to cool. The housing market had overheated to unsustainable levels early in the pandemic due to low supply, increased demand for larger homes and low mortgage rates. With higher rates now constraining borrowing, the sector has cooled. But monetary policy takes time to work its way through the whole economy. Households or businesses making a big purchase or investment--one that requires a loan--are feeling the impact. It takes longer for monetary policy to bring down price growth in other goods and services--especially services-- because they aren't directly tied to borrowing. Instead, they adjust over time as overall spending moderates. Rogers outlined what the Bank is monitoring to guide our decisions in the months ahead. She explained that we will focus on how monetary policy is working to slow demand, how supply challenges are resolving, and, most importantly, how both inflation and inflation expectations are responding. I want to drill down on these latter two elements: measures of core, or underlying, inflation and measures of inflation expectations. These are critical guideposts for us as we seek to bring total CPI inflation all the way back to the 2% target. Core inflation As we look for a more fundamental turning point in inflation, measures of core inflation are becoming increasingly relevant. We are an inflation-targeting central bank, and we target total CPI inflation-- calculated using a basket of goods and services that represents what Canadians typically buy. But parts of the overall CPI basket are sometimes highly volatile in ways not related to broader price pressures--this can be the case for gasoline and food prices. That's why policy-makers like to look at what we call ""core"" inflation to gauge persistent price movements. Core inflation provides a sense of the underlying trend in total CPI inflation and relates more closely to the balance between demand and supply in our economy. In practice, there are different ways to measure core inflation. Traditionally, central banks in many countries have measured core inflation by excluding volatile components like food and energy. The drawback of these exclusionbased measures is that the components that are volatile can change over time-- something we have experienced in a big way in the last couple of years. We continue to monitor various exclusion-based measures of core inflation, but since 2016, the Bank has focused on three more-statistical measures of core inflation. CPI-median and CPI-trim strip out whatever is volatile at the time. The third measure, CPI-common, is based on a statistical technique that captures the  common component in the price changes across many goods and services. This captures the idea that inflation reflects a general increase in prices. We use three measures of core inflation because no single measure is best. Depending on the circumstances, one may be a better indicator of inflationary pressure, and their diversity is their strength. With inflationary pressures as strong as they are, all three measures have risen. ). What they are telling us is that even after taking out components in the CPI that are volatile or don't reflect generalized changes in prices, inflation is running about 5%. That's too high. We can also see that our core measures have yet to decline meaningfully even though total CPI inflation has come down in the last couple of months. Going forward, we will be watching our measures of core inflation closely for clear evidence of a turning point in underlying inflation. Of our three measures, CPI-common is becoming more difficult to use in real time because it has been subject to large historical revisions. With price movements becoming much more generalized in the last year, what is included in the common component has changed considerably. CPI-trim and CPImedian, in contrast, are more robust to changes in the behaviour of prices.  These measures appear to have performed well and have been subject to much smaller revisions. With this in mind, we are more focused on these two measures and we are reassessing CPI-common. The extreme events of the pandemic have stressed Canadians. They have also stressed some of our indicators and highlighted the benefits of using a variety of measures. Inflation expectations In addition to measures of inflation, we are also closely watching inflation expectations. Keeping longer-term expectations of inflation well anchored is paramount so that, as inflation pressures ease, inflation returns to the 2% target. The longer high inflation persists and the more pervasive it becomes, the greater the risk that high inflation becomes entrenched. In particular, if high inflation pushes wages up and higher labour costs then push inflation up further, inflation expectations can become unmoored and high inflation can become self-fulfilling. We can't let that happen because if it does, it will be much more costly to return inflation to target. That's why we are so focused on measures of expected inflation. We use a range of surveys and market-based measures to assess expectations of future inflation, and they show us that near-term expectations have risen. Survey results also indicate that consumers and businesses are more uncertain about future inflation and more of them expect inflation to be higher for longer. So far, longer-term inflation expectations remain reasonably well anchored, but we are acutely aware that Canadians will need to see inflation clearly coming down to sustain this confidence. This increased uncertainty heightens the risk that inflation expectations could become de-anchored. Both households and businesses view inflation pressures as mostly global, but increasingly they are identifying domestic pressures--this is similar to our own view. Results from our next consumer and business surveys, which we will release later this month, will be important for our assessment of how expectations have evolved. It's time for me to conclude. Low, stable and predictable inflation is fundamental to a well-functioning economy with sustained growth and shared prosperity. That's why price stability is the main objective of monetary policy in Canada. Without price stability, nothing works well. High and unpredictable inflation creates uncertainty and unfairness, distorting decisions and undermining confidence in our economic system. It erodes the value of money. It distorts and confuses the information and incentives that consumers, entrepreneurs, savers and investors rely on to make their economic  decisions. That means workers and businesses have less to show for their work, and it's harder for everyone to plan for the future. Plain and simple, high inflation feeds frustration and creates a sense of helplessness. We want an economy where households and businesses don't have to guess where inflation is going to be. We want an economy where the money Canadians earn from their hard work keeps its value. We want an economy where businesses have the confidence to invest. And we want an economy where workers make real wage gains underpinned by rising productivity. That is why we have taken forceful action to restore price stability. We have raised our policy interest rate by three percentage points this year in five steps, and we are reinforcing these increases with quantitative tightening. Looking ahead, the Governing Council recognizes that it will take time for past interest rate increases to have their full effect on the economy and inflation. That's why we'll be carefully assessing the effects of our actions as we seek to slow spending and return inflation to the 2% target. Canadian economic data over the summer have come in largely in line with our July outlook, and forwardlooking indicators suggest the economy is slowing. However, labour markets remain tight, the economy is in excess demand, and we have yet to see clear evidence that underlying inflation has come down. When combined with stillelevated near-term inflation expectations, the clear implication is that further interest rate increases are warranted. Simply put, there is more to be done. We will need additional information before we consider moving to a more finely balanced decision-by-decision approach. We know we are still a long way from the 2% target. We know it will take some time to get there. We also know there could be setbacks along the way, and we can't afford to let high inflation become entrenched. Atlantic Canadians will rebuild after this storm as they always have. And the Bank of Canada will control inflation as it has for the last 30 years. We are resolute in our commitment to restore price stability for all Canadians.

6133,r221006a_BOE,united kingdom,2022-10-06,Current monetary policy,haskel,0,"The current institutional arrangements for monetary policy delivered more than two decades of low and stable inflation. Yet, central banks failed to prevent a burst of high inflation in 2021-22. This paper inspects four tentative hypotheses for why this happened. The first is a misdiagnosis of the nature of shocks during a time of great uncertainty leading to an overly long period of expansionary policy. The second is a neglect of expectations data driven by a strong belief that inflation expectations were firmly anchored and so inflation increases would be temporary. The third is an over-reliance on the credibility earned in the past, creating an illusion of too much room to focus on the recovery of real activity and underpredicting the resulting inflation. The fourth is a revision of strategy that made central banks tolerant of higher inflation because of the trend fall in the return on government bonds, even though the return on private capital stayed high. Inflation in most western advanced economies has been rising at a fast pace since the middle of 2021. It was tempting (and too common) at the time to dismiss this rise in one of two ways. During the first half of 2021, some noted that there was a normal catch up of the price level after its sharp fall in 2020 during the pandemic. But this correction became a persistent acceleration by the second half of 2021, which gained further momentum in the first half of 2022, well beyond any reasonable catchup. Another dismissal came from remembering how central bankers had worried that inflation might be stuck at too low of a level between 2014 and 2019, for instance hovering around 1% and 1.5% in the Eurozone. Maybe a year or so of higher than 2% inflation was to be welcome. But, in April of 2022, the one-year inflation rate was 9.0%, 6.3%, and 7.5% in the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Eurozone, respectively. Quantitatively, inflation is so far above target that concerns of the recent past that inflation was too low seemed trivial. Policy makers are worried, as they should be. More than a decade ago, Charles Evans, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and the current longest-sitting member of the percent against our inflation objective of 2 percent. Is there a doubt that any central banker worth their salt would be reacting strongly to fight this high inflation rate? No, there isn't any doubt. They would be acting as if their hair was on fire"" (Evans 2011). Today, the reality of inflation is already well beyond Evans' imagination, and some central bankers are feeling the heat in their heads. How did we get to this dramatic situation? The following discussion puts forward four factors behind the recent rise in inflation. The guiding framework is the principle that, ultimately, monetary policy can control inflation. That control is far from perfect, coming with unavoidable misses, and often it is desirable to let inflation deviate from 2% for some time to try to meet other objectives. But, common to all four factors, is a presumption that inflation rose because monetary policy became used to a state of affairs in the past decade and took too long to shift its stance. Rather than highlighting isolated mistakes in judgment, I point instead to underlying forces that created a tolerance for inflation that persisted even after the deviation from target became large. These factors suggest reforms for the future, as well as ways to put out the fire. Perhaps they are of use to the central bankers proving that they are worth their salt. I focus the discussion and the references on the ECB and the Federal Reserve, although the points apply more broadly to other central banks in advanced economies. Before looking at what happened in 2021-22, it is important to step back, and recall how exceptional the previous three decades had been. Between 1995 and 2020, almost every major advanced economy enjoyed a remarkable period of price stability. I first produced a version of figure 1 in 2017 for a conference discussing the twenty years of independence of the Bank of England. It shows eight centuries of inflation in the United Kingdom, split into 20-year periods for which I computed the average and the standard deviation of inflation. Eight hundred years is a long time, and it included many experiments with monetary policy: from the gold standard to floating exchange rates, with monetarism and Bretton Woods thrown in the mix. Some of them got close to the recent past in terms of achieving an average inflation rate near 2%, but they had much higher volatility. A few had low volatility, but those came with persistent deflation. None worked as well in delivering low and stable inflation as the regime of the last twenty years. Never had monetary policy been so successful at controlling inflation as it had been in the two decades What does this successful regime consist of? In my view, it is based on three pillars. The first is granting central banks independence from the Ministry of Finance, so that managing the public debt and helping to balance the public finances is no longer a job for monetary policy, and no longer overrides concerns about inflation. It is also important to have independence from governments seeking re-election so that monetary policy is not systematically used to stimulate the economy temporarily, a pursuit that often proves fruitless but results in high and volatile inflation. The second pillar is the required balance to the first: for a public institution to have the power that we confer upon central bankers, then its mandate must be narrow, its actions transparent, and its performance measurable and routinely measured. The public has given central banks an inflation target that satisfies all these criteria. The third pillar is the primacy of interest rates as the main tool of monetary policy, set in transparent and predictable ways. For most of this time, the interest rate was a short-term rate closely controlled by the central bank, but the period after the great financial crisis saw central banks ""go long"" by pursuing policies that would temporarily steer long-term interest rates in government bonds. Throughout, central bankers followed clear principles--like the Taylor rule or gradualism--that made their actions rule-like in allowing the private sector to understand where policy was heading and why. There are endless debates on whether these three pillars are necessary or sufficient to deliver price stability. But it is unlikely it was a coincidence that inflation was so low and stable in a whole host of countries that followed these same three pillars, at different times and in different circumstances. I raise them because I fear that in the near future valid criticisms of central bankers' choices in the last year, or understandable outrages at how high and persistent inflation becomes, can lead to overreactions and entirely new regimes that come with volatility and may fail. The last twenty years showed that independent central banks setting interest rates to hit inflation targets can succeed. The water may need some cleaning or some change, but the baby should stay in it. The years 2021 and 2022 saw large and unusual shocks hitting the economy. The job of central banks was especially difficult, and choices were made amidst great uncertainty on what the state of the economy was in real time and what the nature and persistence of the shocks affecting inflation were. The first and major shock was, of course, the pandemic of 2020. At first, it justified a remarkable degree of monetary stimulus since there were legitimate fears of a depression. The Federal Reserve announced a schedule of asset purchases that made its balance sheet expand to a record share of GDP. The ECB gave forward guidance that deposit rates would stay negative extending well beyond one year. Perhaps over-influenced by the experience of the great financial crisis, many expected long-lasting scars from the Covid recession. Avoiding a slump demanded a strong response. Instead, the economy rebounded quickly before 2020 was even over. Between the trough euro area. The unemployment rate fell by more than 10% in less than twelve months in the United States. Instead of scars and hysteresis, the economy showed an ability to intertemporally substitute production and consumption. After the lockdown of the second quarter of 2020, the economy responded in the third quarter with intense re-opening and economic activity. The private sectors became better at this intertemporal substitution with time, and when a larger health shock came at the end of 2020 with the delta wave (in number of infections, deaths, or any other health indicator) together with new lockdowns, the fall in production was smaller for the euro area, and inexistent for the United States. Figure 2 shows how quick, relative to its depth, the recovery was in comparison with the other recessions since the start of the century. Macroeconomic policy deserves credit for this fast recovery. The social insurance programs of 2020 likely contributed to minimizing the scars and prevented consumers from becoming persistently pessimistic and unwilling to work or consume. Almost no bank failed during this time, and there was no significant crisis in any relevant financial market. At the same time, the recovery came with inflation. The framework of the Phillips curve says that deviation from steady state inflation can come from three direct channels. The first is the expected inflation by households and firms. The second is a deviation of real activity from a potential level of output that is determined by technology and costs. The third is a markup shock that introduces a gap between the potential and efficient levels of output. While different models of price stickiness come with different concrete causes behind each of these three forces, this organizing framework has repeatedly been useful to interpret inflation dynamics arising from shocks. The fast recovery is an example of the second force driving inflation up. Because tighter monetary policy can work through the same force in the opposite direction, it can stabilize the output gap and inflation with it. However, monetary policy was kept loose in 2021. Additionally, the direct transfers to households and firms in 2020 had led to an accumulation of savings and an explosion in broad monetary aggregates that provided the balances for a boom in spending once the economy re-opened. The fiscal stimulus at the start of 2021 in the United States (the American Rescue Plan of 2021) further raised aggregate demand, likely to a level above the potential output of the economy. The amount of fiscal and monetary stimulus in 2020 was perhaps excessive, although this judgement comes with the benefit of hindsight. A more pertinent criticism is that policy did not reverse course until at least the end of 2021, even as the signs that the fast recovery was leading to overheating became clearer. This slow reversal is perhaps best explained by the forward guidance given in 2020, serving as a constraint in 2021 on what central banks thought was admissible without defrauding expectations. A second set of shocks compounded the inflation problem in 2021. They had their origin in the supply sector. At different times during the year, ports became clogged, the production of microchips hit capacity constraints, and global value chains broke down as new waves of the pandemic led to a closing of borders. These bottlenecks are shocks to the supply of goods in the economy that reflected themselves differently in different countries. Yet, the diagnosis of central banks was similar across the advanced economies. In terms of the Phillips curve, policy makers interpreted all these shocks as temporary markup shocks, the third channel. As such, they concluded that they should not reverse the stimulus stance of monetary policy and not jeopardize the recovery. The standard monetary policy prescription against a temporary markup shock is to let inflation rise above target so that, even if actual output rises above potential, it stays close (or slightly below) the efficient level of output. This diagnosis was suspect, both at the time and in hindsight. Many of these shocks can just as well be interpreted as shocks to the potential level of output. For instance, the problem with global supply chains affects the actual technology used to produce goods, not just the market power of firms. Moreover, if the shape of globalization is going to change, as some have argued, this will most likely affect the productive capacity of the economy. So, if inflation was rising because of the second channel through lower potential output, as opposed to the third through higher deviations from the efficient level of output, the policy prescription would be instead to tighten monetary policy and to keep inflation on target. Simply put, persistent and recurrent negative supply shocks to potential output will make the economy poorer: inflation cannot change this, nor can monetary policy. Energy prices were the third shock. They had been rising since 2021, and sharply increased in 2022 with the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The ECB responded again as if this was a temporary markup shock, as opposed to a shock to potential output. Policy tolerated a sharp increase in inflation, predicting it to be short-lived. It was a defensible priority to strive to avoid mistakes of the past, when hikes in oil prices would raise inflation, trigger tighter monetary policy, and cause a recession. Yet this ""see through the shock"" policy is a prescription of the literature only if inflation expectations are anchored. Otherwise, the sharp increase in the prices of energy will have an over- sized impact on household expectations as the first channel of the Phillips curve becomes operative, further pushing inflation up. Not only did central banks again interpret a supply shock as being a shock to markups, as opposed to potential output, but they relied on expectations being anchored. Yet, large changes in household costs of energy are salient to households and can easily unsettle their expectations. Three times in a row in a short period of time, a set of shocks pushed inflation up. Three times in a row, monetary policy interpreted them using the lenses of the Phillips curve in the direction that concluded that monetary policy should be kept loose. Three times in a row, this diagnosis was plausibly right but disputable, and the risk was that inflation would rise too much and too persistently. After the fact, in all three cases this risk became reality. A policy framework should be robust to shocks, and it should correct misdiagnoses. So many successive errors in the same direction indicate more systematic problems. The next three factors point to three such problems. No central banker would deny the importance of inflation expectations for the control of inflation. Over the last decade, expected inflation was very sticky, so that its measurements reflected mostly noise with little signal. Household surveys of inflation expectations invariably returned an answer of 2%, which in every wave was polluted by measurement error. Only through careful econometric work were researchers able to uncover interesting patterns that allowed for scientific progress in understanding expectations and inflation. In turn, data from financial markets likewise reflected mostly changes in risk attitudes as well as financial shocks which introduced noise beyond the expected inflation signal. Inflation expectations were solidly anchored because of the success of the past. Staffers at the forecasting team of central banks were justified in ignoring expectations data in their econometric models (Coibion et al., 2018). The experience of 2020 confirmed this view. Despite a few months of sharp deflation, followed by sharp month-to-month inflation, expectations of inflation stayed remarkably stable. The trust that central banks placed in the anchor is evident in the speech by Jerome Powell at the expectations and concludes that: ""Households, businesses, and market participants also believe that current high inflation readings are likely to prove transitory and that, in any case, the Fed will keep inflation close to our 2 percent objective over time"" (Powell 2021). There was nothing to see, and the anchor was firmly in the seabed. In fact, before inflation started rising, central bankers were mostly worried about the possibility that expectations might be anchored at levels of inflation that were too low. In the presentation of the Federal Reserve's new framework in the 2020 Jackson Hole speech, Powell discussed the problem of an ""adverse cycle of ever-lower inflation and inflation expectations"" economy is close to the lower bound, this requires especially forceful or persistent monetary policy measures to avoid negative deviations from the inflation target becoming entrenched"" (European Relying on anchored inflation expectations and focusing on the downside risk has consequences for monetary policy. First, with expected inflation equal to a constant in the Phillips curve framework, one of the main drivers of inflation is absent. Second, a temporary rise in inflation expectations is welcome. If the fear is that of a deflation trap, then a rise in inflation expectations is a way to escape the adverse cycle in the Powell quote above. Third, a rise in actual inflation is likely to be transitory. If expectations stay anchored, they pull inflation towards them, making most inflation shocks temporary. These three consequences are interlinked: if expectations are solidly anchored, then even sharp rises in inflation will only move them up a little, with no risk that the anchor would go adrift. However, already halfway through the year 2021, the data showed that expectations were not so well-anchored. In line with modern research, the key was to look beyond the measure of central tendency from household surveys and to focus on measures of disagreement. Figure 3 shows three snapshots of the distribution of one-year ahead inflation expectations in the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers household expectations. In the first half of 2021, the skewness started rising. That is, a rising share of households started expecting that inflation would be higher, even as the median changed little. Then, it was the standard deviation that rose decisively as more and more households joined the group of pessimists. By 2022, the shift of the distribution to the right was such that the median was rising quickly as well. This three-stage movement in the distribution of expectations is not unique to 2021-22. Looking back to the end of the 1960s in the United States, again the distribution of survey inflation expectations shifted slowly to the right, and this was seen first through an increase in skewness, then a rise in standard deviation, and finally the rise in the median (Reis, 2022a). This process took a few years back then, as opposed to less than one year in 2021-22, but qualitatively it was similar. In the other direction, between 1980 and 1985, as inflation sharply came down, again it was first skewness, then standard deviation, and finally median that moved as the distribution shifted to its new anchor. Another common feature of these three episodes is that the surveys of professionals lagged those of households, and after the fact turned out to be the more sluggish and less informative source of data. In normal times, the opposite happens, as household survey data lags professional surveys and is less accurate, but during these three past large changes in inflation, household data were more informative. The data in 2021 revealed that a large change in expectations was under way. The expectations anchor had left the seabed after a couple of decades during which it had barely moved. Perhaps this was the result of the shocks that hit the economy, or perhaps it was a result of the loose monetary policy that accompanied them. Bad luck played a role, as some of the relative prices that moved the most in 2021 (like gas prices or cars) were among those most visible to consumers, who will tend to overreact to them when forming their expectations. Once central banks allowed inflation to rise, those realizations themselves fed into households anticipating higher expected future inflation. A temporary inflation shock becomes persistent if the expectations anchor moves with it. Sharp movements in expected inflation over the next year are alarming for the persistence of the shock. But if expectations of the distant future continue to be stable, the damage for inflation will be limited. The credibility of an inflation-targeting central bank is ultimately measured by whether expected long-run inflation is equal to its target. In the long run, money is neutral, the Phillips curve is (nearly) vertical, and expected inflation matches actual inflation. If the central bank manages to convince economic agents that inflation in the long run will be on target, then most of the work of keeping its actual value on target in the long run will have been done. In 2021, it was justified to rely on having significant credibility. After all, such credibility had been earned after more than 20 years of inflation very close to 2%. Central banks can enjoy a ""capital of inattention"" in that people do not pay much attention to what the central bank is doing, trusting it will deliver inflation on target over the next few years. One important consequence of this credibility is that it will make the negative relation between inflation and real activity appear to be flatter. As people and firms are inattentive, and update their wages and prices less often, the extent of nominal rigidities in the economy rises, making monetary policy more powerful in affecting real activity. Relying on this credibility, the central bank can exploit short-run tradeoffs between inflation and real activity to try to improve welfare. Policy makers will appear more ""dovish"" because mistakes in policies are more likely to cause recessions than to cause high inflation. In 2021, facing an unusual amount of uncertainty about the shocks hitting the economy and their ability to measure fast-moving indicators, central banks leaned heavily on their credibility by allowing inflation to rise above target to offset the impact of these shocks on real activity. As long as they had credibility, inflation would only rise moderately. It is hard to survey households on what they expect inflation to be in the distant future. Instead, the dominant measure of credibility comes from financial markets. The most used measure is the 5-year, 5-year forward inflation expected rate. Using either inflation swaps or nominal and inflation-indexed bonds over 5- and 10-year horizons, it computes what the expected inflation will be starting in 5 years, on average over the succeeding 5 years. Looking at April 21, 2020, 2021, and 2022, this measure increased from 1.34% to 2.13% and then to 2.67%, respectively, in the United States. Since market measures include a premium for inflation risk, even the more recent number is maybe only slightly above a 2% inflation target. However, again the average hides what is behind it in the distribution. Looking beyond the mean gives more cause for alarm. Recent research has developed methods to use option prices to inspect these distributions and, especially, to accurately capture the probabilities of the tails (Hilscher et al, 2022). The top panel of figure 4 shows these distributions for the 10-year horizon in the United States throughout 2021. While the average rose little, there was a clear shift to the right. Especially during the second half of the year, this shift came with a quick accumulation of mass on the right tail. The distributions became increasingly asymmetric as upside risks to inflation became dominant. a. Probability densities for average risk-adjusted inflation over the next ten years b. Tail probabilities of a 5-year, 5-year inflation disaster in US and EZ inflation The bottom panel of figure 4 focuses on that right tail by presenting probabilities that reflect how much market participants are willing to pay to insure themselves against an ""inflation disaster,"" a scenario where inflation is persistently higher. To do so, these estimates adjust the tails from the top panel to take out the compensation for risk, and they set the horizon to 5-year, 5-year so as to focus on credibility, as opposed to pessimism about the immediate few years. The numbers therefore measure the current date market-perceived probability that average inflation will be more than 4% starting in 5 years, over the following 5 years. If central bankers are risk managers, they should care more about these disasters than about the average outcome that was so often cited in In the United States, this probability rose steadily from the middle of 2021 onwards. By the last date in this sample, April of 2022, it was 16%. Investors were paying a high price to insure against the chance that the Federal Reserve would, considerably and persistently, miss its inflation target between 2027 and 2032. This reveals a lack of credibility of the Federal Reserve. Credibility in the inflation target of the ECB stayed high until the end of 2021. But then, the perceived disaster probability jumped up very quickly to 8%. This is less than in the United States, but it still puts a considerable dent into the faith that credibility has remained intact. Seeing these numbers, relying on credibility of the inflation target to offset policy shocks by letting inflation rise is a bold and risky move. In 2019, both the Federal Reserve and the ECB announced they would be revising the framework that guides their monetary policies. When presenting the result of this work at the 2020 Jackson Hole conference, Jerome Powell cited as one of its important motivations the ""...fall in the equilibrium real interest rate, or 'r-star.'"" In turn, in the overview document that the ECB released presenting its own reviews, the first justification offered for why it was needed was that ""structural developments have lowered the equilibrium real rate of interest."" This r-star refers to the real interest rate at which savings are equal to investment and output is at its potential. It is often interpreted and measured as the long-run steady state for real returns in the economy. Sometimes it is called the neutral rate of interest because, in New Keynesian models, having the nominal interest rate of the central bank above r-star plus the inflation target captures contractionary policy. Conversely, if the policy rate is below r-star plus 2%, then policy is understood to be expansionary, putting upwards pressure on inflation. R-star is difficult to estimate because it is observed in an equilibrium that is never reached but estimates that it has fallen make it more likely that monetary policy is contractionary for any given level of the policy rate. If r-star is indeed lower, it is more likely that when the central bank needs to lower policy rates aggressively to push up inflation, it will find itself unable to do so. It would require policy rates that are below their ""effective lower bound"" (ELB). Therefore, monetary policy will sometimes be insufficiently expansionary. In principle, this would lead to too little inflation. The central bank can ""go long,"" trying to affect longer-term interest rates by using forward guidance and quantitative easing to provide further expansion, but this may not be enough. Matters can get worse. If agents start expecting deflation, and the central bank cannot lower interest rates, then this breakdown of the Taylor principle because of the ELB makes deflation self-fulfilling. As Powell's 2020 speech noted, in that case, the economy may enter an ""adverse cycle of ever-lower inflation and inflation expectations,"" leading the economy to become stuck in a deflation trap. A long academic literature suggests that, to escape this trap, central banks must find a way to commit to delivering high inflation, above the target, in the future. Future higher inflation would boost current inflation, and on average deliver inflation on target. An emphasis on a low r-star also leads to a focus on providing stimulus to aggregate demand. In economies at the ELB, aggregate demand is too low. The economy is persistently operating below capacity, so that the looser monetary policy can be, the better. This logic extends to fiscal policy, and thus to embracing large deficits and to not worrying about the public debt (which, anyway, now pays a lower interest rate). Policies based on supply, in contrast, are less important. At the ELB, the opportunity cost of liquidity is close to zero, so firms should have access to abundant liquidity and credit. Improvements in aggregate productivity may even backfire and lower output if they lower inflation expectations. Putting it all together, if r-star has fallen, then central banks increasingly start to worry about deflation because of inevitably tight monetary policy even with interest rates near zero. They welcome inflation rising above target, and they focus on perpetually boosting real activity and providing more and more stimulus. Both the Federal Reserve and the ECB's mission reviews moved in this direction. But has r-star fallen? Figure 5 shows that the ex-post return on long-term government bonds has fallen in the G- 7 countries over the last twenty or thirty years. Short-term government bond yields were close to the ELB for many years including 2021. Monetary policy was certainly constrained in providing more stimulus. But the theoretical concept of r-star refers to an equilibrium between savings and investment in the overall economy. Why would this happen in the government bond market? In fact, in the standard neoclassical growth model that defines the output potential in many modern macroeconomic models, the interest rate on government bonds is irrelevant, as government bonds are not net wealth. It is the marginal product of capital (and time preferences) that determine where savings equal investment. The return on government bonds is only useful because with efficient and complete capital markets, it provides a risk-free measure of the relevant r-star, which conceptually is the return to capital in the economy. Closer to the concept of r-star is to measure the return on investing in the private capital stock. Doing so using financial returns is a thankless task because, as the Modigliani-Miller theorem states, the return on capital can be split in many ways between different financial claims, and these have likely changed over time. Instead, figure 5 shows a measure of the return to capital using the income flows in the aggregate economy. Namely, it starts with value added in the economy, subtracts payments to labor and depreciation, and divides it by the private capital stock. It is therefore a measure of the average return from owning capital in the economy every year, whether those came from profits or costs of finance, or from the payout of loans, bonds, dividends, or others. This measure of r-star has been remarkably constant over the last twenty years. There is no downward trend in it. There has been a trend increase in the difference between the return in the private economy and the return on government bonds. Perhaps this is a sign of misallocation of capital away from private investment in the capital stock and towards financial investments. It may also reflect an inability of capital markets to fund enough investment to bring the marginal product of capital down. Or, perhaps it reflects an increasing ""specialness"" of government bonds in providing safety, liquidity, convenience, or some other service that attracts an excess demand for them and justifies their paying an inferior return. Whichever it is, the data suggests that r-star may have been constant, or it may have fallen, but the difference between private and public returns has definitely risen. This perspective--non-decreasing return to private capital and an increasing wedge between it and the return on public debt--changes the focus of monetary policy (Reis, 2022b). First, promising to increase inflation in the future to raise inflation expectations becomes less appealing. Doing so still lowers the real interest rate on government bonds and boosts consumption at the ELB, so it is still an effective policy. However, now it only raises investments if it can reduce the real return on the private capital stock, which it ","['inflation', 'macroeconomic', 'recessions', 'keynesian', 'recession']","['inflation 2021', 'worried inflation', 'current inflation', 'inflation trend', 'future inflation']","['inflation 2021 facing', 'high inflation 2021', 'promising increase inflation', 'rise inflation expectations', 'inflation expectations leading']","['current inflation', 'anchored inflation expectations', 'future higher inflation', 'ahead inflation expectations', 'inflation rise']"
6134,r221007a_BOE,united kingdom,2022-10-07,"Shocks, inflation, and the policy response",ramsden,0,"Thank you very much for the invitation to speak today. As one of the nine members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) I am going to use my time today to set out my thinking on the shocks that are hitting the UK economy, what these mean for the outlook for inflation and what the MPC is doing in response to return inflation sustainably to our 2 per cent target in the medium term. Fulfilling our remit matters for everyone in the UK and for everyone attending this conference. Because history tells us that low and stable inflation provides the best conditions for durable investment and innovation, which are in turn key ingredients for sustainable growth. back in February also on the theme of shocks. That there is enough material for a sequel less than eight months later highlights just what an unusual period this is in terms of the number and scale of shocks and the impacts they are having. Let me start by saying what I mean by shocks. Economists, along with other professions, have lots of different ways of identifying and categorising shocks and their implications . For today's purposes shocks are new, unanticipated developments which are clearly distinguishable from more routine developments. As an MPC member I want to try and bring out how I've been thinking about each shock in terms of the impact on demand or supply in the economy and the time frame over which these impacts persist. Demand being what we actually observe in terms of output, income and expenditure. Supply being more about the capacity of the economy. In terms of inflation, if a shock pushes up demand relative to supply then inflationary pressures are likely to build. Similarly if an unanticipated development pushes up supply relative to demand then inflationary pressures will subside. Back in February I focused on Brexit, the coronavirus pandemic and energy prices as three major shocks which were working through the economy. Today I want to cover four developments since then: the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the fall in UK labour market participation, UK fiscal policy and financial market turbulence. All four of these shocks matter to differing degrees to the economic outlook and to our policy response My February speech was two days before Russia began its illegal invasion of Ukraine. Today is Day 225 of the ensuing war and over that period global energy prices (as well as food and other prices) have risen further and also been highly volatile, particularly in the case of wholesale gas prices. To illustrate this, at the time of the MPC's last forecast in August 2022 the gas futures price for 2022Q4, the quarter we have just started, was seven times higher than what was expected in our August 2021 forecast. Gas prices have been very volatile since. At the time of the August MPR, Bank staff estimated that the annual energy bill for a typical household under the OFGEM price cap would rise from just under PS2000 to around PS3500 from 1 October, a 75 per cent increase and three times higher than the equivalent bill in October 2021. In the face of these very large prospective increases, on 8 September the Government announced an Energy Price Guarantee, which came into effect on 1 October, a fiscal shock which I will come back to. For the UK economy a key characteristic of the global energy shock is that it depresses supply. The UK is a net importer of energy so national income will be lower; the UK economy is poorer. These effects were already apparent before Russia's invasion of Ukraine but the war has exacerbated them, and even with the Guarantee households and businesses will be worse off due to higher energy bills than they were a year ago, intensifying the problems associated with the cost of living. The increase in energy prices has been a significant contributor to inflation over the last year in the UK and the Euro area. In August UK CPI inflation was 9.9%, and a third of the total was directly accounted for by energy . The further indirect effects are likely to be material and have been a factor in the marked pickup in CPI services inflation to 5.9% in August, contributing over 2% to the total. Contributions to annual consumer price inflation The second noteworthy development is the trend in UK labour participation. This looks like being one of the most significant economic legacies of the pandemic. Around the turn of the year there were signs that the recovery in the economy was bringing people back in to the labour market; a version of the ""encouraged worker"" effect which is often seen during cyclical upturns. However these signs petered out, and by July 2022 there were about 500,000 fewer people classed as participating in the labour market than pre-pandemic. In this way the UK stands out compared with most other major economies; the UK participation rate is 0.7 percentage points lower than 2019 levels whereas the median OECD country participation rate is 0.7 percentage points higher . It's not clear what is driving this participation puzzle . But whatever is behind it, low participation is a key component of the tightness in the UK labour market. Employment growth has slowed but unemployment has fallen to 3.6% - the lowest rate since 1974 - the number of vacancies also remain close to record highs and the redundancy rate remains close to its record low. Moreover, regular pay growth in the private sector has continued to rise to 6% in July 2022. The decline in participation is another negative supply shock which is at present impacting on an already tight labour market and adding to the upward pressure on nominal wages. The MPC has made successive revisions to our assessment, each time forecasting the labour market will stay tighter for longer. This tightness has been a key consideration in my MPC votes over the last year . Models estimated by Bank staff indicate that the pickup in underlying private sector pay growth so far has been driven not just by the tightening labour market but also the rise in short term inflation expectations . While the latter probably reflects higher headline inflation itself, a point I will come back to, these factors are expected to push up pay growth in the near term. This would be consistent with the message of the latest surveys by the Bank's Agents which suggest pay growth will strengthen further. The third development I want to draw out is the significant recent news on fiscal policy. But before explaining why this matters for monetary policy I will make a couple of points about the role of the MPC and how we treat fiscal policy in our forecasts. First, it is not part of the remit of the MPC to comment on whether a particular tax or spending policy is the right action to take or whether the overall stance of fiscal policy is appropriate. However it is part of our job to comment on and respond, as necessary, to the impact individual measures or the overall stance of fiscal policy have on demand and inflation. Fiscal policy rightly came to the fore during the pandemic, and the furlough scheme in particular was a major fiscal intervention which provided very significant support to demand and to the labour market, up until it ended a year ago. Second there is a long-standing convention that the MPC only factors announced fiscal policy into its forecasts and actions. With those two points in mind I want to distinguish between two types of fiscal news over the last month; those that the MPC has factored in to its decisions already and those that it has yet to. In the first category on 8 September the government announced the Energy Price Guarantee scheme which will cap energy bills to PS2500 for the typical household and for businesses. The Guarantee will therefore insulate households and businesses and the broader economy from the direct impacts of further shocks to energy prices. As such it represents another very significant fiscal intervention, which can be thought as a shock which supports demand relative to what it would otherwise have been. The MPC was able to take account of the Guarantee, based on an initial assessment of its impact, at its September meeting. In the second category of fiscal news which the MPC has not yet incorporated, on 23 September the Government announced its Growth Plan which contained a range of fiscal measures, particularly on the tax side. The Government has followed this up with further policy announcements, and has also set out that it will publish its Fiscal Plan on 23 November, alongside an updated forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility. The MPC will be able to make its own assessment of the impact on demand and inflation of the Growth Plan during its next forecast round leading up to its next decision meeting on 2 November. Based on what we know so far, these impacts are likely to be material for the economic outlook over the next three years, which is also the horizon relevant for monetary policy. The final shock I want to talk about is the recent turbulence in financial markets. The MPC's forecasts are conditioned on assumptions for the outlook for various asset prices and so these movements could have a significant direct effect on the November forecasts and for the Committee's broader assessment of financial conditions. Financial markets globally have been volatile over recent months, with notable rises in government bond yields, large moves in exchange rates and falls in risky asset prices. Overall the adjustment in market prices has been consistent with tighter monetary policy globally and the deterioration in the economic outlook. These trends were more marked for the UK through August and up to the September MPC meeting. But the UK began to really stand out over the last fortnight, which has seen significant moves in the pricing of UK financial assets. Part of that re-pricing continues to reflect broader global developments. But there is undoubtedly a UK-specific component. The sterling exchange rate in ERI terms has fallen by 7% since the start of the year, partly in the context of a strong dollar, but while it has continued to be volatile it is broadly unchanged since the September MPC meeting. Recent moves in the prices of government bonds, gilts, have been more striking. At the benchmark 10 year point, yields have risen steadily through the year globally . But having tracked US and Euro area yields since the start of the year, UK yields have risen more markedly through August and especially sharply over the last fortnight since the announcement of the Government's Growth Plan. Decompositions of the drivers of the shock to yields point to domestic UK factors as driving the increase over the most recent period, which is unusual. . These longer term trends overlaid by the very recent market turbulence are impacting on the real economy in many ways. A key channel is obviously through the interest rates faced by households and businesses when they want to borrow, for example to buy houses or to invest. Fixed-rate mortgages have become increasingly popular in recent years and now represent 95 per cent of the flow of new lending and 80 per cent of the stock. Two-year fixed-rate products are particularly popular and their cost to the lenders who provide them is derived from two-year interest rate swaps. A year ago the two-year swap rate was 0.5%, a month ago it was 4%, after the 22 September MPC meeting it was close to 4.5% and at yesterday's market close it was around 5.4% having peaked at nearly 6% in the intervening fortnight. . The Bank's latest figures for quoted mortgage rates in September were published this morning. Because these are averages for the month they lag somewhat market measures, but the increases are still marked. Quoted mortgages rates on two-year fixed rate mortgages increased by around 50bps between August and September and were up by nearly 300bps compared to last September and have been rising further into the start of October. Recently lenders have also withdrawn a large number of mortgage products from the market because of the turbulent market conditions. UK-specific factors also have had a particular effect on the price of long-dated UK government debt, which fell very sharply over a very short period, leading to dysfunction which, had it continued or worsened, would have been a material risk to UK financial stability. The Bank started intervening in this segment of the gilt market on 28 September, in a time-limited and temporary way. Because this is not a monetary policy operation - although it involves buying assets I think of it as an operation designed to buy time - I won't say any more about it here . Markets continue to be volatile and so extracting any signals from the noise is even more challenging than usual. One key consideration for the MPC at its upcoming meetings will be whether the recent repricing of UK assets reflects a changed assessment by markets of the UK macroeconomic policy mix between fiscal and monetary policy . The extent to which that can be determined will depend on whether markets settle at a new level, which itself will depend in part on getting a clearer picture on fiscal policy and the fiscal outlook. What does all this add up to in terms of the overall impact on the economy and on inflation. An obvious starting point might be to look at the evolution of our forecasts over the last year in response to the four shocks I've highlighted and other developments. The picture you get is of successive upwards revisions to inflation and successive downwards revisions to growth, with the energy price shock the principal driver of both . By the time of the August 2022 MPR, the MPC was forecasting a recession starting in the current quarter and lasting throughout 2023, with a peak to trough fall of GDP of 2.1%. But because the fiscal and financial markets shocks post-date the most recent forecast it wouldn't make sense to extrapolate this trend of forecast revisions forward as a starting point for our November forecasts. In the August MPR we had already noted that that the risks around our projections from both external and domestic factors were exceptionally large, given the very large rise in wholesale gas prices and the consequent impacts on real incomes for households and on inflation. The MPC's initial assessment of the Energy Price Guarantee, first made at the time of the September MPC, is that it will significantly reduce the degree of uncertainty around the outlook for UK retail energy prices over the period of the Guarantee and therefore also for CPI inflation. As a result the Guarantee means that CPI inflation is expected to rise by less in the near term, peaking at a little under 11% in October, lowering and bringing forward the expected peak in inflation, relative to the MPC's August forecast. For the duration of the Guarantee this should reduce the risk that a long period of externally generated inflation leads to more persistent domestic price and wage pressures, although the MPC agreed that risk remained material. At the September MPC we also noted further signs of continuing strength of domestically generated inflation, that the labour market remains tight and domestic costs and price pressures including from businesses are elevated. Against that backdrop our initial assessment of the demand impact of the Energy Price Guarantee was that household spending was likely to be less weak than projected in the August report over the first two years of the forecast, and all else equal, relative to that forecast, it would add to inflationary pressures in the medium term. Since summer 2021, I've been highlighting my concerns about the build-up of inflationary risks . A key consideration in my assessment of the risks that above target inflation persists is what happens to inflation expectations. I have already described how short term inflation expectations may be impacting on the immediate outlook for earnings. These could in turn feed through into prices given the high share of wages in costs, particularly in the services sector. And the same could happen if the current inflationary environment companies attempt to protect or increase their margins. Because shorter term measures of inflation expectations tend to move with actual inflation policymakers tend to focus on longer term measures. For households, there have been mixed signals from recent surveys, although in most cases their level had also remained elevated relative to historical averages. For instance, the Citi/YouGov indicator of household expectations of inflation in five to ten-years' time has risen, but the Bank's Inflation Attitudes Survey for expectations of inflation in five years has fallen back from earlier on in the year. For businesses, data from the Bank's Decision Maker Panel survey for September was published yesterday and it showed that firms' expectations for inflation three years ahead had risen further to 4.8 per cent, from 4.2 per cent in August . A market-based measure of longer term inflation expectations I have put particular emphasis on is the two-year swap rate for inflation, five years ahead. This was because it was on a sustained upwards trend through 2021 and peaked at 4.7% in March 2022. I took some encouragement from its subsequent fall back into the early summer but it picked up again through August. It has been caught up in the wider market turbulence and in the often illiquid markets of the last fortnight it has been very volatile from day to day. This makes it impossible to get a clean read of the recent trend, but in level terms it still remains well above its longer term average, more so than is the case for the Euro area, whereas the equivalent measure for the US remains around its longer term average . Let me conclude by setting out how in response to these developments the MPC is setting monetary policy to ensure that CPI inflation will return to the 2% target in the medium term. Monetary policy is also acting to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations are anchored at the 2% target. The MPC started to tighten monetary policy in December 2021, raising Bank rate from 0.1% to 0.25%. So much has happened since but it is worth recalling that last December was less than three months after the end of the furlough scheme here in the UK and was when the rapid emergence of the Omicron variant was a major concern. It was also three months before the Fed started to tighten policy in the US and almost seven months before the ECB began the tightening cycle in the euro area. Bank rate has been increased at every MPC meeting since December 2021 and was increased by 0.5% at both the August and September meetings, to its current level of 2.25% . Along with two of my MPC colleagues I voted for a larger 0.75% increase in Bank Rate, to 2.5% at the September 2022 meeting. At the time the three of us highlighted that the recent data outturns had already registered more persistent inflationary pressures and that medium-term measures of inflation expectations remained high. We welcomed the reduction of the near-term peak in inflation which will result from the Energy Price Guarantee but noted that the additional support it is providing to households will add to demand pressure. My September vote was informed by three particular aspects of what I've set out for you today. First the greater certainty we have about household spending, because of the greater support to demand being provided by the Energy Price Guarantee. Second the trends I've observed in domestically generated inflation, including in labour costs, in firms' pricing and in the broadening out in inflationary pressures with services price inflation now contributing more to overall CPI inflation. And third, higher medium-term inflation expectations and the risk that a more inflationary mentality takes hold throughout the economy. In my view a faster policy tightening at the last MPC meeting would have helped to bring inflation back to the 2% target sustainably in the medium term and would reduce the risks of a more extended and costly tightening later. Our November decision and latest forecasts will be published in just under four weeks time. In the intervening period we will be seeking answers to a range of questions to inform our assessment of how quickly inflation will return to target in the medium term. For me questions include: is there any evidence that the tight labour market is easing; what is the revised outlook for demand in view of the Government's fiscal announcements; are domestically generated inflation pressures consistent with returning inflation to the 2 per cent target; and what do financial market developments tell us. The MPC was clear in its language in September that should the outlook suggest more persistent inflationary pressures, including from stronger demand, the Committee would respond forcefully as necessary. In the context of the developments I've set out for you, today I think the central question for all nine of us on the MPC is how forceful do we need to be, to ensure inflation does return sustainably to the 2% target in the medium term. These are very challenging times for the UK economy and millions of households and businesses are experiencing real hardship as a result of the cost of living crisis. On the MPC we are acutely conscious that for many our monetary policy actions are adding to the difficulties caused by the current situation. We know from past periods in our history the damage to households and businesses that would result if high inflation persisted. Unlike earlier inflationary episodes, where we saw more persistence in inflation caused by ineffective policy and policy frameworks, this time we have a monetary policy framework which empowers us to take action. However difficult the consequences might be for the economy, the MPC must stay the course and set monetary policy to return inflation to achieve the 2% target sustainably in the medium term, consistent with the remit given to us. There is a huge literature on techniques for and applications of the identification of shocks. Different categorisations have been used for a variety of policy purposes. For example whether shocks are common or idiosyncratic was a key consideration for HM Treasury's 2003 Five Tests assessment of whether the UK should join the Euro. Other common categorisations include are they exogenous or endogenous, are they temporary or permanent and are they positive or negative. I am grateful to my MPC colleague Jonathan Haskel for this international comparison. The latest of a series of puzzles about the structural behaviour of the UK economy. The most well-known is the productivity puzzle which has spawned a huge literature including my own contribution, see .

7684,r221010a_FOMC,united states,2022-10-10,Restoring Price Stability in an Uncertain Economic Environment,brainard,0,"It is a pleasure to join this discussion today. Inflation is high in the United States and around the world reflecting the lingering imbalance between robust demand and constrained supply caused by the pandemic and Russia's war against Ukraine. Global supply chains have eased significantly, but by some measures they are still more constrained than at nearly any time since the late 1990s. High inflation places a burden on all Americans, but especially lower-income families, who spend three-fourths of their income on necessities--more than twice the share spent by higher-income families. The Federal Reserve has tightened policy strongly to bring inflation down, and U.S. tightening is being amplified by concurrent foreign tightening. We are starting to see the effects in some areas, but it will take some time for the cumulative tightening to transmit throughout the economy and to bring inflation down. Uncertainty remains high, and I am paying close attention to the evolution of the outlook as well as global risks. Higher interest rates are working to temper demand and bring it into better alignment with supply, which is still constrained. Output has decelerated so far this year by more than anticipated, suggesting that policy tightening is having some effect. Real gross domestic product (GDP) declined at an annual rate of roughly 1 percent in the first half. Real private domestic final purchases stepped down from a 6.4 percent pace last year to an annual rate of only 1.3 percent during the first half of this year. Recent revisions to national income and product accounts data imply that the current stock of excess savings held by households is lower and has been drawn down  more rapidly in recent quarters than had been previously estimated. Indeed, by Board staff estimates, the revisions imply that the stock of excess savings held by households is about 25 percent lower, which may imply a more subdued pace of consumer spending going forward than had been projected. Market expectations for the level of the policy rate at the end of the year are now more than twice as high as they were just seven months ago. As a result of the significant increase in interest rates and associated tightening in broader financial conditions, I now expect that the second-half rebound will be limited, and that real GDP growth will be essentially flat this year. The moderation in demand due to monetary policy tightening is only partly realized so far. The transmission of tighter policy is most evident in highly interest- sensitive sectors like housing, where mortgage rates have more than doubled year to date and house price appreciation has fallen sharply over recent months and is on track to soon be flat. In other sectors, lags in transmission mean that policy actions to date will have their full effect on activity in coming quarters, and the effect on price setting may take longer. The moderation in demand should be reinforced by the concurrent rapid global tightening of monetary policy. Against the backdrop of slower output growth, we are seeing some tentative signs of rebalancing in the labor market. Anecdotal reports suggest the availability and  retention of workers are improving. For the second month in a row, growth in monthly payroll employment stepped down, slowing from 315,0000 in August to 263,000 in September. There was a sharp 1.1 million decline in job openings from July to August in seekers declined to 1.7; for purposes of comparison, this ratio was 1.2 prior to the pandemic. The sharp fall in vacancies at a time when initial claims held steady at low levels provides support for the possibility that businesses that faced significant challenges finding and retaining qualified workers following the pandemic may be more inclined than in past cycles to retain rather than lay off their workers as demand weakens. In particular, there is still a sizable 1.2 million shortfall in employment levels relative to pre- pandemic levels in the in-person services sectors that accounted for the majority of September payroll gains, suggesting businesses in those sectors may still be trying to narrow that gap. That said, a variety of indicators suggest labor demand remains strong, while labor supply remains below pre-pandemic conditions. The unemployment rate is now at the very low level that prevailed pre-pandemic, and the volume of quits remains  elevated. This supply-demand imbalance in the labor market is reflected in strong wage growth. The employment cost index increased by an annual rate of 6.3 percent over the second quarter--its highest level in decades. A more-timely data source, average hourly earnings, decelerated slightly to a 4.4 percent annual rate over the third quarter, down from 4.6 percent annual growth in the second quarter. Although it is well above levels consistent with 2 percent inflation, wage growth has been running below current inflation. Strong wage growth along with high rental and housing costs mean that inflation from core services is expected to ease only slowly from currently elevated levels. In contrast, core goods have been expected to return to something closer to the pre- pandemic trend of modest disinflation as a result of demand rotation away from goods to services, coupled with the healing of supply chains and declining core import prices. Disinflation in core goods would help to offset the inflationary pressures in services. During the five years before the crisis, core goods made a small negative contribution to inflation. The contribution of core goods to inflation swung sharply into positive territory in 2021, and had started to step down somewhat in the middle part of 2022. So the surprise in the August inflation data was the large contribution of core goods inflation to overall inflation at a point in the post-pandemic recovery when many forecasts anticipated this contribution would continue moderating.  Since the pandemic, significant supply and demand imbalances have coincided with large increases in retail trade margins in several sectors. In some sectors, the increase in the retail trade margin exceeds the contemporaneous increase in wages paid to the workers engaged in retail trade, although this is not true in food and apparel. The return of retail margins to more normal levels could meaningfully help reduce inflationary pressures in some consumer goods, considering that gross retail margins are about 30 percent of total sales dollars overall. For instance, among general merchandise retailers, where the real inventory-to- sales ratio is 20 percent above its pre-pandemic level, retail margins have increased 20 percent since the onset of the pandemic, roughly double the 9 percent increase in average hourly earnings by employees in that sector. In the auto sector, where the real inventory-to-sales ratio is 20 percent below its pre-pandemic level, the retail margin for motor vehicles sold at dealerships has increased by more than 180 percent since February 2020, 10 times the rise in average hourly earnings within that sector. So there is ample room for margin recompression to help reduce goods inflation as demand cools, supply constraints ease, and inventories increase. Despite the higher prices for a broad set of goods and services, market- and survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are within ranges consistent with expectations that inflation will return to 2 percent over the medium term.  Inflation-Protected Securities-based measures of five-year, five-year-forward breakeven inflation compensation are currently at 2.15 percent, roughly 10 basis points below their level at the start of the year. The median of inflation expectations over the next 5 to 10 years in the Michigan survey ticked down in September to 2.7 percent, below the 2.9 to 3.1 percent range in which it had been fluctuating since July 2021 and back within the range that was common before the 2015 decline in this metric. Currently, there is a greater dispersion than usual of views about future inflation in survey responses. Previously this reflected a rise in expectations for significantly above-target inflation, but now that dispersion also reflects expectations on the part of one quarter of respondents that prices are likely be the same or below their current level 5 to 10 years in the future. In order to bring inflation down and to keep inflation expectations solidly anchored at 2 percent, the Federal Reserve has increased the federal funds rate target range by 300 basis points in the past seven months, and both market and policymaker surveys indicate additional increases through the end of this year and into next year. In addition, balance sheet shrinkage is now proceeding at its maximum rate, reinforcing the move to a restrictive stance. Broader U.S. financial conditions have tightened rapidly in response: The two-year Treasury yield has moved above 4 percent for the first time since 2007, and the 10-year yield is near its highest level in over a decade at 3.9 percent. Corporate bond yields have risen even more, as investment- and speculative-grade corporate bond spreads have increased about 80 basis points and 170 basis points,  respectively, over the year. Mortgage rates have more than doubled since the beginning of the year. The Board's broad dollar index has appreciated 11 percent year to date. Monetary policy tightening is also proceeding rapidly abroad. Many central banks in large economies have raised rates by 125 basis points or more in the past six months, and yields on 10-year sovereign debt in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the largest euro area economies have seen increases on the order of 190 to 360 basis points this year. The combined effect of concurrent global tightening is larger than the sum of its parts. The Federal Reserve takes into account the spillovers of higher interest rates, a stronger dollar, and weaker demand from foreign economies into the United States, as well as in the reverse direction. We are attentive to the risk of further adverse shocks-- for instance, from Russia's war against Ukraine, the pandemic, or China's zero-COVID policies. And we are also very aware that the cross-border effects of unexpected movements in interest rates and exchange rates, as well as worsening external imbalances, in some cases could interact with financial vulnerabilities. In this environment, a sharp decrease in risk sentiment or other risk event that may be difficult to anticipate could be amplified, especially given fragile liquidity in core financial markets. In some countries, the realization of these risks could pose challenging tradeoffs for policy.  That said, the real yield curve is now in solidly positive territory at all but the very shortest maturities, and the entire real curve will soon move into positive territory with the additional tightening and deceleration in inflation that are expected over coming quarters. Monetary policy will be restrictive for some time to ensure that inflation moves back to target over time. It will take time for the cumulative effect of tighter monetary policy to work through the economy broadly and to bring inflation down. In light of elevated global economic and financial uncertainty, moving forward deliberately and in a data-dependent manner will enable us to learn how economic activity, employment, and inflation are adjusting to cumulative tightening in order to inform our assessments of the path of the policy rate.","['inflation', 'inflationary', 'tightening', 'fluctuating', 'monetary']","['inflation tightening', 'tightening monetary', 'global tightening', 'current inflation', 'inflation adjusting']","['bring inflation tightening', 'monetary policy tightening', 'global tightening monetary', 'tightening monetary policy', 'tightening deceleration inflation']","['monetary policy tightening', 'tighter monetary policy', 'current inflation', 'inflationary pressures', 'policy tightening']"
3242,r221011a_ECB,euro area,2022-10-11,The transmission of monetary policy,lane,0,"In our September monetary policy meeting, the ECB's Governing Council communicated that, over the next several meetings, we intend to raise our key policy rates towards levels that will ensure the timely return of inflation to our two per cent medium-term target. In identifying the appropriate levels for the key policy rates, a range of factors must be considered. First, an assessment of the medium-term outlook for inflation is required: the quarterly staff macroeconomic projection exercises provide important foundations, while each meeting also draws on wide-ranging overviews of the latest economic, financial and market developments in order to develop an assessment of both the most-likely medium-term inflation path and the balance of risks around that path. Second, this assessment forms the basis for calculating the monetary policy path that is required to eliminate in a timely manner the gap between the projected inflation rate (that would be expected to materialise if monetary policy were not modified) and the two percent inflation target, while also narrowing the distribution of inflation risks around the most-likely path. This calibration stage crucially relies on a quantitative analysis of the various stages in the monetary policy transmission mechanism. Working backwards, monetary policy can be viewed as affecting inflation through two main channels: (a) reducing inflationary pressure by increasing economic slack (lowering aggregate demand relative to the supply capacity of the economy); and (b) ensuring that medium-term inflation expectations are anchored at the two per cent target. The first channel can be de-composed into several links: (i) the link between our monetary policy instruments - our policy rates, our balance sheet policies and our communication policy (including any forward guidance) - and financial conditions; (ii) the link between financial conditions and economic slack; and (iii) the link between economic slack and inflation pressures. The second channel can be broken down into a further two elements: (iv) if inflation expectations are broadly anchored, the monetary policy needed to ensure expectations remain anchored; and (v) if inflation expectations are de-anchored (or at serious risk of being de-anchored), the monetary policy needed to ensure inflation expectations are re-anchored. In what follows, I will discuss some of the challenges in forming quantitative assessments of the strength of these various mechanisms. First, I will discuss the various mechanisms by which monetary policy operates. Second, I will assess how the considerable shift in monetary policy during this year is being transmitted. However, from the outset, it is essential to make three basic points. First, monetary policy is always decided under conditions of uncertainty: not only uncertainty about inflation dynamics but also uncertainty about each of the channels connecting medium-term inflation to our monetary policy instruments. This uncertainty is mitigated to some extent by taking a meeting-by-meeting approach to calibrating monetary policy, such that the latest information can be incorporated (including updates on the strength of the transmission mechanism). Second, the considerable lags between monetary policy actions and their impact on inflation outcomes also imply that much of the near-term attention in assessing monetary policy actions focuses on the transmission to financial conditions (and, where feasible, inflation expectations). Assessing the ultimate impact on inflation dynamics, meanwhile, must rely on analytical tools that seek to draw on the historical evidence in the most informative way, recognising the relevant differences across previous inflation episodes. Third, in the absence of further shocks, the profile of euro area inflation over the next 12 to 18 months will be primarily driven by the fading impact of past supply shocks and the deceleration in demand that is signalled by the latest confidence indicators: the role of monetary policy is to ensure that the ""residual"" inflation dynamic returns to target in a timely manner. Let me start by outlining the main transmission channels of monetary policy. Conceptually, the monetary policy transmission process can be divided into upstream stages of transmission and downstream effects. The upstream stages include our steering of the short-term money market conditions and how these propagate to the risk-free and sovereign yield curves (mainly through expectations of the future path of policy rates). The downstream effects are captured by the adjustments in the cost and volume of external finance available to the firms and households that are dependent on banks for access to credit. I will begin with the upstream stages of the transmission mechanism and then turn to the downstream effects. Monetary policy works through its influence on the entire yield curve. Changes in the policy rates directly affect only very short-term money-market interest rates. But the expectations of future policy rates are a primary determinant of medium and long-term interest rates, together with term premia. It is the adjustment in term interest rates along the risk-free and sovereign curve that matters most for the economy, as these directly affect the conditions under which firms, banks and governments can borrow in financial markets and indirectly affect the cost of borrowing of firms and households to the extent that they rely on bank borrowing, since banks price their loans off the risk-free or sovereign yield curve. In addition to the rate expectations mechanism, our securities holdings are still bearing down on long-term interest rates through what is known as the duration extraction effect. Duration risk exposure is costly for private investors, as they need to set aside capital and balance sheet space to bear this type of exposure. This is why investors demand compensation in the form of higher expected returns when locking in long-dated fixed-income investments, which in turn translates into higher term premia and long-term yields. In purchasing long-dated assets, a central bank takes duration risk off private hands, which translates into lower term premia and long-term interest rates. As the Eurosystem - in common with many other central banks - still holds a considerable portion of the universe of euro-denominated bonds, our holdings are still exerting downward pressure (albeit more weakly) on term premia and long-term yields. The extent to which a reduction of the central bank balance sheet operates in a fashion that is fully symmetric to the effects of expanding the balance sheet still awaits to be authoritatively settled, given the dearth of sufficient evidence on episodes of bond portfolio wind-downs. This being said, the available analysis finds that some of the channels that are found to have been important in explaining the transmission of quantitative easing - announcement and signalling effects - may be absent or much diminished if the size of the balance sheet is reduced along a much more gradual and predictable path than the discrete and often unexpected actions through which QE was conducted in the past. At the same time, some other channels, such as the duration channel or liquidity effects, will probably either operate symmetrically or will be magnified. Moreover, the degree of financial market distress during the expansionary and contractionary phase and, in particular in the euro area context, the complementarities between asset purchases, rate guidance and the negative interest rate policy are likely to be relevant factors. Overall, a tentative conclusion about the impact of balance sheet actions on financial conditions in a normalisation phase is that the signalling channel will be weaker for a given adjustment to the size and composition of our balance sheet than it was in a phase when our asset purchase programmes resulted in a rapid increase in our securities holdings during a relatively short period. However, the signalling effects emanating from a given rate adjustment may well be larger than it is estimated to have been the case prior to the financial crisis. First, the exit from the negative interest rate policy may have strengthened the transmission of a rate hike throughout the term structure of interest rates. This would be the case if the unwinding of the outsized downward pressure on long-term yields that is estimated to have been associated with rate cuts in the negative territory was symmetric. Second, the retirement of rate forward guidance after years in which forward indications about the likely future path of interest rates had suppressed rate volatility almost entirely may invite markets to react to a rate increase by pulling back more sharply from longer-term securities as dealers and other providers of trading liquidity are less willing to put capital at risk to make two-sided markets in a context of perceived higher interest rate uncertainty. This may exert greater upward pressure on term premia and the level of long-term yields. The risk of snap-back in term premia and the sudden repricing of rate expectations warrant close monitoring from a market functioning and broader financial stability perspective. Interest rate changes affect households and firms through several channels. First, via the intertemporal substitution channel, higher interest rates provide incentives to households to save more now and postpone consumption from the present to the future. Second, all else being equal, higher interest rates lower asset prices (bond values, equity values and property values), with the resulting decrease in wealth discouraging spending through the wealth channel and reducing the scope to pledge collateral in debt transactions. The role of equity markets is particularly important for firms with higher growth opportunities, whose risk profile is typically more suited to market financing instruments with the possibility of risk-sharing (including private equity or ""alternative investment"" funds) rather than conventional bank debt. Recent studies suggest that there is a financing gap in Europe for potential growth companies relative to other economies, which significant drops in equity valuations would tend to aggravate. In parallel, the relevance of asset prices may have increased for households, following the significant growth in house prices. Moreover, after a large fall of their investment in financial markets following the Lehman crisis, the share of equity holdings in the aggregate financial wealth of households has been increasing. Third, the cash-flow channel operates through the impact of higher interest rates on the income and expenses of households and firms. Across households and firms, the size and sign of cash flow effects depend on whether these are in net borrowing or net saving positions, the relative exposure to variable rate versus fixed rate debt ( ), and the degree to which financial constraints are binding. In one direction, higher interest rates raise interest payments by indebted households and corporates, which reduces the cash flow available for spending. A similar effect applies to the interest expenses of the fiscal authority, which may crowd out primary spending to the extent that governments react to an increase in borrowing costs by compressing discretionary outlays. In the other direction, higher interest rates increase the interest revenues on the interest-bearing assets held by households and firms. Changes in interest rates also directly affect the liquidity and balance sheet strength of firms, which may adjust their investment spending in response, especially if these are financially constrained. Whereas variable-rate debt reflects changing interest rates almost immediately, fixed-rate debt does so only over time. While at the euro area level around 70 per cent of outstanding loans to households are at a fixed interest rate, this share is as high as around 90 per cent in France and Germany and as low as 25 per cent in Spain and Italy. This in turn points to relevant differences in the speed at which interest rate changes are passed through to households and firms. Chart 1: Share of fixed-rate loans for households and firms in the euro area (percentages, based on amounts outstanding) In the euro area's bank-centred economy, the bank lending channel plays an important role. It covers the transmission through banks to a larger share of firms, also including smaller firms which do not issue bonds, as well as to households. Bank funding costs are the first important element in the bank lending transmission channel. For about half of banking-sector liabilities, corresponding to debt securities and wholesale deposits, the remuneration is closely linked to market rates and therefore passed through quickly to the marginal funding costs of banks. By contrast, retail deposit rates adjust more sluggishly, keeping the rise in bank funding costs contained in a period of interest rate increases. In addition, TLTROs allowed for a compression in the intermediation wedge - the difference between the cost of loans and the risk-free interest rate. TLTRO therefore operated primarily via the bank lending channel - by providing funding certainty at attractive rates, which lowered the cost of loans for households and firms - rather than via risk free rates. At the same time, in the absence of new operations, TLTROs no longer have a direct accommodative contribution to the marginal funding costs of banks. The increase in market rates is transmitted via bank funding costs to bank lending rates on new loans (the interest rate channel) as well as via repricing of the existing stock of flexible-rate debt. In relation to the former, banks apply a markup on top of their funding cost, depending on borrower risk characteristics. In addition, increasing interest rates, typically associated with a decline in asset prices, may lower the value of collateral and hence determine an increase in lending rates over and beyond that associated with higher base rates and thereby impede access to bank loans. Furthermore, tight monetary policy drains reserves from the banking system, limiting the ability of banks to supply credit. As a result of the several steps in the transmission of monetary policy via the banking system, the pass-through of monetary policy to lending rates on new loans is slower than to market-based debt ( ). Using historical regularities (excluding the COVID period due to its exceptional character), a commonly used measure looks at the percentage of changes in market rates which translates over time into changes in lending rates on new loans (i.e. the so-called pass-through). Looking at pass-through measures, the repricing of corporate debt securities is much faster than the repricing of bank loans. In particular, a change in market rates is fully transmitted to a corresponding change in corporate bond yields within the same quarter (the pass-through rate is about one), while for lending rates it usually takes about six months to one year until changes in market rates are passed through to corporate bank lending rates. Chart 2: Pass-through of changes in market rates to lending and debt securities rates over time In addition to the transmission via lending rates, monetary policy is also transmitted to borrowers by banks adjusting their credit standards. Data on bank lending standards are collected directly from the banks in the euro area bank lending survey and monitored carefully to obtain early signals on future loan growth developments. An extended period of historically low interest rates in the aftermath of the financial crisis has fostered research on whether economic agents, in those conditions, might be encouraged to take on more risk and search for investment assets and strategies that generate higher investment returns. Importantly, banks and other investors may also be subject to excessive tolerance of risk in a low-return environment. These may not adequately adjust their expectations about future interest rates, assuming instead that rates will remain low for an extended period. This, in turn, may encourage banks to expand their balance sheets through leverage and originate an excessive amount of lower-quality credit because of softened lending standards. The build-up of financial imbalances associated with the over-expansion of the balance sheets of banks and other financial intermediaries makes them vulnerable to a pivot in monetary policy, leading in the most extreme case to a rapid unwinding of those positions as investors become risk averse. This can lead to an amplified effect of a firming in the monetary policy stance through generalised conditions of reduced liquidity and forced asset sales. Finally, interest rate and balance sheet policies also operate through an exchange rate channel. The uncovered interest rate parity (UIP) suggests that an upward shift in the risk-adjusted forward rate curve brings about an appreciation of the euro. Simple correlations between the exchange rate and interest rate expectations suggest that this relation has held up reasonably well historically and more recently in terms of the euro-US dollar bilateral exchange rate as well as in the cross-section of the effective exchange rates of major currencies. ECB model-based decompositions of financial asset price movements across the United States and the euro area point to a prominent role of US monetary policy tightening in driving the increase in euro area yields, the correction in euro area equity markets, and the recent euro depreciation. In fact, US monetary policy spillovers have had at least as much of an impact on euro area asset prices and the euro-dollar exchange rate over the last 12 months as ECB monetary policy actions. At the same time, while both rate normalisation and balance sheet normalisation in the euro area, all other things being equal, can be expected to exert appreciation pressure on the euro exchange rate, rate policies exert a stronger exchange rate effect than balance sheet policies. The deeply integrated nature of the global economy implies that our analysis needs to incorporate international monetary policy spillovers. For instance, changes in the interest rate locally affects domestic consumption and investment, which in turn affects the demand for imports from trading partners, and hence output abroad (""demand channel""). Via the financial channel, changes in the interest rates of major central banks can propagate across borders via asset price spillovers to bond yields, corporate earnings expectations and financial risk premia. Since the bulk of cross-border capital flows are denominated in US dollar, as the US dollar plays a dominant role, and as US monetary policy is a key driver of the global financial cycle, US interest rate changes have more pronounced repercussions on the rest of the world, including the euro area. This is also reflected in ECB staff analysis, which indicates that a Fed tightening elicits large contractionary effects on real activity and eventually inflation in the euro area. These contractionary effects are, in fact, as large as the domestic effects in the United States. Overall, given the open nature of the euro area economy, cross-border channels are crucial in evaluating how our policy stance transmits to the euro area, while also influencing global economic and financial conditions. A distinct feature of monetary policy in a monetary union is that it might entail differences in transmission across countries or regions, reflecting differences in the financial structure or other country-specific factors. For example, as noted above, the speed at which interest rate changes are passed through to households and firms might differ across euro area countries due to differences in the share of variable-rate loans. In addition, recent analysis by ECB staff suggests that the extent of international risk sharing plays a key role in shaping the real effects of monetary policy shocks in euro area regions. In particular, a monetary policy tightening is associated with a stronger output contraction, the lower is the degree of risk sharing in a region. Moreover, regions with a higher degree of risk sharing are less prone to persistent economic effects of interest rate changes ( ): while output in regions with minimum risk sharing remains around 1.5 percentage points below its initial level five years after a monetary policy tightening shock, it fully recovers over this period in regions with maximum risk sharing. Chart 3: Impact of monetary policy on regional output when risk sharing is high or low Notes: The chart shows the impact of a 100 basis point policy rate hike on regional output for low (blue) and high (red) levels of total risk sharing for a sample consisting of 155 regions from ten euro area countries over the period 2000-18 at an annual frequency. The x-axis refers to the horizon in years of the output response. The effect of the monetary policy shock is estimated with local linear projections. It is an essential task for monetary policy to ensure that medium-term inflation expectations are anchored at the two per cent target. The scale and speed of the rise in inflation since the middle of 2021 constitutes a major shock and has created an environment in which there is more intense questioning of the future inflation path. The longer and larger the deviation from the two percent target, the greater the risk that medium-term inflation expectations become de-anchored. All else equal, the monetary policy that stabilises inflation at target in a timely manner is also the monetary policy that stabilises expectations at target. First, by ensuring that the monetary policy stance will sufficiently dampen demand to return inflation to the target in a timely manner, price setters and wage setters are on notice that demand conditions will not sustain excessive price increases and wage increases. Second, clear communication of the effectiveness of our monetary policy measures and of our determination to adjust monetary policy in response to the evolving inflation outlook also helps households, firms, experts and markets to cut through the noise in the current highly uncertain environment and thereby helps to maintain the anchor for inflation expectations. So far, I have listed a range of channels by which monetary policy transmits to the financial system, the economy and, ultimately, inflation dynamics. In order to provide an integrated macroeconomic assessment, I will now turn to a discussion of model-based quantification of the overall impact of interest rate policy. Monetary policy transmission to the real economy typically entails considerable lags. It takes a sequence of reactions for the change in financing conditions to fully feed through to demand, and from demand to inflation. ECB model-based staff analysis suggests that, on average, the impact on inflation of a 100 basis point policy rate shock builds up gradually over time to reach its peak impact during the second year following the initial shock ( ). Across models, the time interval tends to be the shorter, the more forward-looking are agents, as the adjustment in demand becomes more frontloaded. This corresponds to the hypothetical case of an isolated and temporary change in the policy rate, and the macroeconomic impact associated with the on-going normalisation - which includes a sequence of persistent changes in interest rates that extend into expectations for the future - is likely to be larger and more persistent than suggested by these standard model responses. At the same time, drawing on these estimates certainly implies that monetary policy cannot bring inflation back to target in the short run. In this respect, our medium-term orientation acknowledges this lag and allows to also account for uncertainties in the inflation process and the transmission mechanism. The impact of monetary policy on real output at the aggregate level conceals some differences across sectors and industries. In particular, consumer demand for housing and durable goods is traditionally more sensitive to interest rate changes and therefore tends to be more responsive to monetary policy. More broadly, differences in monetary policy transmission across sectors can be related to differences in financial structure, in particular the maturity structure of debt, the coverage ratio, financial leverage and firm size. Coming to the assessment of the macroeconomic impact of normalisation, ECB staff estimates, based on a suite of macroeconomic models regularly used for policy analysis at the ECB, indicate that the change in the short-to-medium term structure of interest rates and balance sheet expectations since December 2021 is expected to compress inflation by more than one percentage point in 2024. At the same time, the ECB's Governing Council is fully aware that further ground needs to be covered in the next several meetings to exit from the prevailing highly accommodative level of policy rates. It should also be clear that any quantitative estimates are surrounded by significant uncertainty. One dimension of this uncertainty is captured by the range of estimates across models. In particular, the impact tends to be larger in those models that embed a more elaborated financial block that supports real-financial amplification effects and models that feature stronger expectation and confidence channels as entailed in DSGE-type models. In addition, models that can better account for the conditional correlations between identified monetary policy impulses and macroeconomic aggregates, as opposed to more reduced-form models, tend to exhibit a stronger impact of monetary policy. Such uncertainty motivates the ECB's staff choice to use a suite of models that spans different modelling classes, ranging from fully structural dynamic general equilibrium models to semi-structural models. This notwithstanding, in the current situation of exceptionally high inflation, uncertainty has significantly increased beyond the historically regularities captured by the available models. Finally, these estimates do not capture the benefit of preventing adverse non-linear dynamics that could materialise in the absence of policy decisions, which could risk destabilising inflation expectations down the road. Accounting for these non-linear dynamics is challenging but would likely point to a larger impact of monetary policy than captured here. Chart 4: Response to a standard monetary policy shock: comparison across models (deviation from baseline in percentage points) Notes: This chart depicts the impulse responses of real output and inflation to a standard short-term interest rate shock (normalised to 100 basis points) for the ECB-BASE model, the ECB New Area Wide Model (NAWM) and the MMR model. Real output refers to the output gap as a percentage of GDP. Inflation is in year-on-year percentage change. All responses refer to deviation from the baseline in percentage points. Structural features imply differences in transmission of monetary policy both across countries and over time. Some euro area financial structures may currently dampen the impact of monetary policy in the euro area compared to the past (typically those features relate to interest rate fixation in private borrowing), while others (first and foremost the disruptions in energy supply) may act as amplifiers. While high inflation certainly reflects global factors related to the rise in energy costs and supply bottlenecks, each central bank faces structures which are unique to their jurisdictions and influence the transmission of monetary policy. Chart 5: Ratio between bonds and loans for firms in the euro area versus United States (ratio of outstanding amounts) Note: The latest observation is for the second quarter of 2022. As a more bank-based system, the euro area might entail a more delayed reaction through the interest rate channel, as compared to countries where firms finance themselves predominantly with market-based debt ( ). This is due to the slower speed of pass-through of market rate changes into lending rates on new loans compared with corporate bond yields. As already hinted previously, firms in the euro area rely predominantly on banks for their external financing compared to the United States. This implies that the same policy actions might take more time in the euro area to be transmitted to the average firm in the economy Over the last decade, larger euro area firms have increased recourse to market-based finance. This may slightly accelerate the pass-through of monetary policy, even if pass-through in the US remains faster by comparison. Central banks take such lags into account when setting their policy action and monitor carefully the pass-through via financial markets and the banking system. Another factor behind current differences in transmission is that European firms are more affected than firms in other jurisdictions by disruptions in energy supply ( ). In particular, higher exposures to energy imports from Russia imply higher upward pressure on prices via higher commodity prices. It may also entail higher borrower risk and thus banks applying higher lending rates to firms, compared to a no-war counterfactual. These higher lending rates would negatively affect investments and aggregate demand, thus exerting downward pressure on domestic inflation. (percentage of total imports in 2019) Notes: Products considered are crude petroleum (2709), refined petroleum (2710), petroleum gas (2711) and coal (2701). Latest observation is for 2019. Turning to households, on the one hand, their indebtedness is generally lower in the euro area than in the United States. This implies a weaker response of consumption to monetary policy in the euro area ( ). This was even more the case before the Great Financial Crisis, after which US households deleveraged to a great extent. Euro area household debt stands at overall moderate levels, somewhat above the level at the start of the pandemic in 2019, but considerably lower than for US households. The low interest rate environment in recent years has meant a considerable reduction in the interest payments made by households. Looking ahead, due to higher interest rates, gross interest payments in the euro area can be expected to rise by only a limited extent, in view of relatively contained household debt levels and the extent of fixed-rate contracts. However, compared to the US, this increase in interest payments may happen more quickly, in view of the importance of variable-rate mortgages in some parts of the euro area. Furthermore, estimates of so called 'wealthy-hand-to-mouth' (i.e. households with significant illiquid wealth, limited liquid wealth and elevated debt) are consistently lower than in the US. Recent research indicates that a lower share of such households also translates into a lower marginal propensity to consume by households and thus a weaker transmission mechanism. The latest observation is for the first quarter of 2022. Another factor to consider in relation to the transmission of our monetary policy is the causal relation between economy-wide slack and inflation as captured by the structural Phillips Curve. A swathe of empirical evidence indicates that the structural connection between inflation and unemployment remains present both in the euro area and the US but evolves over time. In addition, while developments in economic slack can account for a significant share of inflation, it cannot fully explain inflation developments in more recent years due to the growing importance of factors beyond the business cycle. Looking to the future, this evidence overall suggests that further progress in bringing inflation towards our aim can be attained by ensuring the appropriate level of slack in the economy, provided inflation expectations remain sufficiently well-anchored. Let me now turn to the evidence on how the adjustments in our monetary policy since last December have been transmitted. Starting with the money market, the transmission of the increase in the key ECB interest rates to the unsecured money market rates has been smooth and complete for both the July and September rate hikes ( This is especially important, since the EURSTR is the basis for the overnight interest rate swap curve, along which the market prices expectations of future policy. In the secured segment, the general pattern has been that of near-complete adjustment of repo rates for transactions based on a broad collateral pool, which are predominantly driven by a motivatio","['inflationary', 'inflation', 'macroeconomic', 'monetary', 'fiscal']","['projected inflation', 'inflation monetary', 'inflation target', 'inflation outlook', 'monetary policy']","['inflation monetary policy', 'stages monetary policy', 'assessing monetary policy', 'calibrating monetary policy', 'projected inflation rate']","['monetary policy measures', 'future inflation path', 'monetary policy path', 'term inflation path', 'inflation outlook']"
7685,r221012b_FOMC,united states,2022-10-12,Managing the Promise and Risk of Financial Innovation,barr,0,"Thank you, Chris, and thank you for the invitation to speak to you today about the opportunities and risks of innovation. For the purposes of our discussion today, I will be focusing on financial innovation supported by new technologies, or fintech. In the fall of 2017, we managed to get Chris to accept an invitation to speak at a fintech conference in Ann Arbor, so it's about time that I returned the favor. Since then, we have continued to see major changes in technologies and the financial services and products they support. In looking over the materials for that conference, however, I'm struck by how the key themes have remained constant over, not only the last five years, but arguably for centuries. Financial innovation has always brought promise and risk, and the urgent need to get regulation right. In 1610, when Dutch merchants and bankers were otherwise busy creating global finance, a series of destabilizing bank runs also moved them to establish a ban on short-selling. Many of the issues we grapple with today are not as new as we think. First, let's start with the promise. Every day, we all have countless interactions with the financial system--depositing our paychecks, buying groceries, paying rent, borrowing, saving, and insuring against important risks. The promise of fintech is that it can make financial products and services better, faster, cheaper, and more available. Financial innovation supported by new technologies can disrupt traditional providers by spurring competition, creating products that better meet customer needs, and extending the reach of financial services and products to those typically underserved.  To realize the benefits of innovation, we need to manage relevant risks. We have seen through history that excitement over innovative financial products can lead to a pace of adoption that overwhelms our ability to assess and manage underlying vulnerabilities. As we saw in the lead up to the Global Financial Crisis, innovative financial products can mask emerging risks, resulting in significant harms to businesses and households and ultimately undermining financial stability. These products can leave consumers vulnerable if they are not coupled with meaningful disclosures and basic protections against abusive practices. Innovation can lead to disruptions of existing markets, which may be beneficial, but may also generate new systemic risks. Guarding against these risks is one of the jobs of financial regulation and supervision, and I'll talk through a few examples of how we are working to do so now. But I would note with some humility that striking the right balance between creating an enabling environment that supports innovation and managing related risks to businesses, households, and the stability of the financial system is no easy task. When regulations are too prescriptive or regulators too cautious, they run the risk of stifling innovation and locking in the market power of dominant participants in ways that can raise costs and limit access. When regulation is lax or behind the curve, it can facilitate risk-taking and a race to the bottom that puts consumers, businesses, and the economy in danger and discredits new products and services with consumers and investors. I believe everyone has a stake in getting the regulatory balance right. Crypto-assets have grown rapidly in the last several years, both in market capitalization and in reach. But recent fissures in these markets have shown that some  crypto-assets are rife with risks, including fraud, theft, manipulation, and even exposure to money-laundering activities. Crypto-asset-related activity, both outside and inside supervised banks, requires oversight that includes safeguards to ensure that crypto service providers are subject to similar regulations as other financial services providers. We continue to work on this issue from the overriding principle that the same type of activity should be regulated in the same way. This principle holds even when the activity may look different from the typical activities we regulate, or when it involves an exciting new technology or a new way to provide traditional financial services. The Board is working with our colleagues at the Office of the Comptroller of the crypto-asset-related activities banks may become involved in are well regulated and supervised, to protect both customers and the financial system. Many of these activities pose novel risks, and it is important for banks to ensure that any crypto-asset-related activities they conduct are legally permissible and that banks have appropriate measures in place to manage those risks. In August, the Board issued supervisory guidance that outlines the steps Federal Reserve-supervised banks should take prior to engaging in crypto-asset-related activities. The recent volatility in crypto markets has demonstrated the extent of centralization and interconnectedness among crypto-asset companies, which contributes  to amplified stress. While banks were not directly exposed to losses from these events, these episodes have highlighted potential risks for banking organizations. When a bank's deposits are concentrated in deposits from the crypto-asset industry or from crypto-asset companies that are highly interconnected or share similar risk profiles, banks may experience deposit fluctuations that are correlated and closely linked to broader developments in crypto-asset markets. In addition, misrepresentations regarding deposit insurance by crypto-asset companies can cause customer confusion and lead to increased withdrawals at banks providing deposit services to crypto-asset firms and their customers during times of stress. The Fed is working with the OCC and the FDIC on these issues and highlighting them to supervised institutions. For example, it is important for banks to understand some of the heightened liquidity risks they may face from certain types of deposits from crypto-asset companies. This effort is not intended to discourage banks from providing access to banking products and services to businesses associated with crypto-assets. Our work in this area is focused on ensuring risks are appropriately managed. Looking ahead, there are additional types of crypto-asset-related activities where the Fed may need to provide guidance to the banking sector in the coming months and years. Because crypto-assets have proved to be so volatile, they are unlikely to grow into money substitutes and become a viable means to pay for transactions. However, stablecoins, which purport to maintain a stable value, have greater capacity to function as privately issued money. For this reason, they pose specific, and well-understood risks, similar to other types of money-like assets. History has shown that money-like assets are  subject to runs that can threaten financial stability. Stablecoins linked to the dollar are of particular interest to the Federal Reserve. As Chair Powell said the other day, a central bank is and will always be the main source of trust behind money. Stablecoins borrow that trust, so we have an abiding interest in a strong federal prudential framework for their use. Over time, stablecoins could pose a risk to financial stability, and it is important to get the regulatory framework right before they do. Here too, the Fed is working with other regulatory agencies. The President's Working Group report on stablecoins that came out about a year ago called upon Congress to take the necessary action to ensure that stablecoins, particularly those that serve as a means of payment, are subject to prudential regulation. Congress should take action to provide a strong federal framework for prudential oversight, and regulators must also use existing authorities. We are seeing banks explore a variety of different models to issue dollar- denominated tokens on distributed ledger networks. The proposals range from issuance of tokens on private, controlled networks to facilitate payments within or among banks, to proposals that explore issuance of freely circulating tokens on open, permissionless networks. As banks explore different options to tap into the potential of the technology, it is important to identify and assess the novel risks inherent in those models and whether those risks are surmountable. For instance, with some models that are being explored,  the bank may not be able to track who is holding its tokenized liability, or whether its token is being used in risky or illegal activity. While there is work underway on technical solutions for managing these risks, it remains an open question whether banks can engage in such arrangements in a manner consistent with safe and sound banking and in compliance with relevant law. Given these open questions, banks looking to experiment with these new technologies should do so only in a controlled and limited manner. As banks experiment, I invite them to engage with their regulators early and often to discuss the benefits and risks of new use cases, ensuring they are consistent with banking activities conducted in a safe, sound, and legally permissible manner. Let me mention an example of where I think regulators could play a more active role in shaping how innovation is changing the financial products landscape. Over the past decade, digitization of financial services has led to the creation of vast amounts of customer data. Advancement in technologies now facilitates greater connectivity and secure data sharing between banks and nonbanks. This has served as the foundation for open banking and the development of new types of financial products and services that offer consumers greater customization and an end-user experience with less friction, compared to traditional banking. Jurisdictions around the world have taken different approaches to open banking. Some, such as Australia, Britain, and the European Union have adopted a regulatory approach to facilitate open banking by implementing specific regulatory frameworks that are built upon the concepts of consumer data rights, data privacy, and competition. So far, the United States has taken more of a market-driven approach to open banking. The  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is charged with implementing regulations to give consumers access to their financial data, pursuant to Section 1033 of the Dodd-Frank Act. While this is not an ""open banking"" rule, it will set the stage for consumers to gain greater control when it comes to sharing their data with prospective providers. The goal of this effort is to advance consumer autonomy, enhance competition for financial services, and to provide easier portability of account information from bank to bank as well as nonbank providers. I look forward to hearing more on this from the CFPB. So let me now turn to how the Federal Reserve is taking proactive steps to work with the private sector to support innovation. The Federal Reserve has been working on modernizing our payment system for a few years now, and we are in the final stages of creating the FedNow Service, a new platform for digital payments that will safely, efficiently, and instantaneously move money. FedNow will improve safeguards on instant payments, making the financial system safer. And it will improve access to the financial system by reducing payment delays and the high costs associated with those delays. As I have discussed extensively in my writings and speeches, these costs are particularly borne by those least able to afford them. Banks and service providers will be able to build innovative financial products using FedNow's real-time, low cost, safe payment rails, benefiting households and businesses. We plan to launch FedNow between May and July next year. It will help to  lower costs, extend access, and improve security for consumers and safety for the financial system. No conversation about payments innovation is complete without mention of central bank digital currencies (CBDC). The Federal Reserve has not made any decisions about whether to issue a CBDC, and if we believe it makes sense to do so, we would want the support of Congress and the Administration. In the meantime, we're doing the work of understanding the technological requirements of such a system, deepening our understanding of potential policy tradeoffs, and taking a look at how other countries are thinking about and experimenting with CBDCs. Let me end where I began: We need to get the guardrails right to successfully support a dynamic marketplace of innovative financial products and services. We have a responsibility to ensure that regulation and supervision foster innovations that improve access to financial services, while at the same time safeguarding consumers, financial institutions, and financial stability.

7686,r221012a_FOMC,united states,2022-10-12,Forward Guidance as a Monetary Policy Tool: Considerations for the Current Economic Environment,bowman,0,"Thanks to the Money Marketeers for inviting me to share my perspective on the conduct of monetary policy in the current environment of unacceptably high inflation. It is a pleasure to be here with you this evening. I will focus my remarks today on the use of explicit forward guidance as a tool for monetary policy. Before I start, let me briefly discuss near-term monetary policy. You likely already know that I have fully supported the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) decisions over the past several meetings. Those decisions were to increase the target range for the federal funds rate in 75 basis point increments, and the federal funds rate now stands at 3 to 3-1/4 percent. Inflation is much too high, and I strongly believe that bringing inflation back to our target is a necessary condition for meeting the goals mandated by Congress of price stability and maximum employment on a sustainable basis. Naturally, the focus is now on what will happen at the next FOMC meeting and beyond. At this point, for me, it comes down to what the incoming data and other economic information will tell us about the outlook for inflation. If we do not see signs that inflation is moving down, my view continues to be that sizable increases in the target range for the federal funds rate should remain on the table. However, if inflation starts to decline, I believe a slower pace of rate increases would be appropriate. To bring inflation down in a consistent and lasting way, the federal funds rate will need to move up to a restrictive level and remain there for some time. However, it is not yet clear how high we will need to raise the federal funds rate and how much time will pass before we begin to see inflation moving back down in a consistent and lasting way.  My general point is that inflation is much too high, and the outlook for inflation remains significantly uncertain. This uncertainty makes it very challenging to provide precise guidance on the path for the federal funds rate. With this in mind, I will turn to the main topic I'd like to discuss today, which is the potential role that explicit forward guidance can play as a monetary policy tool. Forward guidance is official FOMC communication that is intended to signal to the public the likely future path of monetary policy. In my remarks today, I will refer to explicit forward guidance as forward guidance that references specific economic outcomes that would need to be achieved, or a specific amount of time that would need to pass, before the Committee would take or consider taking a particular policy action. To be considered forward guidance, a statement does not need to be explicit about future policy actions or the timing of potential actions. It may be more qualitative in describing likely policy actions that may be taken in the future and, in some cases, may only describe how the FOMC will be thinking about its future decisions rather than signaling the likely future direction of policy actions. The intent of all forward guidance is to influence the public's expectations about the FOMC's future monetary policy actions, and in doing so, affect longer-term interest rates and broader financial conditions to help  support a path for inflation and economic activity that would be consistent with accomplishing t the Committee's price-stability and maximum-employment goals. As you know, over the past 20 years or so the Federal Reserve has increased the transparency and the frequency of its communications with the public, including through more frequent use of forward guidance in describing its monetary policy decisions. Let me stress here that I view clear and transparent communication with the public from the Federal Reserve as crucial to enable a better understanding of and to reinforce the effectiveness of our monetary policy actions, all of which help keep us accountable to the public. Over about the past 10 years, the use of explicit forward guidance has become an integral part of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy toolkit. In fact, explicit forward guidance is generally seen by many as especially helpful when use of the Committee's main monetary policy tool (changes to the federal funds rate) is constrained. This is when the rate has been lowered to zero, which we also call the effective lower bound. It is important to note that the degree of specificity contained in the Committee's forward guidance comes with tradeoffs. Explicit forward guidance hasn't always been viewed as a helpful addition to the monetary policy toolkit, particularly before the 2008 financial crisis. Before that time, while there was some acknowledgement that forward guidance could meaningfully affect financial conditions, there was a great deal of concern about the ""costs and risks"" of providing this type of guidance. These costs and risks included the confusion and potential financial market volatility that could result if the public did not fully understand the Committee's forward guidance. Another common  concern was that, if the Committee had to alter its forward guidance too frequently in response to rapidly changing economic conditions, its forward guidance could become ineffective (meaning that the public could heavily discount or simply disregard the guidance) or, worse, the public could come to question the Committee's overall credibility. A related worry was that if the Committee were too slow to alter its forward guidance--perhaps because it feared an outsized market reaction or a loss of credibility-- monetary policy could be more likely to fall behind the curve. In this regard, one cost of providing explicit forward guidance would be a loss of the flexibility needed to respond to changes in economic conditions as required by the pursuit of our price-stability and maximum-employment goals. On the whole, there was a consensus before the turn of the century that cost-benefit considerations did not favor the use of explicit forward guidance as a monetary policy tool. This was especially true when the benefits from providing such guidance--tightening or easing financial conditions--could be achieved in a more straightforward way. This could be accomplished in two ways--first, through simple changes in the federal funds rate and second, relying on the public to infer any future moves in the policy rate based on their own assessments of the FOMC's likely policy reactions to developments in inflation and economic activity. Over time, Federal Reserve officials began to more seriously consider the possible benefits that forward guidance could provide to the effectiveness of the FOMC's monetary policy decisions by influencing longer-term interest rates in a way that aided the Committee's achievement of its statutory price stability and maximum-employment goals. Starting in 1999, the FOMC began to release a public statement after each of its  meetings. And beginning in 2000, in addition to describing the current policy decision, the post-meeting statement contained a paragraph on the ""balance of risks"" that was meant to indicate how the Committee ""assesses the risks of heightened inflation pressures or economic weakness in the foreseeable future."" The time frame in the new language was intended to cover a period extending beyond the next FOMC meeting and was meant to give an indication of the likely direction of future policy decisions based on the Committee's assessment of the economic outlook. Beginning in 2003, the FOMC post- meeting statement began to include more direct, but still qualitative, forward guidance regarding the future path of the federal funds rate. Notably, this forward guidance did not reference explicit outcomes or specific timelines that would guide the FOMC's future policy decisions. Evidence suggests that the shift toward more transparent communication by the FOMC in the early 2000s, including its use of forward guidance, allowed financial market participants to better anticipate changes in the stance of monetary policy, which were then reflected in broader financial conditions.  The 2008 financial crisis significantly altered most assessments of the costs and benefits of providing more explicit forward guidance. With the federal funds rate remaining at near-zero levels for several years after that crisis, the Committee had to look for new tools to change its policy stance and affect financial conditions. Explicit forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases quickly emerged as the two main new tools of monetary policy. In a way, explicit forward guidance was seen as providing monetary policy accommodation when the current setting of the federal funds rate could not. providing guidance on specific outcomes that would need to be achieved before the FOMC would consider raising the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee could help reduce uncertainty regarding its future policy decisions and keep longer-term interest rates low as the economic recovery progressed. In addition, with the risks to the outlook generally seen as tilted to the downside in the years that followed the financial crisis, using explicit forward guidance to signal a ""low for longer"" policy was not seen as  posing significant risks to the Committee's credibility, because short-term interest rates were generally expected to remain unusually low during those years. I should note, however, that even then, low-for-long policies did raise some financial stability concerns, such as those related to reach-for-yield behavior. In addition, the outcome-based forward guidance employed by the FOMC in the years following the financial crisis explicitly recognized the possibility that inflationary pressures could emerge. It incorporated a version of an ""escape clause"" in its forward guidance that would prompt a reconsideration of the policy stance should such inflationary pressures emerge. In particular, in its December 2012 statement, the Committee noted that it expected the target range for the federal funds rate to remain at 0 to 1/4 percent for ""at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well Of course, today's circumstances are much different from those we faced during most of the decade that followed the 2008 financial crisis. I will focus here on two features of our current environment that I see as especially relevant for assessing the role of explicit forward guidance as a monetary policy tool in the current conduct of monetary policy. The first is that with inflation unacceptably high and the resulting urgent need to remove monetary policy accommodation, the federal funds rate is no longer near zero. The Committee can now indicate its intended stance of monetary policy through changes  to the target range for the federal funds rate--its stated primary tool of monetary policy-- rather than relying on more unconventional monetary policy tools, such as forward guidance and balance sheet policy, to serve as the main indicators of the stance of monetary policy. The second is that the outlook for inflation and economic activity is especially uncertain, with significant two-sided risks. Gone are the days when the risks to the outlook were skewed to the downside, especially with respect to inflation. And two-sided risks to economic activity are also widely recognized by the public, with press reports of an overheating labor market often featured alongside discussions of high or rising recession risks. In our current environment, I view the benefits of providing explicit forward guidance as lower than they were in the years immediately after the 2008 crisis. Given that the federal funds rate is now well above zero, the FOMC can communicate changes in the stance of monetary policy through changes in the target range for the federal funds rate and not rely on explicit forward guidance as it did when the federal funds rate was at the effective lower bound. And I would argue that the costs and risks of providing explicit forward guidance are now higher than they were in the decade that followed the last financial crisis. For example, relative to current conditions, it was easier and less risky to provide explicit forward guidance back then (especially guidance of the low-for-longer variety). After all, back then, the economy was still weighed down by the after-effects of the 2008 financial crisis, and inflation was running persistently below our 2 percent target. Let's contrast those conditions with the ones we face today. With uncertainty about the economic outlook unusually high today, the pre-2000s concerns about  providing explicit forward guidance have regained their relevance. High uncertainty about the outlook puts a premium on flexibility, and--to the extent that the Committee sees a cost to frequent changes to its forward guidance--the provision of explicit forward guidance could reduce the Committee's flexibility to respond to unexpected changes in economic conditions. The Committee's experience in the second half of last year illustrates this point. Looking back, one might reasonably argue that during that time the Committee's explicit forward guidance for both the federal funds rate and asset purchases contributed to a situation where the stance of monetary policy remained too accommodative for too long--even as inflation was rising and showing signs of becoming more broad-based than previously thought. The facts on the ground were changing quickly and significantly, but the communication of our policy stance was not keeping pace, which meant that our policy stance was not keeping pace. As late as November 2021, our forward guidance still indicated that the Committee intended to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent ""until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time."" And we were still purchasing assets at the same pace we had earlier in the year, although we did announce in November 2021 that we would start slowing the pace of our purchases in December. With the benefit of  hindsight, one might ask whether we would have moved sooner to remove monetary policy accommodation if we hadn't been so explicit about our forward guidance in prior months--particularly forward guidance that had set such a high bar for slowing our asset purchases and starting to raise rates. Of course, the fact that some of the data that were directly relevant to our decision-making did not accurately reflect the economic conditions prevailing at the time--and which were subsequently revised--likely also led to a delay in the removal of monetary policy accommodation in 2021. More generally, I will note that high uncertainty and two-sided risks to the outlook raise some practical questions for the use of explicit forward guidance in the current monetary policy environment. For example, how can the Committee provide explicit forward guidance about the path of the federal funds rate when overall macroeconomic uncertainty makes it more challenging for the Committee to know beforehand the size and timing of its future policy moves? Putting it all together, what lessons can we take for the use of explicit forward guidance in today's economic environment? A key point to me is that a cost-benefit analysis similar to that which I've just discussed here suggests that the case for explicit forward guidance is much less compelling today than it was in the years that immediately followed the 2008 financial crisis. My own view is that discussions about the use of explicit forward guidance as a policy tool should be limited. It should be used during periods when the Committee cannot adjust the federal funds rate any lower due to the effective lower bound, and when the Committee also has reasonable confidence that that  the federal funds rate will need to remain near zero for a period of time to stimulate growth and when inflationary pressures are expected to be subdued. Even in such periods, the Committee should recognize possible risks to a low-for-long monetary policy stance, including upside risks to inflation, and provide escape clauses that would detail the circumstances that would cause the Committee to reevaluate its policy stance. Outside of such periods, our focus should be on changes in the target range for the federal funds rate--the Committee's primary tool for implementing monetary policy decisions--in communicating the stance of monetary policy and in providing more qualitative guidance regarding how the Committee will be thinking about its future policy decisions. Our recent experience with using qualitative forward guidance in our post- meeting statements illustrates this point. In the first half of this year, when the Committee began to signal that it would increase the target range for the federal funds rate and that it anticipated that ""ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate,"" longer-term interest rates rose and financial conditions tightened. However, being more explicit in our communications regarding the likely size of the increases in the target range at each future meeting was not helpful during this time, because our decisions depended on the incoming data and its implications for the outlook. Before I conclude, I will emphasize, again, that, my reservations about explicit forward guidance notwithstanding, I am a strong believer in the role of communication in the conduct of monetary policy. Clear and transparent communications with the public reinforce the effectiveness of our monetary policy and keep us accountable to the public.  Under current circumstances, however, the best we can do on the public communications front is, first, to continue to stress our unwavering resolve to do what is needed to restore price stability. Second, as Chair Powell noted recently, we should acknowledge that the outlook for inflation and economic activity is subject to unusual uncertainty, and that, as a result, we will be making our policy decisions on a meeting-by-meeting basis. we should continue to reiterate that we will remain ""highly attentive to inflation risks."" This is probably the best and clearest forward guidance we can provide at this point. Thank you again for the opportunity to share my views with you today.","['inflationary', 'inflation', 'macroeconomic', 'monetary', 'guidance']","['guidance monetary', 'inflation target', 'inflation running', 'policy inflation', 'inflation rising']","['guidance current monetary', 'forward guidance monetary', 'guidance monetary policy', 'monetary policy inflation', 'policy stance inflationary']","['future monetary policy actions', 'current monetary policy environment', 'long monetary policy stance', 'monetary policy actions', 'monetary policy']"
6135,r221012a_BOE,united kingdom,2022-10-12,Monetary policy: an anchor in challenging times,pill,0,"Huw Pill talks about how we will bring inflation down, and why we have acted to stabilise financial markets. He explains how the work we do is different to the government's job of taxing and spending, which can provide more immediate support to the economy. Then he sets out how we acted in the government bond market to make sure instability in financial markets does not spread to UK households and businesses. Good afternoon everyone. It is a great pleasure to be with you in Glasgow today. My thanks to the Scottish Council for Development and Industry for their invitation to speak, to the University of Strathclyde for hosting us, and of course to all of you for taking the time to attend. I am looking forward to our discussion. I have spent the past couple of days here in Scotland talking with firms, speaking to business leaders and engaging with our Citizens Panel. As you can imagine, some of those discussions have been challenging. We are living through challenging times. The invasion of Ukraine has led to a dramatic rise in European wholesale gas prices. Household incomes are being squeezed by higher energy bills. Company profits are being squeezed by higher energy costs. And headline inflation has risen to unacceptably high levels. For a net importer of energy like the UK, the rise in global energy prices weighs on national income: the cost of what we are buying from the rest of the world has risen dramatically relative to the price of what we are selling. You don't need to be an economist to understand the implications of this for domestic demand. Higher energy prices dampen household spending, and weigh on economic activity. On top of all this, the strength of the labour market has pushed up costs through wage inflation. And recently we have seen greater volatility in financial markets: both globally and, with particular force, here in the UK. That has intensified in some market segments over recent days. As someone who joined the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) just over a year ago, it has certainly been something of a baptism of fire. More profoundly, the past year has been difficult for all of us. Compared with twelve months ago: household utility bills are much higher than expected; the prospect of higher mortgage payments looms larger; and the outlook for economic activity looks weaker. None of this is good news. But, there is at least one constant in the face of all these challenges. The MPC remains fully committed to delivering on its mandate - to maintain price stability - by fulfilling its remit - to return inflation to the 2% target. Despite difficult circumstances, that commitment is unwavering. Monetary policy really is an anchor in these challenging times. And these are not just empty words. In pursuit of its inflation target, the MPC has raised Bank Rate in each of its last seven meetings. It has brought QE to an end and started to run down its holdings of gilts accumulated for monetary policy purposes. And it has changed the nature of its communication. We have moved away from the forward guidance that signalled Bank Rate would remain floored at its effective lower bound that met me when joining the MPC last year. In its place, the MPC has emphasised that its policy decisions are driven by the evolution of the data, while signalling a willingness to respond more forcefully to signs of greater persistence in inflation, should that prove necessary. At every juncture, the MPC has remained committed to a medium-term view that stabilises inflation around the 2% target. In that spirit, a couple of weeks ago I argued at a talk in London that the significant market reaction and economic implications of recent macro news - including recent fiscal policy news - was likely to prompt a significant monetary policy response at the MPC's next meeting on 3 November. Of course, that rendezvous is still some time away. And, of course, much can happen in the intervening period, with markets exhibiting volatility and the geo-political and economic environment uncertain. Anyway I can only speak for myself today, not for the nine-member committee as a whole. But as things stand, I stand by my London statement. Given where we are, I continue to expect a significant monetary policy action at the MPC's next scheduled meeting. So in the body of my remarks this afternoon, I don't want to dwell further on what we are trying to achieve or whether we are working towards it. I hope I have made my views on those two questions very clear. Rather I want to discuss how the MPC is working towards achieving the 2% target. Just as no man is an island, no economic policymaker works completely in isolation. Let me start with a few comments on this observation, starting with the interactions between monetary and fiscal policies. Monetary policy is a potentially very powerful tool, central to achieving stability in the overall price level by steering inflation back to target. But monetary policy is also a pretty blunt tool, ill-designed to deal with the distributional consequences of relative price changes - changes in the price of one good compared with another. Recent experience in the face of dramatic increases in energy prices illustrates this point. Monetary policy has been tightened to ensure that the impulse to headline inflation coming from higher utility bills does not become embedded in broader inflationary developments. It has weighed against the incorporation of so-called second-round effects in price, wage and cost setting behaviour. In other words, monetary policy has addressed the danger that self-fulfilling dynamics lead to overall price inflation remaining persistently above target, even as the original impetus to inflation from energy prices recedes. By contrast, the fiscal response to energy price developments has been more targeted. It has addressed the risk that those households and firms which consume more energy as a proportion of their income and/or lack the savings or access to external finance that might help them deal with the cash-flow implications of sharply higher energy bills - in other words, less well-off households and small businesses - could not manage the dramatic energy-driven cost-of-living squeeze that threatened over the summer. The UK Government's Energy Price Guarantee (EPG) is the main vehicle here. Decisions such as these are, rightly, in the domain of the government and not for independent central banks to make. However, I will discuss the implications for our economic forecasts in a moment. But I want to flag that the MPC's most recent baseline projection published in the August Monetary Policy Report incorporated the significant increases in European wholesale gas prices we experienced over the summer, but - owing to the pause implied by changes in political leadership- did not incorporate a fiscal policy response to those increases. This reflected the MPC's usual conventions and assumptions underlying the production of its forecasts, but - in the specific circumstances faced at the time - resulted in a baseline projection with debateable internal consistency. The Committee took the unusual step of distancing itself from that baseline in August, and relied more heavily on complementary analysis in scenarios and variants in motivating its decision. Now that the UK Government's fiscal energy measures have been announced, the more comprehensive, integrated assessment that will be embodied in our November forecast can resume its central place in our analysis for, and communication of, monetary policy decisions. The EPG has capped the expected average energy bill at PS2500, for the next two years, a substantially lower level than the earlier Ofgem price cap mechanism would have implied given the evolution of wholesale gas prices. Steps have also been taken to help firms. Higher gas prices will now increase the (indirect) government subsidy to energy users, rather than the utility bills they pay. This shifts the main macro risks stemming from gas price rises away from higher headline inflation and a squeeze on household real incomes towards greater pressure on the fiscal deficit and ultimately the public finances more widely. Ensuring that this shift - in concert with other fiscal policy actions - does not bring the longer-term sustainability of the public finances or respect for the wider institutional framework for macroeconomic policy into question remains key: both in and of itself, but also because maintaining the credibility and integrity of that framework supports the effectiveness of monetary policy in pursuing its own objectives. In this context, it is welcome that the role played by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) in scrutinising the Government's fiscal plans will be resumed in the forthcoming budget statement. Its independent, external scrutiny of the outlook for the public finances will bolster the credibility of the process, thereby helping to add stability in what is a volatile environment at present. The need for a balance between, on the one hand, targeted and timely action on other dimensions to complement monetary policy decisions (which, by nature, have a broader and more medium-term impact) and, on the other hand, wider respect for the institutional framework for macro policy, also arises in the context of actions taken by the Bank and other actors to support the functioning of financial markets for financial stability purposes. Monetary policy works through the financial system. Monetary policymakers therefore have a stake in liquid and well-functioning markets as vehicles for the transmission of their policy decisions. More widely, the Bank of England as a whole has an obvious interest in maintaining orderly markets that support healthy price formation and an efficient allocation of capital and resources. The Bank also has a statutory responsibility for financial stability, which it takes very seriously. In the face of dysfunction that has emerged in some specific market segments in recent weeks, the Bank is conducting a set of temporary and targeted financial stability operations to support the gilt market. Their goal has been to permit an orderly deleveraging of positions held by so-called liability driven investment (LDI) funds, which became vulnerable in the volatile market conditions we have seen of late. In taking this action, the Bank has sought to prevent the emergence of a self-sustaining vicious spiral of collateral calls, forced sales and disappearing liquidity from emerging in a core segment of the financial markets. Restoring market functioning helps reduce any risks from contagion to credit conditions for UK households and businesses. Such actions preserve the effective transmission of monetary policy. But crucially they are not monetary policy actions in themselves. Were monetary policy to be re-oriented towards serving financial stability ends, not only would it be less effective in addressing dysfunction than more temporary and targeted interventions in specific dis-orderly market segments, but it would also be distracted from its central task of maintaining price stability and returning inflation to the 2% target. At the time of writing, this distinction between monetary policy actions and actions taken by the Bank to support financial stability has been recognised and priced by market participants. In the face of a substantial re-pricing of financial assets a few weeks ago, markets originally anticipated that Bank Rate - the active instrument of monetary policy in the eyes of the MPC - might be changed at an ad hoc meeting outside the regular schedule of MPC decisions. But in the wake of both (1) clear communication that the MPC remained focused on its November meeting, when a comprehensive assessment of the macroeconomic and market news as interpreted through its forecast would be available; and (2) the introduction of temporary and targeted financial stability operations designed to address specific cases of market dysfunction, any inter-meeting rise in Bank Rate was largely priced out. Market participants had come to understand that monetary policy would remain focused on the outlook for inflation, leaving other mechanisms to address market dysfunction. Going forward, maintaining this distinction remains key to monetary policy's pursuit of the inflation target. More generally, whether reflecting pressures from the fiscal, financial or other domains, it is essential that the credibility, stability and integrity of the institutional framework governing UK macroeconomic policies are maintained. This is the environment within which the Bank's monetary policy operates most effectively. Preserving that framework requires that policymakers are assigned clearly-defined responsibilities; that they strive to achieve clearly-identified objectives; and that their institutional independence - and that of other policy actors - is fully respected. Having set out thoughts about the institutional environment for monetary policy, let me conclude with a few more specific observations about the macroeconomic conjuncture. I'll express these through the medium of my interpretation of what is often called the MPC's 'monetary policy reaction function'. When coming to monetary policy decisions, I take a 'full information approach'. I don't want to throw out any potentially relevant information on arbitrary grounds. Consistent with this approach, when asked about the role monetary aggregates play in my policy thinking at a recent Treasury Select Committee hearing, I sought to steer a course between recognising that monetary developments can - and often do - offer important insights into the outlook for the economy and monetary policy, but at the same time noting that money is not a 'summary statistic' that alone can or should determine monetary policy decisions. Monetary developments need to be incorporated into a wider assessment of the economic outlook, such as the MPC forecast that we publish regularly in the Monetary Policy Report. The importance attached to money in that context will vary over time and depend on interactions with other variables. For example, last year the likelihood of stronger consumption spending by households as we recovered from the pandemic could be assessed by evaluating the 'monetary overhang' - the stock of household bank deposits held in excess of what might have been expected on the basis of historical norms - that was accumulated during lockdown. The same thinking applies to any macroeconomic or market information. In principle, it should be considered relevant to the extent that it informs well-designed monetary policy actions. That is why the MPC has placed such weight on its forthcoming forecast round, where a comprehensive and encompassing assessment of all sources of relevant information can be made, which internalises the interactions and interdependencies among various time series. But I realise that saying all information is potentially equally important runs the risk of suggesting that all information equally unimportant. To give an insight into my decision process, some hierarchy of analysis is required. So, I will highlight here three areas that weigh heavily at present on my thinking. . Over the summer, there has been considerable news on this dimension, which the MPC only partially digested in its September policy assessment and decision. I have already mentioned the Energy Price Guarantee. Relative to where we might otherwise have expected to be early next year on the basis of wholesale gas futures prices, the introduction of the PS2500 cap on an average energy bill directly reduces CPI inflation. Of itself, the resulting lower and flatter profile for headline inflation should diminish the risks coming from potential second round effects, and a make shift towards more inflationary psychology less likely. Against that, lower utility bills will support current household real incomes and thereby support consumption demand. With demand pressure more sustained than otherwise, inflationary pressures may prove more persistent than would have been expected. On balance, I would expect the net effect of these various channels to add to inflationary pressures at the traditional monetary policy relevant horizon of around two years. More recently, the Government announced its Growth Plan a few weeks ago. As with any fiscal package, this plan embodies a variety of demand, supply and market impacts that are relevant for the macroeconomic outlook. We will need to assess all these elements and the interactions among them within our November forecast. At this stage, I would simply make two preliminary observations. On my reading, these fiscal announcements will, on balance, provide a further stimulus to demand relative to supply over the medium-term, monetary policy relevant horizon. This will add to the inflationary pressure coming from the EPG. And, the volatile market dynamics that followed the announcement of the Growth Plan underline the need to bolster the credibility of the wider institutional framework, in line with my earlier remarks. . As I have already mentioned, it is crucial that we prevent higher current headline inflation from becoming embedded in inflation expectations and price and wage setting behaviour, a risk intensified by the current tightness of the labour market. Heading off this risk will prevent the current energy price-driven overshoot of the inflation target from becoming more persistent and requiring a more painful monetary policy response down the road. As I have already said, the EPG helps somewhat in this regard. But, at least in my view, it remains too early to declare victory on this front. Inflation remains very high relative both to our 2% target and by the historical standards of the past 40 years. Even if the energy price guarantee has reduced inflation relative to what would have otherwise have seen this autumn, most people's 'lived experience' is a rise in October's headline inflation rate as utility prices increase. While we have good estimates of how the EPG will affect the household utility bills that enter the consumer price index directly, the impact of government relief for the corporate sector on consumer prices is more difficult to assess, as firms seek to re-establish margins and the incidence of the energy price support feeds through the price pipeline. In this context, medium-term measures of inflation compensation from financial markets have moved around since August, and current market volatility makes them difficult to interpret over recent weeks. But the sustained (and reassuring) downward trend that in market inflation expectations that emerged from early April appears to have come to an end, at least for now. Household and corporate surveys of inflation expectations at various horizons - although subject to methodological shortcomings and offering sometimes inconsistent messages - have, on balance, moved in an unfavourable direction, especially if one points weight on the distribution of views not just the median. And third, . Yesterday's labour market data showed the unemployment rate falling to 3.5%, the lowest level observed since 1974. While at first read this looks like a rare piece of good news, viewed through the lens of efforts to return inflation to target it is a mixed blessing. Indeed, the association with the mid-1970s is not reassuring in that respect. Tight labour markets support wage growth, currently running at rates above those we typically deem as consistent with the inflation target. Crucially, the low unemployment rate reflects a fall in labour market participation to a significant extent. In other words, people are choosing to stop working or looking for work. The reasons for this rise in 'inactivity' are still being explored, but the after-effects of the pandemic on health are probably a key driver. Aside from the impact of long Covid, the backlog of operations and lengthening of waiting lists in the health service owing to the pandemic, the rise in mental health issues, and an increased need to provide at-home care for family members have all weighed on labour force participation. This is an area where we need further work, since the UK appears to be something of an outlier relative to its advanced economy peers. Another supply-side driver of labour market development is migration. Understanding the impact of Brexit and new government policies in the area are key. Demand issues are also now beginning to exert an influence. As the economy slowed through this year, vacancies have turned. Employment has stagnated and is now showing tentative signs of falling. This will help to cool the labour market and contain some of the domestically-driven inflationary pressures that historically have threatened to become more persistent. These are the three main arguments of my monetary policy reaction function at present. Developments on these three fronts will shape my policy decision in November. As I have hinted, these three elements are not only important in themselves, but they also interact with and feedback from one another, in ways that can only really be captured by an encompassing analysis. That is why it is valuable and necessary to base our next policy decision on the comprehensive assessment embodied in our November policy round, which will ultimately be reflected in the November MPC forecast. Given the uncertain world and volatile markets we face, November can seem a long time away. At present, I am still inclined to believe that a significant monetary policy response will be required to the significant macro and market news of the past few weeks. But I will see when we get to November how events have evolved in the meantime. As always, my policy choices will be driven by the data and guided by pursuit of the inflation target. And with that, I am happy to take your questions. The views expressed in this speech are not necessarily those of the Bank of England or the Monetary Policy Committee. I would particularly like to thank Saba Alam and Will Dowson for their help in preparing this speech. I have received helpful comments from Andrew Bailey, Fabrizio Cadamagnani, Alan Castle, Swati Dhingra, Jonathan Haskel, Neil Kisserli, Catherine Mann, Martin Seneca and Fergal Shortall, for which I am most grateful.","['glasgow', 'inflationary', 'scotland', 'inflation', 'demand']","['uk macroeconomic', 'bring inflation', 'scottish council', 'pleasure glasgow', 'government energy']","['uk government energy', 'uk intensified market', 'uk macroeconomic policies', 'energy like uk', 'scottish council development']","['scottish council', 'uk government', 'higher energy prices', 'glasgow today', 'broader inflationary developments']"
7687,r221014a_FOMC,united states,2022-10-14,The U.S. Dollar and Central Bank Digital Currencies,waller,0,"Thank you, Professor Jackson, and thank you to the for the invitation to speak at this symposium. As the payment system continues to evolve rapidly and the volume of digital assets continues to grow, it is critical to ensure that we keep both the benefits and risks of digital assets in the policy conversation, including the implications for America's role in the global economy and its place in the world. My speech today focuses on exactly this issue and on an aspect of the digital asset world that is now the center of domestic and international attention--central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and how they relate to the substantial international role of the U.S. dollar. In January 2022, the Federal Reserve Board published a discussion paper on CBDCs to foster a broad and transparent public dialogue, including the potential benefits and risks of a U.S. CBDC. To date, no decisions have been made by the Board on whether to move forward with a CBDC. But my views are well known. As I have said before, I am highly skeptical of whether there is a compelling need for the Fed to create a digital currency. I am not a national security expert. But one area where economics, CBDCs, and national security dovetail is the role of the dollar. Advocates for creating a U.S. CBDC often assert how it is important to the long-term status of the dollar, particularly if other major jurisdictions adopt a CBDC. I disagree. As I will discuss, the underlying reasons  for why the dollar is the dominant currency have little to do with technology, and I believe the introduction of a CBDC would not affect those underlying reasons. I offer this view, again, in the spirit of dialogue, knowing how important these issues are, and I am very happy to engage in vigorous debate regarding my view. I remain open to the arguments advanced by others in this space. served as the central currency for the international monetary system. Other countries agreed to keep the exchange value of their currencies fixed to the dollar, and eventually, countries came to settle international balances in dollars. That role has continued long after the Bretton Woods system dissolved. By any measure, the dollar is the dominant global currency--for funding markets, foreign exchange transactions, and invoicing. It also is the world's predominant reserve currency. In terms of the dollar's reserve currency status, 60 percent of disclosed official foreign reserves are held in dollars, far surpassing the shares of other currencies, with the majority of these dollar reserves held in safe and liquid U.S. Treasury securities. in a world of largely floating exchange rates, many countries either implicitly or  explicitly anchor their currencies to the dollar; together, these countries account for about half of world gross domestic product. The dollar is by far the dominant currency for international trade. Apart from intra-European trade, dollar invoicing is used in more than three-fourths of global trade, including 96 percent of trade in the Americas. Approximately 60 percent of international and foreign currency liabilities--international banking loans and deposits as well as international debt securities--are denominated in dollars. And the dollar remains the single most widely used currency in foreign exchange transactions. Why does this matter to the United States? As indicated in the Board's CBDC discussion paper, the dollar's international role lowers transaction and borrowing costs for U.S. households, businesses, and government. It widens the pool of creditors and investors for U.S. investments. It may insulate the U.S. economy from shocks from abroad. It also allows the United States to influence standards for the global monetary system. The dollar's role doesn't only benefit the United States. The dollar serves as a safe, stable, and dependable form of money around the world. It serves as a reliable common denominator for global trade and a dependable settlement instrument for cross- border payments. In the process, it reduces the cost of transferring capital and smooths the world of global payments, including for households and businesses outside of  For example, consider the dollar's role in foreign exchange markets. To make a foreign exchange transaction between two lightly traded currencies, it is often less expensive to trade the first currency with the dollar, and then to trade the dollar with the second currency, rather than to trade the two currencies directly. The factors driving the dollar's role as a reserve currency are well researched and well demonstrated, including the depth and liquidity of U.S. financial markets, the size and openness of the U.S. economy, and international trust in U.S. institutions and the rule of law. We must keep these factors in mind in any debate regarding the long-term importance of the dollar. Threats to the U.S. dollar's international dominance are numerous, including shifting geopolitical alliances and pressure to invoice in alternative currencies, as well as deeper and more open foreign financial markets. My focus today is on just one supposed threat--namely, the purported shifting payments landscape as a result of the growth of digital assets, particularly CBDCs. Recent years have seen a number of changes to the payments system, from instant interbank payments to mobile payment services to a shift toward nonbank payment providers. Some of this shift has been through the rise in digital assets and include cryptocurrencies and other crypto-assets such as stablecoins, which have money-like characteristics. They also include CBDCs. A CBDC is a digital instrument that is a liability of the central bank. That is all it is--a direct liability of a central bank.  What major security gap exists that a CBDC, and only a CBDC, can close? What would be the effect of CBDCs and other digital money-like instruments on the role of the dollar? There are many ways to approach this question, but I want to do so by using a simple example: What is it about a CBDC that would make a non-U.S. company, engaging in international financial transactions, more or less likely to use the dollar? This example, of course, focuses on the reasons for why contracts are generally invoiced in U.S. dollars, which is just one feature of the dollar's international role. To me, however, it simplifies the overall question regarding the effect of a CBDC on the dollar's dominance. We can break down this question into three others: First, would a foreign CBDC And, third, while stablecoins are not CBDCs, how would a privately issued stablecoin have a different effect? First, I will consider the emergence of one or more foreign CBDCs in a world the company acts pragmatically; it would only move away from using the U.S. dollar if it is better off by doing so. The discussion around this question usually tends to focus on the potential technological advantages of a CBDC and doesn't grapple with the underlying reasons for the dominance of the dollar. That is, advocates for a CBDC tend to promote the potential for a CBDC to reduce payment frictions by lowering transaction costs, enabling faster settlement speeds, and providing a better user experience. I am highly skeptical that a CBDC on its own could sufficiently reduce the traditional payment  frictions to prevent things like fraud, theft, money laundering, or the financing of terrorism. Though CBDC systems may be able to automate a number of processes that, in part, address these challenges, they are not unique in doing so. Meaningful efforts are under way at the international level to improve cross-border payments in many ways, with the vast majority of these improvements coming not from CBDCs but improvements to existing payment systems. For argument's sake, though, let's suppose that this foreign CBDC is more attractive for payments to the non-U.S. company, perhaps for technological reasons, or because the preferences of the firm's consumers or trading partners change in response to the introduction of the CBDC. Due to the well-known network effects in payments, the more users the foreign CBDC acquires, the greater will be the pressure on the non-U.S. company to also use the foreign CBDC. In this case, it is true that the appeal of the foreign CBDC as a transactions medium--not as a unit account or store of value--might gain at the expense of the dollar. These effects will likely only be on the margin because they rely on a large enough number of individuals and businesses being nearly indifferent between the dollar and the foreign currency in CBDC form. But the broader factors underpinning the dollar's international role would not change. Changing those factors would require large geopolitical shifts separate from CBDC issuance, including greater availability of attractive safe assets and liquid financial  markets in other jurisdictions that are at least on par with, if not better than, those that exist in the United States. The factors supporting the primacy of the dollar are not technological, but include the ample supply and liquid market for U.S. Treasury securities and other debt and the long-standing stability of the U.S. economy and political system. No other country is fully comparable with the United States on those fronts, and a CBDC would not change that. Finally, as I've noted before, it is possible that a foreign-issued CBDC could have the opposite of its intended effect and make companies even less willing to use that country's currency. Since digital currencies would make it easier for a government to monitor transactions, shifting to a CBDC might make a company less willing to use that country's currency. For example, I suspect that many companies will remain wary of China's CBDC for just this reason. I am also skeptical that a U.S. CBDC would affect this hypothetical foreign company's decisionmaking. A U.S. CBDC is unlikely to dramatically reshape the liquidity or depth of U.S. capital markets. It is unlikely to affect the openness of the U.S. economy, reconfigure trust in U.S. institutions, or deepen America's commitment to the rule of law. As I have said before, the introduction of a U.S. CBDC would come with a number of costs and risks, including cyber risk and the threat of disintermediating commercial banks, both of which could harm, rather than help, the U.S. dollar's standing  internationally. Like a foreign CBDC, the technological advantages of a U.S. CBDC would have a hard time overcoming long-standing payments frictions without violating international financial integrity standards. For the non-U.S. company already conducting its business in dollars, introducing a U.S. CBDC would not provide material benefits over and above the current reasons for making U.S. dollar-denominated payments. For non- U.S. companies conducting their business in currencies other than dollars, a U.S. CBDC similarly would likely not be preferred to their current options. It could be that individuals outside the United States would find a U.S. CBDC particularly attractive, but, again, making a U.S. CBDC globally available would raise a number of issues, including money laundering and international financial stability concerns. And as with a foreign- issued CBDC, the dollar's function as a unit of account and store of value is unlikely to be affected, resulting in a limited effect on the international role of the dollar. The last scenario I want to consider is one in which a privately issued stablecoin pegged to a sovereign currency is available for international payments. Stablecoins are crypto-assets that aim to maintain a stable value relative to a specified asset or pool of assets. The reasons that stablecoins may be more attractive than existing options for payments include their ability to provide real-time payments at lower cost between countries that were previously poorly serviced and to provide a safe store of value for individuals residing in or transacting with countries with weak economic fundamentals. This is different than an intermediated U.S. CBDC, for which access in developing  economies would depend on banks' incentives to provide such access. Stablecoins, however, may be held directly in any country that allows its citizens to do so. To improve payments, especially for jurisdictions that are not well served under the current global payments ecosystem, stablecoins must be risk-managed and subject to a robust supervisory and regulatory framework. Could such an asset affect the role of the U.S. dollar? Once again, I am unsure whether even a large issuance of a stablecoin could have anything more than a marginal effect. It has often been suggested by commentators that private money-like instruments such as stablecoins threaten the effectiveness of monetary policy. I don't believe that to be the case, and it should be noted that nearly all the major stablecoins to date are denominated in dollars, and therefore U.S. monetary policy should affect the decision to hold stablecoins similar to the decision to hold currency. This follows from a vast body of evidence in international economics showing how countries pegging their exchange rates effectively import monetary policy from the country to which their currency is pegged. Also, because stablecoins are pegged to the dollar, they may increase rather than reduce the primacy of the dollar abroad, since demand for stablecoins increases demand for dollar-denominated reserve assets held by the stablecoin issuer. The ongoing debate over the risks and benefits of a CBDC is important, and I am happy to continue to engage with both advocates and skeptics of CBDCs. But, for the reasons I have laid out, I don't think there are implications here for the role of the United  States in the global economy and financial system. We should instead focus and debate the salient CBDC-related topics, like its effects on financial stability, payment system improvements, and financial inclusion. Thank you again for having me to participate in this fantastic event.","['currencies', 'monetary', 'currency', 'treasury', 'fed']","['digital currency', 'digital currencies', 'currency digital', 'currencies cbdcs', 'currency cbdc']","['digital currencies cbdcs', 'cbdcs digital money', 'digital currency national', 'bank digital currencies', 'dollars introducing cbdc']","['digital currency', 'digital currencies', 'other digital money', 'federal reserve board', 'digital assets']"
3243,r221014a_ECB,euro area,2022-10-14,IMFC Statement,lagarde,1,"Global growth momentum has slowed since our previous meeting in April, as high energy prices and geopolitical uncertainty take their toll on economic activity. The remaining supply-related headwinds are also acting as a drag on growth, although these are gradually easing. Russia's war against Ukraine has pushed energy prices higher and disrupted global food supply chains, fuelling inflationary pressures worldwide and raising concerns about global food security. Pandemic-related restrictions are less widespread than before but may continue to hamper global economic activity via renewed supply-side disruptions. And the exceptionally strong inflationary pressures are weighing on people's disposable income and the savings they built up during the pandemic. Overall, the global inflation outlook and the global economic outlook are both fraught with uncertainty. Monetary policy needs to ensure that inflation does not become entrenched and that it returns to target in the medium term. And fiscal policy needs to be carefully calibrated to country-specific circumstances to protect the most vulnerable groups from the cost-of-living crisis while preserving debt sustainability and without adding to inflationary pressures. Inflation in the euro area is far too high, and it is likely to stay above the ECB's target for an extended period of time. We will therefore continue along our monetary policy normalisation path. Key ECB interest rates were raised by 50 basis points in July and 75 basis points in September. This has frontloaded the transition from the prevailing highly accommodative policy rates towards levels that will ensure the timely return of inflation to our 2% medium-term target. The ECB's Governing Council expects to raise interest rates further over the next several meetings, based on a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach. Furthermore, our new Transmission Protection Instrument is available to counter unwarranted, disorderly market dynamics that pose a serious threat to the effective transmission of our monetary policy stance across all euro area countries. Finally, we are countering pandemic-related risks to the transmission mechanism by applying flexibility when reinvesting redemptions coming due in the pandemic emergency purchase programme portfolio. Euro area real GDP growth was robust in the first half of 2022, supported by the reopening of economies in the second quarter as pandemic-related restrictions were lifted. However, the outlook has since darkened due to high inflation, waning reopening effects, weakening global demand and falling confidence. These factors are likely to cause a significant slowdown in euro area GDP growth in the second half of the year and early 2023. But there are also factors supporting GDP growth, such as the level of accumulated household savings, a robust labour market and fiscal support, including the ongoing deployment of EU Recovery and Resilience Facility funds. Overall, however, risks to growth are primarily on the downside, particularly because of the economic consequences of the war in Ukraine. Fiscal policy remains key to buffering the shock from the war and should continue to provide a lifeline to households and firms facing a steep rise in energy bills. At the same time, fiscal support measures should be temporary and targeted at the most vulnerable households and firms - those who are bearing the brunt of higher energy prices - to limit the risk of fuelling inflationary pressures and to make public spending more efficient. And these measures need to be supported by an accelerated clean energy transition, including through additional public investment. With monetary policy normalising, the focus of fiscal policy will need to shift progressively towards measures that preserve debt sustainability without endangering the recovery in the medium term. Inflation has continued to rise and reached 10% in September. The increase was larger than expected, mainly due to energy and food price inflation. Energy price inflation remains extremely high and is the dominant component of overall inflation. Food prices have also increased further, reflecting higher energy input costs, disruptions to trade in food commodities and adverse weather conditions. Price pressures are spreading across more and more sectors, partly owing to the impact of high energy costs and supply bottlenecks, but also because of recovering demand in the services sector. As the current sources of inflation fade over time and we continue along the path of monetary policy normalisation, we expect inflation to decline in the coming years, but to remain above target in 2023 and 2024. The risks to the inflation outlook are primarily on the upside, mainly reflecting the possibility of further major disruptions to energy supplies. Sustained periods of high inflation - especially when combined with labour shortages - may increase the risk of excessive second-round effects, which may in turn lead to inflation remaining high for a prolonged period of time. The ECB closely monitors wage dynamics and long-term inflation expectations to assess such risks. Currently, wage growth remains contained, although it has increased somewhat. Long-term inflation expectations also remain anchored, but initial signs of above-target revisions in some indicators warrant close monitoring. The financial stability outlook has deteriorated as weaker economic growth, higher inflation and tighter financing conditions put pressure on the debt servicing capacity of companies and households. Despite recent adjustments, financial markets still appear to be pricing in outcomes that could turn out to be too optimistic. This makes valuations vulnerable to a range of possible negative surprises, whether from growth, inflation, monetary policy or corporate profitability. And although open-ended investment funds have slightly reduced their credit risk exposures, their low liquidity buffers imply that there is still a significant risk of these funds amplifying a market correction via forced selling. Vulnerabilities also remain elevated in property markets, where the potential for a price correction has increased. The euro area banking sector has sound capital levels and continues to benefit from the falling levels of non-performing loans we have been seeing since 2014. However, while bank profitability has so far been supported by higher interest margins and low impairments, the economic outlook makes future profitability very uncertain. We are seeing early signs of an increase in credit risk, which warrants careful monitoring. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has compounded the existing macro-financial vulnerabilities and increased the likelihood of risks materialising in the near term. In this challenging environment, macroprudential authorities in some countries could still increase capital buffers, provided that procyclical effects are avoided. This would preserve the banking sector's resilience and increase authorities' room for manoeuvre in the event of adverse developments. At the same time, authorities should take the current headwinds to economic growth into account and avoid an excessive tightening of credit conditions. It is also important to make further progress with global financial reforms. In particular, the resilience of the non-bank financial sector could be improved by enhancing the availability and use of liquidity management tools for open-ended investment funds and by better aligning redemption terms with asset liquidity via more structural liquidity tools. Further policy work on margining practices and non-bank leverage would also be important. Given the urgency of the current food crisis, we welcome the rapid approval of the new ""food shock window"" so resources can be provided to the affected countries as soon as possible. We also welcome the swift approval of the emergency financing for Ukraine under this new window. Furthermore, very good progress has been made as regards the IMF's new Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST), which has now become operational. For contributions by EU national central banks, it is essential that claims on the RST maintain reserve asset quality. In our assessment, the modalities of the loan and deposit accounts of the RST, as well as the deposit and investment account of the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust, are acceptable in that regard. However, we note that the channelling of special drawing rights by EU national central banks to multilateral development banks or individual countries would not be compatible with the EU's legal framework. The IMF's work on climate change is a positive step. Decarbonisation policies are expected to have manageable macroeconomic implications in the near term, if implemented gradually but without delay. However, further delays would worsen the trade-off between addressing inflation and safeguarding economic output, potentially also posing challenges for monetary policy. In the current environment of high energy prices and inflationary pressure, we should take advantage of the fact that the paths to achieving both energy security and climate security are pointing firmly in the same direction. The ECB will adjust the corporate bond holdings in the Eurosystem's monetary policy portfolios and collateral framework, introduce climate-related disclosure requirements and enhance risk management practices. This is all part of our action plan to incorporate climate change considerations into our monetary policy framework. Just this month, the Eurosystem started taking each issuer's climate score into account for all purchases of corporate bonds in the context of the ongoing reinvestment purchases. Tackling climate-related and environmental risks is also one of the ECB's key supervisory priorities for 2022-24. We have set a strategic objective for banks to proactively incorporate climate-related and environmental risks into their business strategies and their governance and risk management frameworks. As regards the digital economy, the ECB will continue to support and contribute to the G20 initiative to make international payments faster, cheaper, safer and more inclusive. This requires improvements in various areas, including the interoperability of payment systems and exchanging data across borders. And several legal issues need to be resolved, such as aligning cross-border regulatory, supervisory and oversight frameworks. We have also just entered the second year of the investigation phase of our digital euro project. We are examining key questions about the potential design and distribution of a digital euro, which would be a complement to cash, not a replacement for it. For the Eurosystem, the motivation behind the digital euro project is mainly domestic in nature. However, we recognise the benefits of discussing various issues at the international level, such as cross-currency payments made in retail central bank digital currency (CBDC) and the potential effects of giving foreign users access to domestic retail CBDC under specific conditions. In this regard, international cooperation on digital currencies will remain essential.","['inflationary', 'inflation', 'macroeconomic', 'pandemic', 'geopolitical']","['ensure inflation', 'global inflation', 'inflation safeguarding', 'addressing inflation', 'risks inflation']","['inflationary pressures worldwide', 'addressing inflation safeguarding', 'global inflation outlook', 'inflation outlook global', 'inflation safeguarding economic']","['global inflation outlook', 'inflationary pressures', 'monetary policy', 'inflation outlook', 'strong inflationary pressures']"
6136,r221015a_BOE,united kingdom,2022-10-15,Monetary policy and financial stability interventions in difficult times ,bailey,1,"We are meeting in the most difficult of times. And, in saying that, we should start by recognising that however difficult each of our positions is, that is nothing compared to the suffering inflicted on the people of Ukraine. In these times, a large measure of stoicism is called for, particularly the view of stoics that the best indication is what we do and how we behave, rather than what we say. But, there is an important role for communication, and so I will set out the key elements of UK monetary and financial stability policy as I see them. The UK economy has been buffeted by very large disturbances in the last two and a half years or so. Covid, the supply chain issues in the Covid recovery, a shrinkage of the labour force during this period, and most recently the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on energy and other commodity prices. These disturbances are very large. In the UK, the rise in energy prices means that household spending on energy as a share of income could plausibly be a full 2 percentage points higher this winter than in 2019. This is a bigger increase than we saw in the energy crises in the 1970s. The disturbances that have come since Covid hit have been supply side effects in the UK - supply chains, shrinkage of the labour force, cuts in the supply of natural gas to Europe as a whole. I want to draw out a number of points from this. First, the UK economy did not experience a rapid and sustained recovery from the Covid disturbance. The level of GDP on the latest reading remains below the pre-Covid level. The problem is that the supply side has shrunk, particularly the labour force, and the economy has been hit by a huge shock to national real income from the war. Second, it is said that central banks, including the Bank of England, were wrong a year or so ago to emphasise the transient nature of these shocks, and thus how monetary policy should respond. No and yes is my response to that. No, in the sense that the monetary policy prescription for how to respond to a single transient supply shock was the correct one. But, yes, because what we didn't see was a sequence of such shocks to come, without gaps, which invalidated the basis of the transient argument. The combined duration of these shocks has kept inflation elevated for an uncomfortably long period of time given the potential implications for medium-term inflation expectations. But, could we have predicted Russia's behaviour? Third, and I think harder, and where I am sure economic historians will find interesting issues to dissect: could we have foreseen the shrinkage of the labour force and the persistently low level of unemployment, despite the prevailing disturbances? I'm not going to judge this, but I will say that the two questions that weigh for me are: could we reasonably have foreseen at the time that the high level of inactivity in the labour force would persist beyond the pandemic; and should we have been more sanguine that the end of a furlough scheme, which covered one million jobs up to the end, would have no impact on unemployment? That's all history, but it shapes where we are today. Meanwhile, Russia perpetrated its illegal invasion of Ukraine, setting off the disturbance that has run through the world economy. For the UK, as I noted earlier, and for many other countries, it has been a huge negative shock to real income, to the position of households and businesses. It affects most severely the most vulnerable and least well off because energy, as a necessity of life, is a much larger part of their consumption. For us at the Bank of England, it has created a huge challenge for monetary policy. Inflation is well above its 2% target. In early August, we estimated that the direct effects of higher energy prices - that's not including indirect effects - would contribute around 6 1/2 percentage points to inflation towards the end of this year. Our assessment was that inflation would peak at around 13%, and then come down sharply - other things equal - to the 2% target in two years' time, before falling further to 0.8% in three years. Much of the discussion in the Monetary Policy Committee was around how equal other things really would be. To what extent would the tightness of the labour market exacerbate the impact of energy prices on inflation expectations, and thus cause higher inflation to be more persistent? Meanwhile, the impact of the energy price shock has, throughout Europe and beyond, posed a huge challenge for Governments and for fiscal policy. The consequences of the shock for people are huge and disturbing. Governments have naturally responded. The UK Government has introduced a two-year price cap for domestic household energy prices, and a six-month cap for businesses. This is a major intervention, but understandable. The consequences for monetary policy are important. It should cap the peak of inflation, we think at around 11%, and it should lead to a more rapid fall in inflation back towards target. And, other things ought to be more equal because there is greater confidence in the profile of retail energy prices during the period on which monetary policy focusses. But, it remains to be seen whether other things will be more equal - we can't take this for granted I'm afraid - we will have to keep a close eye on the situation. And, the price cap will add to demand relative to what it would have been without the cap, and thus what we thought in August. It will therefore add to inflationary pressures towards the later part of the two-year period on which we focus. This is the point at which we thought inflation would come down to, and then go below target. Lastly on this, we also have to think about what energy prices will be when the cap is lifted. More recently, the UK Government has made a number of fiscal announcements, and has set October 31 as the date for a further fiscal statement. The MPC will respond to all this news at its next meeting in just under three weeks from now. This is the correct sequence in my view. We will know the full scope of fiscal policy by then. But I will repeat what we have said already. We will not hesitate to raise interest rates to meet the inflation target. And, as things stand today, my best guess is that inflationary pressures will require a stronger response than we perhaps thought in August. UK financial markets have experienced some violent moves in the last few weeks particularly at the long-end of the Government debt market. This has put the spotlight on flaws in the strategy and structure of one important part of a lot of pension funds. The Bank of England has had to intervene to deal with a threat to the stability of the financial system, our other core objective. There may appear to be a tension here between tightening monetary policy as we must, including so-called Quantitative Tightening, and buying government debt to ease a critical threat to financial stability. This explains why we have been clear that our interventions are strictly temporary, and have been designed to do the minimum necessary. I want to end by drawing on this experience to make the distinction between monetary policy and financial stability interventions. As a central bank we have to be able to do both, and at any time. We cannot decline to do one because it appears to be at odds with the other. For me, the test is whether we can still operate each policy in accordance with its objectives, at all times. And the answer is yes. But let me elaborate on the difference between the two, with three important points. First, one of definition. Monetary policy should be seen as the active setting of interest rates, or more broadly influencing risk-free yields, in order to meet the inflation objective given prevailing economic conditions. Financial policy, meanwhile, has a broad sweep. In the context of our recent gilt market operations, it is aimed at preventing overall financial stability from being threatened by severe dislocations in some financial markets. It is not about steering market yields towards some particular level, but rather preventing them from being distorted by market dysfunction. This distinction may not always be as clear in practice as in principle. But on this occasion, I think it was. The jump in long-term yields in the hours before the Bank's intervention was accompanied by a sharp widening in bid-ask spreads. For shorter maturities, historically the more liquid part of the gilt market, both yields and spreads moved significantly less. We had a very clear message from market participants about the stability-threatening dynamics of this process. On that first day it only took a small number of purchases (PS1bn) to reduce the 30-year yield very significantly (-100bps). All this suggests that - whatever the fundamentals - the particular behaviour at the long end of the curve was caused by a liquidity event. Second, the operational details also differ significantly. The MPC's decisions on QE have targeted a specific stock of total asset holdings. But for financial stability purposes, we are not looking to buy any particular amount, or to cap or control yields. Our aim was to restore liquidity and to provide time for so-called liability-driven investment (LDI) funds to reduce leverage. Unlike QE, our financial stability operation was very much a short-term one. It ended yesterday after only two weeks of operation. Third, the MPC is not using the stock of asset holdings as an active tool of monetary policy at present. As we have made clear over a number of years, once Bank Rate was away from the lower bound, and could move in both directions, the intention was to unwind the stock of QE gradually and predictably, and in a way that wasn't bound to underlying economic conditions. Instead, monetary conditions are now steered by Bank Rate, the primary instrument of policy. Should monetary conditions prove too loose to meet the inflation target, given the economic news, it's Bank Rate that responds. And whatever the source of any disturbance to monetary conditions, the MPC is free to offset those disturbances by means of its primary instrument, Bank Rate. In these difficult times, we need to be very clear on this framework of intervention.

Contrary to Bitcoin or Ethereum, participating in governance is promotion-vote the possible options are 'Yea', 'Nay' or 'Pass'. A voting outlined in Section , this effect is mild. In addition, the selected outcome is checked once again at the last step. Pareto efficiency could be further hampered under the assumption that the proposals appearing in a single voting period are too many or too technical to evaluate in the allotted time, before the vote. on many proposals, either leading to a deadlock if no proposal reaches or favoring whales (i.e. users with many tokens).

4000,r221019a_BOJ,japan,2022-10-19,"Economic Activity, Prices, and Monetary Policy in Japan",adachi,0,"First, I would like to touch on developments regarding COVID-19. During summer 2022, a seventh wave of COVID-19 swept across Japan, and the number of confirmed new cases surpassed the previous peak (Chart 1). However, as the resumption of economic activity progressed while public health was being protected, people refrained from going out less than in past waves, due in part to the absence of pandemic-related restrictions during the seventh wave. Likewise, in overseas economies, the spread of COVID-19 cannot be said to have subsided, although it has been contained. Unless a highly virulent variant emerges, the economic impact of COVID-19 will likely become less significant even if another wave occurs. That said, China maintains its stance of strictly adhering to the zero-COVID policy. Lockdowns in its cities will continue to pose the risk of an adverse impact on the global economy through international supply chains. This is a risk factor to the global economy, and thus warrants attention. 2. Recent developments in economic activity at home and abroad I will now describe recent developments in economic activity both at home and abroad. Let me begin with the global economy. Despite being under downward pressure stemming from the spread of COVID-19, it has managed to recover and stay resilient without falling into a marked slowdown that had been of concern during the early stages of the pandemic (Chart 2). In my view, the following two global commonalities can be highlighted as the background to the global economy's resilience. The first factor is that, with the impact of COVID-19 waning, private consumption has been solid, due in part to pent-up demand -- that is, demand that was suppressed during the pandemic. While global inflation could be a factor pushing down consumption, so far there have been no signs of higher prices considerably reducing consumption through a decline in real disposable income. Behind this continued resilience in private consumption lie (1) sufficient income compensation measures taken by respective governments during the pandemic and (2) household savings that have accumulated as a consequence of the significant reduction in consumption opportunities for face-to-face services, due mainly to governments' implementation of pandemic-related restrictions. In addition, in the United States, for instance, higher prices of such assets as equities and homes have brought about increases in unrealized gains on household assets. This can be noted as a factor that has contributed to underpinning private consumption. The second factor is buoyant demand for business fixed investment. This is in reflection of an increase in investment intended to, for example, facilitate digital transformation (DX) and address climate change. Let me now take a look at Japan's economy from the viewpoint of the two commonalities I have just described. With respect to the first factor, or pent-up demand, this materialized after the sixth wave of COVID-19 seen at the beginning of 2022 abated, and in turn helped raise the economic growth rate. Subsequently, although such demand weakened somewhat during the seventh wave, it likely contributed to underpinning economic activity (Chart 3). As for the second factor, or demand for business fixed investment, the plans presented in various survey results suggest that there continue to be strong expectations that fixed investment will serve as a driving force for a virtuous cycle in Japan's economy. Mainly due to the effects of supply-side constraints associated with the pandemic, fixed investment continues to be lower than firms' initial plans; however, plans that have been postponed will likely be put into place in tandem with the waning impact of COVID-19 (Chart 4). I would now like to briefly touch on Japan's exports. With global business sentiment having been firm during the course of recovery from the pandemic, exports from Japan basically remain steady (Charts 5 and 6). However, imports have increased significantly due to a surge in prices of crude oil and other raw materials, and the balance on goods continues to register a deficit; currently, a worsening in terms of cross-country transactions when seen from the viewpoint of Japan's overall economy -- that is, deterioration in the terms of trade -- is causing an outflow of income from Japan. Japan's overall economy, despite being affected by factors such as a rise in commodity prices, seems to have picked up as the resumption of economic activity has progressed while public health has been protected from COVID-19. Let me now turn to Japan's price developments. The year-on-year rate of increase in the consumer price index (CPI) for August 2022 was 2.8 percent for all items less fresh food and 1.6 percent for all items less fresh food and energy (Chart 7). Given the announcement that prices of food and many other items will be raised this month, it has become more likely that the incoming year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI for October will reach 2 percent, which is set as the Bank of Japan's price stability target, even in terms of the rate for all items less fresh food and energy. Although Japan's inflation rate remains low compared with other countries, prices are currently rising at a faster pace than I have expected so far. One contributing factor to this higher inflation rate might be that firms' price-setting behavior could be starting to change (Chart 8). An increasing number of firms that had not been able to make price hikes in the past may have decided to raise prices, having confirmed that firms that had taken the lead in raising prices did not see a plunge in profits. Possible factors that have led firms to shift their price-setting behavior are pent-up demand and household savings that have accumulated as a result of pandemic-related restrictions, both of which I mentioned earlier, as well as wage increases for fiscal 2022. Next, I would like to talk about whether or not the aforementioned acceleration in inflation will be sustained. My view on prices is that they will continue to rise to a certain extent, but when questioned about whether I envision a path toward achieving the Bank's price stability target in a stable manner, I have to say that I still lack confidence in such achievement. In what follows, I will explain the reasons for my view while touching on the mechanism that lies behind inflation dynamics. The CPI consists of prices of a variety of items with varying price fluctuations. While there are various methods for analyzing the CPI, the one that focuses on the frequency of price changes in each item is useful. With this method, developments in prices can be decomposed into those of ""flexible CPI"" and ""sticky CPI"" -- with the former comprising items with relatively high frequency of price changes and vice versa for the latter. Broadly speaking, the flexible CPI is mainly composed of goods prices and the sticky CPI is mainly composed of services prices. Let me examine variation factors influencing the two aforementioned CPI categories based on the concept of the Phillips curve, which is frequently used in macroeconomic analysis. The flexible CPI is considered to be susceptible to the business cycle or the output gap, whereas the sticky CPI is deemed to be susceptible to medium- to long-term inflation expectations. That said, the flexible CPI also tends to be responsive to raw material prices that mainly reflect international commodity prices. The major contributors to the current rise in Japan's CPI are goods prices, which are susceptible to an increase in international raw material prices, such as energy-related items, food products, and durable goods. On the other hand, services prices, which mainly make up the sticky CPI, are seeing only marginal increases (Chart 9). With respect to inflation expectations -- a major factor influencing the sticky CPI -- the Bank's Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan) shows that, while firms' inflation outlook for one year ahead -- or that for the short term -- in particular has recently risen, increases in the outlooks for three years ahead and five years ahead -- or those for the medium to long term -- have been relatively moderate (Chart 10). Now, let me address the question: What factors are crucial for the Bank to achieve the price stability target in a stable manner? I personally place importance on developments in the sticky CPI. Just to avoid any misunderstanding, developments in the flexible CPI are also of importance. However, the flexible CPI is inevitably subject to upward and downward fluctuations caused by the business cycle. It is also strongly affected by energy price developments and other cost-push factors from abroad. Therefore, in terms of stable achievement of the price stability target, it is necessary that the sticky CPI provide an underpinning. In order for the sticky CPI to stay stable at a higher level, it is essential that medium- to long- term inflation expectations remain stable at an elevated level. To this end, it is imperative that wages increase in a sustained manner. Wage growth would likely contribute to pushing up services prices, which have so far seen only marginal increases. Ultimately, higher services prices would likely lead to a rise in the sticky CPI. Furthermore, it is vital that firms' growth expectations rise to facilitate wage increases. Unfortunately, however, it seems that many firms have not necessarily raised such expectations so far. This is suggested by the latest fiscal 2021 released by the Cabinet Office, which shows that the projected real economic growth rate for the next five years based on firms' responses is somewhat low, at 1.0 percent (Chart 11). For reference, before Japan slipped into prolonged deflation, the rate for the same period was at 2 to 3 percent or more. Taking into account the current situation of Japan's economy, which I have explained thus far, I consider at this point that it is still only halfway to achieving the Bank's 2 percent price stability target. Next, I would like to say a word about the Bank's conduct of monetary policy, including the views on risks that lie behind it and how it relates to foreign exchange rates. Faced with the recent price rises and yen depreciation, some have commented that the Bank ought to revise its monetary policy. The point I want to make is that such a move is premature. As I mentioned earlier, Japanese firms' growth expectations have yet to rise, and wages have not shown a conclusive sustained increase. Under these circumstances, prices are vulnerable to economic fluctuations accompanying adverse external demand shocks. Depending on the magnitude of the shocks, the risk of Japan slipping back into deflation cannot be ruled out. It is vital, therefore, to understand the views on risks that lie behind the Bank's conduct of monetary policy. My concern is that risks to economic activity are possibly becoming more skewed to the downside. As I will explain in a moment, there are downside risks with regard to the economies of major countries and regions such as the United States, Europe, and China, each of which could potentially have a significant impact on Japan's economy. Starting with China, as I mentioned at the outset, the strict zero-COVID policy remains in place. At present, business sentiment in the country is seeing an improving trend as the COVID-19 situation has calmed down and production has been resuming after a hiatus. However, should there be a resurgence of COVID-19, there is concern over the risk that reinstated lockdowns in China's major cities and other measures may push down the manufacturing of industrial products. Furthermore, the risk of adjustments in the Chinese real estate market causing adverse shocks to the economy is also a matter of concern. Until recently, I considered that the impact of such adjustments could be contained, particularly through government measures. However, I am now concerned that the risk posed by the real estate market might not end up being negligible, in light of the fact that the adjustments have caused economic losses to households that bought real estate and have triggered a slowdown in regional economies, where real estate investment has been driving ongoing rapid growth. In the event of intensified adjustments in the real estate market, the Chinese authorities will likely implement demand stimulus measures. However, the zero-COVID policy has had a considerably strong effect on curbing demand, and the effectiveness of any stimulus measures therefore could be seriously undermined. In this situation, the authorities might face extreme difficulties in terms of shaping their policy actions. Turning next to the United States, the country is currently experiencing its highest levels of inflation since the early 1980s. Looking at this in detail, the surge in energy prices has been a relatively minor contributor to the elevated inflation; rather, it is characterized by the sizable contribution of the rise in prices of goods and services, including housing costs, amid strong upward pressure on wages. The rate of increase in the sticky CPI that I mentioned earlier is accelerating further in the United States, and there is a risk that the inflation rate will remain elevated (Chart 12). There is also concern that the sticky CPI may become difficult to bring under control, if prices and wages start to spiral upward over a short period of time, thereby elevating medium- to long-term inflation expectations. The Federal Reserve is currently engaged in aggressive monetary tightening to dampen demand so as to minimize the risk that higher inflation expectations will become entrenched due to continued elevated inflation. Furthermore, in the United States, prices of such assets as equities and homes have risen, mainly against the background of expansionary fiscal policy and accommodative monetary policy measures conducted by authorities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the turn of this year, equity prices have been on a declining trend. If asset prices are adjusted in response to further monetary tightening, attention needs to be paid to the risk of the U.S. economy decelerating. Moreover, given the global interconnectedness of asset prices, the possibility of worldwide adjustments in such prices also warrants attention. Lastly, Europe, like the United States, is facing elevated inflation. Unlike the United States, however, such inflation is largely attributable to the impact of the surge in natural gas and other energy prices reflecting the situation surrounding Ukraine. That said, if a wage-price spiral takes place, this will likely cause a sizable increase in medium- to long-term inflation expectations and high inflation could become chronic. For this reason, the European Central Bank (ECB) has also been aggressively raising policy rates. In the meantime, the United Kingdom appears to be moving into a tough situation. On top of the surge in energy prices, it has encountered a grave labor shortage amid the pandemic, due in part to a decline in immigrants following Brexit. This has been accompanied by a surge in wages and is beginning to induce a wage-price spiral. Until lately, the Bank of England (BOE) was out ahead of the Federal Reserve in implementing aggressive monetary tightening. Yet, in late September 2022, the U.K. government announced a large-scale fiscal stimulus package featuring massive tax cuts, and this in turn engendered a sharp interest rate hike. Furthermore, even though monetary tightening has pushed up interest rates in the country, the British pound hit its lowest level against the U.S. dollar since the adoption of the floating exchange rate system. To address the market turmoil, the BOE is taking action to ensure financial stability by, for example, carrying out temporary purchases of long-dated U.K. government bonds and postponing the beginning of the planned gilt sale operations. Such market turmoil was largely unthinkable until quite recently; I now consider it necessary to keep a close eye on its impact, particularly on the U.K. economy and global financial and capital markets. As I have described, risks to the global financial and economic environment surrounding Japan have rapidly become skewed to the downside. Crude oil prices, which had seen a surge until lately, have recently shown signs of a decline (Chart 13). I believe that this most likely reflects concern over the risk of a slowdown in the global economy. History suggests that there is considerable risk in making a shift toward monetary tightening in such cases where the possibility of ""a storm landfall"" cannot be ignored. In the current situation where downside risks are significant, I believe that any move to revise the direction of monetary policy toward tightening should be considered with caution. Next, I will touch on foreign exchange rates. I am closely monitoring the effects of exchange rate movements on economic activity and prices. In light of these movements, let me share what approach I think monetary policy should take. First, monetary policy should focus on the underlying trend in inflation, aiming to keep it stable at around 2 percent. As I mentioned earlier, although prices are currently rising, the reality is that it remains uncertain whether the price stability target can be achieved in a stable and sustainable manner, as neither rises in firms' growth expectations nor sustained increases in wages can be seen conclusively. Second, exchange rates are not subject to direct control by monetary policy to begin with. They constitute a category of asset prices and could fluctuate significantly in the short term. If monetary policy responds to every single short-term fluctuation and puts off achieving the target for the underlying trend in inflation, this could increase uncertainty over the future conduct of monetary policy. Presumably, this is not desirable for Japan's economy in the long term. Third, as I noted a moment ago, risks to the global financial and economic environment have rapidly become skewed to the downside. I believe that there is considerable uncertainty about the effects that future global financial and economic developments will have on foreign exchange rates. So far, the core of my argument has been that now is not the time for monetary tightening in Let me go on to address the positive effects of the Bank's current monetary easing on the economy. Among these, there are three points in particular that I think are significant: (1) business performance of exporters, especially large firms, is trending upward, which could become a source of wage increases; (2) production sites that had been transferred offshore are beginning to return to Japan, which will help push up the potential growth rate; and (3) a decline in real interest rates will encourage the expansion of business fixed investment, thereby contributing to improvement in the output gap. By contrast, I think revising the direction of monetary policy toward tightening would have significant negative effects. Such a move could lead to a decline in demand for components susceptible to higher interest rates -- such as housing investment, business fixed investment, and consumption of durable goods -- and this might in turn have an adverse effect on households and the corporate sector, especially small and medium-sized firms. Cumulatively, such adverse effects would increase the likelihood of Japan falling back into deflation -- a risk that cannot be ignored. Given these considerations, I believe that the best course of action at this time is to maintain the accommodative monetary policy with a focus on achieving the 2 percent price stability target. I will close by noting the Bank's measures to facilitate corporate financing. The Bank decided at the Monetary Policy Meeting held in September 2022 that it would phase shift to fund-provisioning that would meet a wide range of financing needs. The operations have been targeted at supporting mainly small and medium-sized firms since April 2022. I would like to express my opinion on the factors behind the phasing out of the Special Operations to Facilitate Financing. To begin with, the impact of COVID-19 on economic activity is waning, and although the impact of the pandemic remains in some segments, the financial positions of small and medium-sized firms have been on an improving trend on the whole. Meanwhile, the number of bankruptcies has still been stable at a low level. In addition, demand for the special operations has declined. Acute crisis measures, such as said operations, appear to have almost finished their role. If crisis measures continue for longer than necessary, this could result in unexpected misallocation of resources in the overall economy. However, the impact of COVID-19 has not disappeared. Thus, it is appropriate for the Bank to maintain the availability of the special operations for the time being while phasing them out. Specifically, the Bank decided to extend the implementation period of the special operations for the fund-provisioning against loans for which financial institutions bear credit risk (""non- government-supported loans"") by six months and for the fund-provisioning against loans that financial institutions make on the back of government support (""government-supported loans"") by three months. At the same time, firms' financing needs are arising for various reasons, such as an increase in demand for working capital due to a surge in raw material prices. In response to this growing demand for funds, it is appropriate to increase the usability of the Bank's fund- provisioning measures. In this context, the Bank decided to remove the upper limit on the Funds-Supplying Operations against Pooled Collateral, which previously had been limited to a maximum of 2 trillion yen on a bi-weekly basis.

6138,r221020a_BOE,united kingdom,2022-10-20,The inflationary consequences of real shocks,broadbent,0,"Between them, the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine have inflicted significant damage on the UK's national income. Today I want to look at the link between these extraordinary shocks, the very high rates of inflation that have followed and the response of monetary policy. I will also draw one particular contrast with the potential response to easier fiscal policy. I'll kick off with the slightly less dramatic topic of national accounting identities. One of the first things you get taught in macro-economics is that national income is equal to national output: in principle GDP measures both these things, as well as aggregate demand. Accounting identities of this sort don't tell you anything about what causes what as they're true by definition (though it's useful to understand that we earn only what we produce and sell). But you might at least think, given the recovery in whole-economy output in the eighteen months since (Chart 1), that the worst of the drops in national income during the pandemic are well behind us. Chart 1: GDP just about back to pre-pandemic levels However, while the accounting equality of output and income is valid in nominal (i.e. cash) terms, and more generally in closed economies, it's not always the case in real terms and for open economies. When we're able to trade with other countries we no longer have to consume and produce the same things. This means output and consumer prices can diverge. And movements in that relative price will affect the real consumption value of what we collectively produce even if its quantity (GDP) doesn't change. If you produce apples but consume oranges you'll be better off when the price of oranges falls (relative to that of apples), worse off if the opposite happens. It's not that domestic output and productivity don't matter for income: obviously they do. But movements in relative prices matter too, and there are times when they matter a lot. In the real-world UK economy, one of the big differences in this respect involves energy and other physical goods. Collectively we consume a lot more of these things than we produce. The UK is a big net importer of (non-energy) goods. And although the North Sea is still providing quite a bit of oil and gas, here too the UK runs a significant deficit. Besides, only a very small minority of UK residents actually receive any disposable income from that source. Notionally ""British"" companies operating in the North Sea have significant foreign ownership. What domestic shareholdings do exist are likely to be held mostly in pension funds and other long-term (i.e. inaccessible) investment vehicles. This means that, for given GDP, rises in the relative prices of goods and energy make us collectively worse off. And that's exactly what's happened over the past couple of years, thanks first to the pandemic and then Russia's cut in gas exports. Over that period the price of the UK's imports has risen by 20% more than the average price of its output. You can see this in the last bar in Chart 2. Chart 2: Bucking the long-term trend, import prices have risen much faster than output prices over the past couple of years Last two years Change in import prices relative to GDP deflator, annual average, % points As a result, real income for the non-North Sea economy as a whole - how much our collective output is actually worth, in consumption terms - has fallen by over 5% since the Chart 3: Real income has therefore fallen steeply relative to output This may not be completely unprecedented but it's pretty unusual. As you can see from the earlier bars in Chart 2, the post-war trend has been the opposite: compared with that of aggregate output, the average price of goods - and therefore of UK imports in aggregate - has tended to decline . At times this has added significantly to real income growth. During the ""noughties"", for example, the integration of China into the global trading system depressed global goods prices markedly. This wasn't such a great thing if you were a manufacturer in the west, competing with this new source of production. Net buyers of goods, on the other hand, were made better off. Real household income outgrew GDP by a cumulative 7 % points during that decade. Clearly - and with a vengeance - the early part of this decade has seen a sharp reversal of these trends. In the third quarter of this year, UK GDP will probably be only slightly below where it was in the last quarter of 2019, immediately before the pandemic. Yet real household income is likely to be over 3% lower, with real corporate profits down by more It's understandable, faced with this extraordinary squeeze, that people and firms in the UK economy have sought to protect their real incomes - whether pay or profits - through compensating rises in wages and domestic prices. Unfortunately, and at least collectively, those efforts will not make us better off. It's not as if one group or sector is worse off only because another, within the (non-North Sea) UK, is better off. The rise in import costs has depressed the purchasing power of the country as a whole. So all that can be done is to shift the losses from one place to another. And in the process, without any lasting impact on real incomes, the result is simply higher growth of nominal pay and prices. These are the ""second-round effects"" (of higher import prices on domestic inflation) to which monetary policy is having to respond. Today, I want to make three points about this process. First, monetary policy cannot undo the hit to real income. Nor could it ever have done. One often hears that people are worse off ""because of inflation"". This is not quite right. Implicitly, it presumes that monetary policy could have prevented prices from rising so fast without doing anything to nominal incomes. Unfortunately, that's not the case. Even assuming policy had been tightened sufficiently aggressively, and sufficiently early, to have knocked eight percentage points off the current rate of inflation, it would also have depressed nominal income growth by at least as much and almost certainly quite a bit more. Unemployment would be materially higher and nominal wage growth materially lower. Ultimately, this reflects what is known as the ""neutrality"" of monetary policy: in the long run it has no impact on real economic variables (things like real output or relative prices). It can't boost structural productivity, for example. Nor can it offset the consequences for real incomes of (say) disruptions to supply chains in Asia or Russia's curtailment of the supply of gas to Europe. Indeed, in the first instance, at least for a period of time, tighter monetary policy lowers GDP and real incomes. I will say more about this shortly. For the time being, a better short-hand description is this: the pandemic and the war have led jointly to higher inflation and lower real incomes; the MPC will ensure the inflationary effects do not persist into the medium term; but the real-income hit exists either way, and will be reversed only to the extent the underlying shocks themselves go away. The second point I want to make is that we are inevitably having to learn, to some degree, about the scale of these ""second-round"" effects. The MPC has raised interest rates faster than at any time in its history but obviously more gradually than inflation itself. In the main, this is because the direct effects of the jumps in traded goods and energy prices, as violent as they are, are likely to fade before policy could really do much about them. The exact timing and scale of the peak rate of retail energy price inflation will obviously depend (amongst others) on the nature and duration of government support. But in the absence of further (and equally steep) rises in wholesale gas prices, and even without any such support, inflation in retail energy bills is likely to be materially lower a couple of years from now than it is today. Inflation in the areas most affected by the pandemic seems already to have peaked. However, it's also because we are relatively unfamiliar with the second-round effects of these things. They very clearly existed in the past, before inflation targeting was put in place in 1992. Economists long recognised that, in the presence of ""real income resistance"", negative shocks - from, say, higher import prices or higher taxes - could generate inflation in wages and domestic prices. Estimates of these effects using the historical data, from before the 1990s, were reasonably sizeable. But they then began to decline, a phenomenon many attributed to greater flexibility in the labour market. So although there were occasions after 1992 when real incomes were squeezed - the big rise in import prices immediately after the financial crisis was one obvious case, so too perhaps the period of weak productivity growth that followed - there was very little sign of any second-round response of domestic inflation. Absence of evidence is not the same as evidence of absence. Given the enormous scale of the rise in import prices it would have been surprising to see no impact whatever on domestic inflation, particularly against the backdrop of a very tight labour market. But it's unavoidable that we are having to learn about these effects, and to respond to them, as they emerge. Unlike the more volatile movements in tradable goods prices, shifts in domestic inflation tend to persist for longer and it will require a period of below-trend growth in demand to bring inflation back towards target-consistent rates. Because they've depressed real incomes, that slowing in demand will to some degree follow from the very same rises in import costs that have pushed up headline inflation. But monetary policy needs to be tightened as well. My third point is that the response to a pure demand shock - say from easier fiscal policy - is rather different in this respect. We can be less uncertain about its effects, there's less reason to wait till they actually come through and one would therefore expect a more immediate reaction. For as long as it's in place, the government's Energy Price Guarantee has the effect of limiting headline inflation and, to that extent, any related strengthening of second-round (and more persistent) effects on domestic inflation. By the same token, however, it mitigates the severity of the hit to household incomes and thereby supports domestic demand. As the Committee noted last month, this would - all else equal - add to inflation in the medium term. And, compared with the forecast we had in August, the MPC has judged that the second effect is likely to outweigh the first. There is uncertainty about the nature and duration of these subsidies. The government has now said the current scheme will now last only six months, rather than two years, but that some form of support is likely to be provided thereafter (albeit on a more targeted basis). The MPC will take account of any fiscal news in the forthcoming Medium-Term Fiscal Plan, as well as any other news relevant for the medium-term inflation outlook, in its next set of forecasts. Anyhow, having laid out already the main points I want to make, the rest of the talk fills in some of the details. I'll start with a discussion of monetary ""neutrality"", explaining why policy cannot in the long run offset the income effects of real economic shocks, including those from the pandemic and the war. I'll then go over briefly the historical evidence about ""second-round effects"", putting the current experience into context. The final section covers the potential response to the recent fiscal announcements. I'll also touch briefly on the very marked rise in the expected path of interest rates, beyond the MPC's next meeting, priced into financial markets. If you open an A-level economics textbook one of the first things you'll see is something like Chart 4. The ""AS"" (aggregate supply) lines trace out the response of output and prices to a change in aggregate demand (represented by a shift in the ""AD"" line), for example from a change in the stance of monetary policy. Chart 4: Monetary policy only affects real variables for a while In the short run the supply curve is upward sloping (""SRAS""), so stronger demand can raise output as well as prices. This is more or less the relationship that A.W. Phillips had uncovered, using pre-WWI British data, in his 1958 paper . But students are also taught that, over time, once prices adjust in full, there is no effect of monetary expansions on real output. The long-run Phillips curve - here labelled an aggregate supply (""LRAS"") relationship - is vertical. The idea that money is ""neutral"" - that it has no enduring impact on real output or incomes - goes all the way back to David Hume, in the mid-18 century. It also makes intuitive sense, I think. Most people would instinctively understand that one cannot permanently enrich a country simply by dolling out more banknotes. In the end, all that would do is to raise all prices and wages equiproportionately and nothing real would be affected. As far as the theory is concerned, this is pretty much guaranteed in any formal description of the economy as long as (i) people are assumed to care about real not nominal things - what their wages can actually buy, not just what they're worth in pounds or dollars - and (ii) prices are ultimately flexible. But for a while, in the immediate aftermath of Phillips's paper, the point was temporarily forgotten. His eponymous curve was commonly interpreted as some unchanging, structural relationship, one that seemed to offer a long-run choice between controlling inflation and boosting real activity and incomes. If a country was prepared to tolerate a slightly higher rate of inflation it could (on this view) generate a permanent rise in its real income. It was Milton Friedman, in his famous 1968 presidential address to the American , who brought people back to earth. It was true, he said, that monetary expansions could boost activity and employment for a while. But this effect relied on people mistaking nominal for real wage increases and therefore couldn't last. ""There is a temporary trade-off between unemployment and inflation; there is no permanent tradeoff"". Friedman's main concern was to point out the fruitlessness (not to say danger) of asking the monetary authority to target or ""peg"" some arbitrary rate of economic growth or the level of unemployment. These are real things that cannot ultimately be affected by monetary policy: ""The monetary authority controls nominal quantities...and can use this control to peg [another] nominal quantity - the exchange rate, the rate of inflation, the rate of growth of nominal national income. It cannot use [monetary policy] to peg a real quantity - the real rate of interest, the rate of unemployment, the level...or growth rate of real national income"". For our purposes, the important implication of this conclusion is that if something else shifts those ""real quantities"" monetary policy cannot offset it. The picture in Chart 5 is one (very high-level) way of representing this ""dichotomy"" between real and nominal things. The left-hand column divides the original, underlying drivers of the economy in two, the right-hand side does the same for economic outcomes. Solid lines represent long-run, permanent effects, dotted lines temporary ones. The key point is that the long-run channels run purely horizontally: over time, monetary shocks (including from monetary policy) can only affect nominal outcomes; enduring changes in real things - productivity, real incomes, any relative price - can only have been caused by real disturbances . Chart 5: In the long run, real things are unaffected by nominal shocks The fact that the relative price of energy has gone up so steeply in Europe has a real cause: Russia's curtailment of the supply of gas. The same goes for the steep rises in prices of non-energy goods that came before, during the course of 2021. Because it prompted a shift in consumer spending towards goods, while at the same time impairing their supply, the pandemic pushed up the relative prices of things like computers and cars. As we saw in the introduction the result of these shocks has been a steep rise in the price of what the UK consumes relative to what it produces. That inevitably depresses real incomes, regardless of the path of monetary policy and overall inflation. This is why I think it's misleading to say that real incomes have fallen ""because of inflation"". The phrase ""cost of living crisis"" is closer to the truth. Closer still is this: the war and pandemic have directly and inescapably depressed real incomes; they have also, for a time, raised domestic inflation; the MPC will ensure the phenomenon is temporary; but the real-income consequences of these shocks exist either way (unless and until they're Having discussed the real consequences of these big shocks I'll now say a word about their nominal effects (the higher of the two dotted lines in Chart 5). How is it that a rise in import prices can create upward pressure on domestic inflation and what do we know about the scale of these ""second-round effects""? This has been a critical judgement for monetary policy. Prices of tradable goods are volatile and their direct contribution to overall inflation tends not to last that long - a shorter time, in particular, than it takes for monetary policy to have a significant effect of its own on inflation. The classic example is a change in oil prices. The direct effects on the CPI, most directly on petrol prices, come through quite quickly. Equally (and unless the price of oil keeps rising) that also means they drop out of the annual rate of inflation after a year or so. That's too short a time for monetary policy to have much effect. Prices of other, non-energy traded goods aren't quite as volatile, their direct effects take longer to feed through and therefore affect the overall rate of inflation for longer. But they're still unlikely to have that much of an impact a couple of years ahead, the sort of timescales it takes monetary policy to have its peak effects. So although the pandemic was clearly much less disinflationary than central banks and other forecasters had predicted - the demand-shifting and supply-impairing effects on goods prices were very significant - it nonetheless seemed likely at the time that these effects would dissipate, along with the virus itself, within that medium-term horizon. I think there are some signs this has begun to happen. One of the higher-profile effects of the pandemic was a dramatic rise in the cost of shipping. Also well reported were the steep rises in prices and delivery times for computer chips and the cars on which they rely. In all three cases rates of inflation have fallen back markedly over the past few months Chart 6a: Shipping costs have fallen steeply in recent months Chart 6b: Inflation in prices of cars and computers has also turned out to be transitory However, there was always the risk that big rises in traded goods prices might prompt faster inflation in its more persistent, domestic components, including nominal wages. This would have a bigger impact on forecasts of inflation at policy-relevant horizons and clearly merit a response. In gauging the potential strength of these ""second-round effects"", how much did we have to go on? Not much, is the answer. As we saw earlier, import (and therefore consumer) prices have risen much faster than those of output. It's this widening dislocation that has depressed real incomes. One way to measure the strength of ""second-round effects"" is to ask how changes in the ""wedge"" between output and consumer prices affect near-term nominal wage growth. Are external hits to real income absorbed relatively quiescently, without much of an effect on domestic inflation? Or is there sufficient resistance that people want to claw back in higher nominal pay what they've lost from higher import This was something that received quite a bit of attention from labour market economists during the 1980s and 1990s. It was clear then that external influences on real incomes - from changes in import prices or taxes - could have significant second-round effects. Using data from 1956-85, the economists Layard, Nickell and Jackman estimated that a 1% hit to real incomes pushed up near-term nominal wage growth by somewhere between Annual inflation; per cent Second-hand cars . The rapid response of pay growth to the big hike in VAT in 1979 was one example. Over time, however - and above all during the inflation targeting period - this sensitivity seemed to decline. Chart 7 plots rolling estimates of this coefficient over the past thirty years. According to these, nominal pay growth during the inflation targeting era has become increasingly desensitised to shifts in the wedge between consumer and output prices. There were periods when it might have responded. After the financial crisis, sterling fell, pushing up the cost of imports, and productivity growth declined. Yet there was almost no perceptible response of nominal pay and domestic prices. Economists attributed this decline either to the change in monetary regime itself, or - more often - to greater flexibility in the labour market. Chart 7: Lower sensitivity of wages to real income shocks during inflation targeting period But it was hard to be confident about these estimates. Labour-market flexibility isn't set in stone. In a speech in 2006 , Charlie Bean suggested that increased ease of migration, in both directions, might have reduced the sensitivity of real wages to shifts in labour demand. It's possible that, by adding a degree of friction to the inflow and outflow of migrant workers, the combination of Brexit and the pandemic have made the labour market less adaptable than it was a few years ago. There may be other reasons why susceptibility to second-round effects can vary. During the one period in which higher import prices seriously impinged on real incomes, following the financial crisis, unemployment was also much higher than it is today. Perhaps this deterred employees from seeking compensating rises in nominal pay (perhaps, in other words, the response to a given hit to real incomes depends on the degree of slack in the labour market and the wider economy). Those post-crisis years aside, there simply wasn't much evidence on which to draw from the inflation-targeting era. That's why the estimates in Chart 7 are relatively unstable. The fact is that we've never really seen anything like the hits to real income the economy has had to endure over the past couple of years. And absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence. This uncertainty about the potential scale of second-round effects has some bearing on how monetary authorities, including the MPC, have responded to this surge in inflation. There's long been a debate about how quickly policy should react to news about the economy. Should interest rates be adjusted immediately to a level that's likely to be appropriate for some time? If so, one wouldn't expect to have to make any further changes at the following few meetings (in the absence of any incoming news that alters the outlook). Or should they respond to inflationary news only by degrees, in which case there's a natural upward slope to the near-term path of interest rates? Even having tightened policy at one meeting, there would need to be negative news about the outlook not to do so again at the following one. In the data, there does appear to be a degree of ""smoothness"" in the way official interest rates behave. Rather than jumping from one level to another, factoring in all the news at once, the policy rate usually seems to respond to it over time. Two explanations have often been suggested. One is uncertainty about the impact of changes in official interest rates. If there's a degree of imprecision in estimates of policy multipliers there's a case for moving a little more gingerly than otherwise. Another, offered by the economist Michael Woodford, is that smoothing the spot interest rate gives the central bank better control of medium-term interest rates, which may matter more in the transmission of policy. In this case I think a third factor may be at play, namely the need to learn about the extent of these ""second-round effects"". We have inevitably had to learn about them and, therefore, to respond to signs of more persistent domestic inflation as and when they emerge. This is less the case when it comes to plain-vanilla shifts in aggregate demand. These are more common and the appropriate response is well understood: an inflation-targeting monetary authority has to lean against them. Indeed, one additional reason for caution, in the face of these big rises in import prices and their impact on domestic inflation, has been the likelihood that they will also weigh significantly on domestic demand. Employing again the simple AD/AS framework, their initial impact may have resembled a leftward shift in supply (Chart 8a) - but in time these hits to real income also take their toll on demand, shifting the AD line to the left as well (Chart 8b). Charts 8a and 8b: The shocks hitting the UK have pushed up inflation and started to weigh on demand That hasn't happened to any appreciable extent so far. Households emerged from the pandemic with extremely high rates of saving: having been so suppressed during the lockdowns, consumer spending had ample room to bounce back when they were lifted (even without any subsequent growth in income). Those high saving rates had resulted in the accumulation of significant ""excess deposits"": measured relative to household incomes, they were around 15% higher than before the pandemic (Chart 9). Wider measures of households' financial wealth had also recovered strongly, along with global equity markets, and those too were comfortably above average. All this provided the support for a very steep decline in the rate of saving (i.e. for consumption to grow much faster than income) once the economy came out of the lockdowns. financial wealth is down sharply But to varying degrees these cushions have since been eroded. The saving rate has fallen sharply and is now around a percentage point below its long-term, pre-Covid average. Most of the excess deposits remain, it seems. But one might ask why they do - why, at a time of significant reported pressure on household finances (when consumer confidence has been setting new record lows), more of them haven't been spent - and therefore whether it's realistic to think that they will be in the near future. As many have pointed out, these deposits are probably skewed towards the upper end of the income distribution (and therefore away from those for whom rises in energy prices are the most burdensome). It's also worth recognising that other household assets have been weakening sharply this year. Despite higher deposits, households' overall net financial wealth is quite a bit lower than before the pandemic. It fell sharply during the first half of this year (relative to income) and is likely to have fallen further since then (the dot at the end of Chart 9 is an estimate of the position at the end of Q3, based on recent moves in asset prices). All this suggests that, if household spending has been unusually independent of income since the pandemic, that is less likely to be the case from now on. The correlation with income is likely to be re-established. And it therefore mattered quite a lot, for the MPC's projections in August, that households were set to experience further steep rises in their energy bills. Given the path of wholesale gas prices implied by financial markets at the time, OFGEM's price cap was set to rise (in the central forecast) by over 3% of household income by next spring. Households' real disposable income was projected to decline by 2 1/2 %, with consumer spending down by over 1%. This reduced inflationary pressure in the medium term, helping to pull inflation below target towards the end of the three-year Household financial wealth relative to disposable income forecast period. (I say ""helping"" because other things mattered too, not least the further rise in Bank Rate, to a peak of around 3%, then priced into financial markets.) It therefore mattered too that the new government then launched its Energy Price Guarantee, forestalling the rise in energy bills. For as long as the scheme's in place this will temper any further rise in headline inflation, and with it any related increase in ""second-round"" effects over the medium term. However, by relieving some of the immediate pressure on household finances, the policy would also add significantly to domestic spending over the next year (relative to our last forecast). At the margin, the task of reducing overall demand growth, in order to bring inflation back to target, would therefore tilt more towards monetary policy. And as I argued earlier, there's less reason to respond to this news in a ""gradual"" or ""smoothed"" manner. Whether or not that response needs to be as large as the shift in market interest rates, since our last set of forecasts, remains to be seen. For one thing, there is now some uncertainty about the prospective scale and nature of the government's energy subsidies. On Monday the Chancellor said the Energy Price Guarantee would be maintained only for six months, rather than the two-year period originally planned. He suggested support was likely to continue, beyond six months, albeit in a more targeted fashion. But we are unlikely to know for a while precisely the form that will take. Second, the rise in market interest rates has been very dramatic. At the time of the Monetary Policy Report in August, prices in financial markets were consistent with Bank Rate rising to a peak of 3% next spring and then falling back a little over the following year. Despite a decline in recent days, that expected peak is now around 5 1/4 %. This is by some distance the largest rise in market interest rates between MPC forecasts since the Committee was founded. By way of comparison, Chart 10 plots this increase in market interest rates against one particular, simple representation of how interest rates might have had to respond to a couple of key developments since August: the decline in sterling's exchange rate and the original, two-year version of the Energy Price Cap. Both would tend to raise medium-term inflation, for any given level of interest rates, and would therefore tend to merit an additional response from policy (all else equal). This is expressed in Chart 10 as the the Committee is shown these OPPs to inform its policy judgement. The provides more background on the OPPs. Chart 10: Market interest rates have risen dramatically since the August MPR One should always take the OPPs with a healthy dose of salt. They are based on a particular characterisation of the MPC's objectives. (We ask a simple policymaking ""bot"" to stabilise inflation and output, placing four times more weight on the first than the second, and to pay some heed too to the ""smoothness"" of interest rates). The resulting path obviously depends on the extent to which interest rates are assumed to affect demand and inflation. The higher the policy multipliers the smaller the ""optimal"" response of interest rates is likely to be. It's also conditional on - and therefore highly sensitive to - the particular forecast on which it's based. Any observer - indeed any individual MPC member - who sees the risks differently from those in the central projection will come to a different conclusion about the most likely path of future interest rates. Furthermore, as regards the comparison in Chart 10, the Energy Price Cap and the currency have not been the only pieces of news since August that might have influenced market expectations. For example, forward interest rates rose a cumulative 50bp on the (nine) days on which UK price and wage data were released. The market may also be wary about further changes in fiscal policy, and to take a skewed view of the risks in that respect. Yield curve news energy package and sterling depreciation Percentage points Nevertheless, the graph does serve to illustrate quite how significant the moves in markets have been in the past couple of months or so. If Bank Rate really were to reach 5 1/4 %, given reasonable policy multipliers, the cumulative impact on GDP of the entire hiking cycle would be just under 5% - of which only around one quarter has already come Chart 11: Most of the impact of cumulative tightening implied by market prices yet to come One often hears that real incomes are lowe","['gdp', 'monetary', 'economy', 'fiscal', 'inflation']","['uk gdp', 'national output', 'uk economy', 'monetary shocks', 'economy output']","['nominal national income', 'shocks including monetary', 'uk national income', 'monetary shocks including', 'income shocks inflation']","['uk gdp', 'nominal national income', 'national output', 'uk economy', 'monetary shocks']"
7688,r221020a_FOMC,united states,2022-10-20,Welcoming Remarks,bowman,0,"Welcome, and thank you for joining us to discuss topics important to the nation's economy. This research seminar is part of the Federal Reserve's series of events called ""Toward Today's seminar, hosted by the Board of Governors, will focus on how the COVID-19 pandemic affected educational outcomes and the subsequent impact we anticipate for transitions to the labor force. We have invited accomplished researchers to discuss their work--and what practical lessons might be drawn from it--that could help inform community development practice and public policy considerations. As I am sure you are aware, the pandemic created significant disruptions for our students and the education system. At the onset of the pandemic, steps taken to slow the spread of COVID-19 resulted in widespread closures of businesses and schools. Many, myself included, were immediately concerned about the negative effects on education from changes that included shifting to virtual instruction, lack of access to technology, and changes to the accessibility and provision of childcare. It is critical to consider that access to education at every step along a student's learning path serves as a pipeline into the labor force and enables future generations of Americans to participate and thrive in our dynamic labor market. The disruption of education throughout the pandemic undoubtedly led to an absence of workers in the labor force, creating a shortage that held back the early economic recovery. Education outcomes, including learning losses and achievements, take time to measure, aggregate, and analyze. As we enter the fourth academic year affected by the pandemic, data on student performance are becoming more available. Much of this early data confirms our initial concerns. For example, early test scores show that throughout the country nine-year-olds suffered a decline in learning outcomes during the pandemic. But other data also indicate that learning losses were unequal and disproportionately affected low-performing students and low- income students. It is likely that the sudden shift to online classes contributed to the learning declines. SHED), only 22 percent of parents with children attending virtual classes agreed that their children learned as much as they would have attending classes in person at school. I hope that the return to in-person learning and reopening of schools will enable children to resume normal learning and that academic achievement will rebound. It seems that even with this return to in-person attendance, many schools are struggling to provide students with the same quality of education as they did pre-pandemic. With the return to onsite education, many schools are confronting challenges that impair their ability to meet the educational needs of students. A number of educators appear to have left the profession, as indicated by the nearly 100,000 more job openings for teachers in July 2022 than before the pandemic. Complicating these issues, across the country the return to in-person instruction has been met by an increase in chronic absenteeism, which is defined as a student missing at least 10 percent of school days in a school year. Compared to a typical school year pre-pandemic, 72 percent of U.S. public schools reported an increase in chronic absenteeism among their students during the 2021-22 school year, which is a 39 percent increase over the previous year. Missed school typically means missed learning, so chronic absenteeism is a key metric of school performance. It's likely that these challenges will result in lower graduation rates and possibly less stable employment than would have otherwise been the case. These outcomes raise difficult questions about how to best respond to the needs of students and educators going forward. For example, how can curricula be adjusted to meet students where they are today, after nearly three years of pandemic-impacted learning? How can we best re-engage the larger proportion of students who may have become disconnected as a result of these pandemic-related disruptions to their education? What does this all mean for the future of the labor force? In addition to the challenges facing primary and secondary education, higher education was not immune to pandemic disruptions. Like K-12 education, studies show that online instruction reduced the academic performance of college students. In addition, we have seen declines in both college enrollment and the rate of first-year college students who continue their education into a second year. These declines are most pronounced at community colleges and open-access programs. Some of this decline was due to a supply-induced shortage resulting from colleges unable to offer remote learning options for many technical and vocational programs. The reduction in these ""hands-on"" programs, such as air-conditioning repair and auto detailing, had a greater impact on male enrollment and may lead to labor supply shortages for some of these skills-based professions. Education is the greatest and most effective input into the future of our labor market. In order to have the strongest possible labor force in the future, it is critical to understand and act immediately to address the educational losses experienced during the pandemic. I'm sure there's much to learn about how these education challenges, both longstanding and more recent, will ultimately affect the job market. That's a question of particular interest to policymakers, and it's one of the most important reasons that we host events like this seminar. I look forward to hearing from the experts we have invited here today to discuss ideas to successfully and quickly address academic declines, expand K-12 education options, improve higher education outcomes, and prepare this generation to participate and thrive in the future labor force. I hope that the research presented today is useful to you in your work. Community development professionals in our audience may consider how the design and implementation of their services can be enhanced. And researchers may encounter ideas that spark new work that can shed further light on these important topics. Thank you so much for joining us.","['education', 'educators', 'students', 'pandemic', 'educational']","['education pandemic', 'disruptions education', 'education changes', 'affected educational', 'educators going']","['disruption education pandemic', 'pandemic affected educational', 'education onset pandemic', 'education pandemic undoubtedly', 'pandemic impacted learning']","['education outcomes', 'pandemic disruptions', 'educational losses', 'educational outcomes', 'educational needs']"
899,r221026a_BOC,canada,2022-10-26,Monetary Policy Report Press Conference Opening Statement,macklem,1,"Governor of the Bank of Canada Press conference following the release of the Good morning. I'm pleased to be here with Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Rogers to discuss today's policy announcement and the Bank's Today, we raised the policy interest rate by 50 basis points to 3.75%. This is the sixth consecutive increase since March. Quantitative tightening continues and is complementing increases in the policy rate. We also expect our policy rate will need to rise further. How much further will depend on how monetary policy is working to slow demand, how supply challenges are resolving and how inflation and inflation expectations are responding to this tightening cycle. Our decision today reflected several considerations. First, inflation in Canada remains high and broad-based. Inflation has come down in recent months, but we have yet to see a generalized decline in price pressures. Second, and related, the economy is still in excess demand--it's overheated. Households and businesses want to buy more goods and services than the economy can produce, and this is driving prices higher. Third, higher interest rates are beginning to weigh on growth. This is increasingly evident in interest-rate-sensitive parts of the economy, like housing and spending on big-ticket items. But the effects of higher rates will take time to spread through the economy. Fourth, there are no easy outs to restoring price stability. We need the economy to slow down to rebalance demand and supply and relieve price pressures. We expect growth will stall in the next few quarters--in other words, growth will be close to zero. But once we get through this slowdown, growth will pick up, our economy will grow solidly, and the benefits of low and predictable inflation will be restored. Finally, we are trying to balance the risks of under- and over-tightening. If we don't do enough, Canadians will continue to endure the hardship of high inflation. And they will come to expect persistently high inflation, which will require much higher interest rates and potentially a severe recession to control inflation. Nobody wants that. If we do too much, we could slow the economy more than needed. And we know that has harmful consequences for people's ability to service their debts, for their jobs and for their businesses. This tightening phase will draw to a close. We are getting closer, but we are not there yet. We are carefully assessing the effects of higher interest rates on economic activity and inflation. And we are being clear with Canadians and focusing on the job we have been assigned--to restore price stability for the benefit of all. Let me expand on these considerations and highlight the key points in the The Governing Council began by assessing international developments since the July MPR. Inflation around the world is high and increasingly broad-based. With most central banks raising their policy rates to control inflation, global financial conditions have tightened rapidly. The global economy is slowing, and we revised down our projection for global growth. We also noted the emergence of financial stresses in some markets in recent months. A number of indicators suggest that global supply disruptions are easing. Oil and other commodity prices have also come down since July. Together with slower global growth, these developments suggest global inflation should come down over time. However, uncertainty is high, particularly related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and there is potential for more volatility in energy markets and for renewed supply chain disruptions. Turning to Canadian developments, the Governing Council devoted considerable attention to assessing inflation, inflation expectations and the balance between demand and supply in the economy. welcome, most of that decline reflects a drop in gasoline prices. Inflation in Canada is broad-based, reflecting large increases in both goods and services prices. About two-thirds of the components of the consumer price index (CPI) have risen by more than 5% over the last year. And rising prices for essentials like groceries and rent are hitting lower income Canadians particularly hard. Because short-term movements in total CPI inflation are often dominated by swings in volatile international prices like oil prices, we are watching measures of core inflation closely for signs that price pressures in Canada are easing. Our preferred core measures have stopped rising in the last couple of months, but they have yet to show clear evidence that underlying inflation is coming down. Looking ahead, there are some early encouraging signs. Businesses have said they expect the rate of price increases for the goods and services they sell will come down. And more timely 3-month rates of core inflation have declined, although they are still averaging about 4%. We will need to see these 3-month rates come down further, and those declines be sustained. We are also looking for evidence that near-term inflation expectations are easing and that longer-term expectations are centred on our 2% target. Near-term expectations remain high and our surveys suggest that uncertainty about where inflation is headed remains unusually elevated. Looking at indicators of labour markets and economic activity, it is clear that even though the economy has started to slow, it remains in excess demand. Job vacancies have declined from their peak but remain high, and businesses continue to report widespread labour shortages. With the economy now fully reopened, households want to enjoy many of the close-contact services they have missed, but businesses can't keep up, and we have seen prices for services rise rapidly. Higher policy interest rates are beginning to slow demand. Higher mortgage rates have contributed to a sharp slowing in housing activity from unsustainable levels, and consumer and business spending on goods is moderating. This has led to declines in house prices and is exerting downward pressure on goods prices. Moving forward, we expect the effects of higher interest rates to continue to work through the economy, moderating household spending and business investment. Slowing global growth, particularly in the United States, will also weigh on Canadian exports. We project growth in gross domestic product (GDP) will stall through the end of this year and the first half of 2023 before picking up in the second half. Annual average GDP growth is therefore projected to decline from about 3 1/4 % this year to just under 1% next year and about 2% in 2024. With growth below potential for several quarters, excess demand in the economy dissipates and the economy moves into excess supply in 2023. Putting the global and Canadian outlooks together, we expect inflation will hover around 7% in the final quarter of this year, fall to around 3% by the end of next year and return to the 2% target by the end of 2024. The Bank of Canada's job is to ensure inflation is low, stable and predictable. We are still far from that goal. We view the risks around our forecast for inflation to be reasonably balanced, but with inflation so far above our target, we are particularly concerned about the upside risks. We are mindful that adjusting to higher interest rates is difficult for many Canadians. Many households have significant debt loads, and higher interest rates add to their burden. We don't want this transition to be more difficult than it has to be. But we remain focused on our mandate. Higher interest rates in the short term will bring inflation down in the long term. And getting through this difficult phase will get us back to price stability with sustained growth. As we move forward, we will be watching carefully to assess the impact of higher rates on spending and how this is feeding through to price pressures. We will also be watching to see how global supply disruptions resolve and to what extent this translates into lower inflation in Canada. Finally, we'll be watching inflation expectations closely to assess how households and businesses are responding to slowing growth and spending. With that summary, Senior Deputy Governor Rogers and I are now pleased to take your questions.","['inflation', 'easing', 'monetary', 'recession', 'demand']","['inflation canada', 'canada easing', 'monetary policy', 'lower inflation', 'control inflation']","['lower inflation canada', 'considerations inflation canada', 'inflation canada finally', 'prices inflation canada', 'pressures canada easing']","['monetary policy', 'lower inflation', 'higher policy interest rates', 'underlying inflation', 'high inflation']"

900,r221101a_BOC,canada,2022-11-01,"Opening Statement before the Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and the Economy",macklem,1,"Governor of the Bank of Canada and the Economy Good evening. I'm pleased to be here with Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Rogers to discuss our recent policy announcement and the Bank of Canada's Last week, we raised the policy interest rate by 50 basis points to 3.75%. This is the sixth consecutive increase since March. Quantitative tightening continues and is complementing increases in the policy rate. We also expect our policy rate will need to rise further. How much further will depend on how monetary policy is working to slow demand, how supply challenges are resolving and how inflation and inflation expectations are responding to this tightening cycle. Our decision last week reflected several considerations. First, inflation in Canada remains high and broad-based, reflecting large increases in both goods and services prices. Inflation has come down in recent months, but we have yet to see a generalized decline in price pressures. About two-thirds of the components of the consumer price index (CPI) have risen by more than 5% over the last year. And rising prices for essentials like groceries and rent are hitting lower-income Canadians particularly hard. Second, and related, the economy is still in excess demand--it's overheated. Job vacancies have declined from their peak but remain high, and businesses continue to report widespread labour shortages. With the economy now fully reopened, households want to enjoy many of the close-contact services they have missed, but businesses can't keep up, and we have seen prices for services rise rapidly. Third, higher interest rates are beginning to weigh on growth. This is increasingly evident in interest-rate-sensitive parts of the economy, like housing and spending on big-ticket items. But the effects of higher rates will take time to spread through the economy. Fourth, there are no easy outs to restoring price stability. We need the economy to slow down to rebalance demand and supply and relieve price pressures. We expect growth will stall in the next few quarters--in other words, growth will be close to zero. But once we get through this slowdown, growth will pick up, our economy will grow solidly, and the benefits of low and predictable inflation will be restored. To put this in numbers, growth in gross domestic product (GDP) is projected to decline from about 3 1/4 % this year to just under 1% next year and then rise to 2% in 2024. And inflation is expected to hover around 7% in the final quarter of this year, fall to around 3% by the end of next year and return to the 2% target by the end of Finally, we are trying to balance the risks of under- and over-tightening. If we don't do enough, Canadians will continue to endure the hardship of high inflation. And they will come to expect persistently high inflation, which will require much higher interest rates and, potentially, a severe recession to control inflation. Nobody wants that. If we do too much, we could slow the economy more than needed. And we know that has harmful consequences for people's ability to service their debts, for their jobs and for their businesses. This tightening phase will draw to a close. We are getting closer, but we are not there yet. The Bank of Canada's job is to ensure inflation is low, stable and predictable. We are still far from that goal. We view the risks around our forecast for inflation to be reasonably balanced. But with inflation so far above our target, we are particularly concerned about the upside risks. We are mindful that adjusting to higher interest rates is difficult for many Canadians. Many households have significant debt loads, and higher interest rates add to their burden. We don't want this transition to be more difficult than it has to be. But higher interest rates in the short term will bring inflation down in the long term. Canadians are looking for ways to protect themselves from rising prices, and we are working to protect them from entrenched inflation. It will take time to get back to solid growth with low inflation. But we will get there. By working through this difficult phase, we will get back to price stability with sustained economic growth, which benefits everyone. With that summary, Senior Deputy Governor Rogers and I are now pleased to take your questions.","['inflation', 'recession', 'demand', 'monetary', 'cpi']","['inflation canada', 'canada economy', 'monetary policy', 'control inflation', 'inflation working']","['considerations inflation canada', 'inflation canada remains', 'bank canada economy', 'canada economy good', 'monetary policy working']","['monetary policy', 'entrenched inflation', 'high inflation', 'inflation', 'predictable inflation']"
282,r221101a_BOA,australia,2022-11-01,        Remarks at the Reserve Bank Board Dinner,lowe,1,"Good evening. On behalf of the Reserve Bank Board, I would like to warmly welcome you to this community dinner. This is the first time the Board has met outside Sydney since October 2019. We are delighted that we are able to do so in this beautiful and historic city of Hobart. It's a great pleasure to be back here. Thank you very much for joining us this evening. Earlier today, the Board held its meeting in the Cabinet Meeting Room here in Hobart. I would like to thank the Premier very much for his hospitality. Your Cabinet Room was an ideal place for the Board to discuss the state of the Australian and global economies and decide upon the level of interest rates in Australia. As you are probably aware by now, the Board decided to increase the cash rate by a further one-quarter of a percentage point to 2.85 per cent. I will talk about the reasons for this in a moment. The previous time that the Reserve Bank Board met in Hobart was back in April 2016. The economy was in a very different position then from where it is today. Inflation was below target and surprising on the downside, wages growth was very slow, the unemployment rate was close to 6 per cent and interest rates were trending lower, with the cash rate then at 2 per cent. The global economy was growing a bit slowly, but it was broadly okay. How much things can change in just a few short years. A couple of weeks ago, I was in Washington DC with the Australian Treasurer at the G20 and IMF meetings. It was a sobering experience. We heard that: inflation globally is way too high; the rising cost of living is hurting many households; the world is falling behind on the agreed carbon reduction targets; war is once again tragically occurring in Europe; and the global economy is becoming more fragmented. As you can imagine, there was not much cheer around, even for somebody like myself who sees the glass as half full. I recount this, though, for a couple of reasons. The first is as a reminder of how difficult the global backdrop is at present. There is no escaping the fact that we are living through a challenging period. It's true that the choices that we make here in Australia during this period will help shape our own destiny, but we can't ignore the global environment. The second reason is that as I listened to my colleagues from around the world, my thoughts kept returning to the idea of how fortunate we are to live in Australia. We live in peace and we enjoy a level of material prosperity that few other people in the world experience. Our economy has bounced back better than most from the COVID-19 disruptions and we are benefiting from a surge in the prices of our key exports. And for the first time in almost 50 years, it is possible to say that almost all Australians who want a job can find one. Our public services are of a generally high quality and our public finances are in better shape than those of many other countries. And our natural assets mean that Australia is well positioned for the clean energy transition. We have a lot to be thankful for. None of this is to deny that we face some pretty serious challenges, but as I listened to the finance ministers and central bank governors in Washington DC, I kept thinking I wouldn't want to trade our place for anybody else's. Today, the Board heard how the Tasmanian economy too has bounced back well from the COVID disruptions. Gross state product per capita has grown a bit more quickly here than in the other states and the unemployment rate is the lowest in many years. Visitor numbers are recovering and investment is in an upswing, with Tasmania set to play an important role in Australia's energy transition. On the other side of the ledger, though, household budgets are under strain from cost-of-living pressures, the rental market is very tight and many firms are finding it hard to find workers. Even so, it is important to remember that we are in a better position than many others around the world. One challenge that is facing all Australians is high inflation. Over the year to September, the inflation rate was 7.3 per cent. This is the highest rate in more than three decades and we are expecting inflation to increase further to reach around 8 per cent later this year. After that, inflation is expected to moderate. This is due to the ongoing resolution of supply-side problems, a decline in commodity prices and higher interest rates which will establish a better balance between supply and demand in the economy. I would like to take the opportunity to assure you that the Board is resolute in its determination to return inflation to the 2 to 3 per cent target range. We will do what is necessary to achieve that. At our meeting today we discussed the damage that high inflation does to people; it is a scourge. High inflation devalues your savings. It worsens inequality in our society and it undermines our living standards. It hurts us all by impairing the functioning of our economy. It is for these reasons that the Reserve Bank Board will make sure that this episode of high inflation is only temporary. I understand that the higher interest rates that are needed to bring inflation under control are unwelcome by many people, especially those who have borrowed large amounts over recent times. At our meeting, we discussed how the higher interest rates are putting pressure on family budgets, just at the time that high petrol prices and grocery bills are also squeezing budgets. We are conscious of this and are certainly taking it into account. This morning, we also discussed the consequences of not raising interest rates, and allowing high inflation to persist and become entrenched in expectations. If this were to happen, the evil of inflation would be with us for longer and the eventual increase in interest rates needed to bring it down would be greater. This would increase the risk of a severe recession and a sharp rise in unemployment. It would be much better to avoid such a costly outcome and so we have acted strongly to avoid it. I want to acknowledge, though, that we are travelling along a narrow path here. The Board is seeking to return inflation to the 2 to 3 per cent range while at the same time keeping the economy on an even keel. It is still possible to do this, but there is a lot of uncertainty and we could be knocked off that narrow path, not least because of developments elsewhere in the world. At our meeting we also discussed an updated set of economic forecasts. Our central case is that we do stay on that narrow path. Economic growth, though, is expected to slow next year because of the deterioration in the global economy and the squeeze on household finances. Our central forecast is that the unemployment rate holds steady for a while at what is a historically very low level, but then increases a bit as the economy slows. Inflation is expected to start declining early next year and then take a couple of years to return to the 2 to 3 per cent range. In the short term, the east coast floods are adding to the upwards pressure on food prices, and next year there are likely to be very large increases in the prices that households pay for gas and electricity. To control inflation, the Board has already increased interest rates substantially. We moved in large half percentage point increments for four months, but at this and the previous meeting, we returned to more standard quarter percentage point increases. The earlier large increases were required to move interest rates quickly away from their pandemic levels to address the rapidly emerging inflation problem. But as interest rates moved back to more normal levels, the Board judged that it is appropriate to move at a slower pace while we assessed the data, the economic outlook and the impact of the rate rises to date. We are conscious that interest rates have been increased by a large amount in a very short period of time and that higher interest rates affect the economy with a lag. If we are to stay on that narrow path, we need to strike the right balance between doing too much and too little. The Board's base case remains that interest rates will need to go higher still to bring inflation back to target and our forecasts have been prepared on that basis. We are not on a pre-set path, though. If we need to step up to larger increases again to secure the return of inflation to target, we will do that. Similarly, if the situation requires us to hold steady for a while, we will do that. Given the uncertainties regarding the outlook, we will be watching very carefully how the economy and the inflation pressures evolve over the summer. Finally, while it is interest rates that keep the Reserve Bank in the news, I hope that you know that we do a lot more than just set interest rates. We are the banker to the Australian Government, so we process all social security payments, tax payments and Medicare refunds. We also operate the core of Australia's payments system. When you send money from your bank to another bank it goes through the Reserve Bank. We also operate a central part of Australia's 24/7 realtime payments system. I hope that you all have a PayID, so that you can take best advantage of this technology. If you don't have one, I encourage you to go get one. We also print Australia's banknotes. It comes as a surprise to many people just how many banknotes are in circulation. The total value of notes on issue is over $100 billion - that's around $4,000 per person in Australia. This is despite cash being used less and less for transactions. Our analysis is that most of these banknotes are being held as a store of value. On average, there are 18 $100 notes and 38 $50 notes on issue for every person in Australia. I don't have my share of these or know many people who do. As interest rates have risen recently, I thought that the attractiveness of holding banknotes as a store of value might decline, but there is little sign of that yet. Time will tell, though. The Reserve Bank is also responsible for the design of Australia's banknotes. Given this, we are currently considering the design of the $5 banknote following the passing of Queen Elizabeth II. We recognise that this is an issue that is of national interest and there is a long tradition of the monarch being on Australia's banknotes. Indeed, the monarch has been on at least one of Australia's banknotes since 1923 and was on all our notes until 1953. Given this tradition and the national significance of the issue, the Bank is consulting with the Australian Government regarding whether or not the new $5 banknote should include a portrait of King Charles III. We will make a decision after this consultation with the government is complete. Again, thank you very much for joining us this evening. We are looking forward to learning more from you over dinner about how things are going here in Tasmania.","['hobart', 'rates', 'banknote', 'inflation', 'bank']","['rates australia', 'australia banknotes', 'rates reserve', 'tasmanian economy', 'cash rate']","['rates banker australian', 'australians high inflation', 'finally rates reserve', 'rates reserve bank', 'australia banknotes given']","['interest rates', 'higher interest rates', 'tasmanian economy', 'cash rate', 'reserve bank board']"
901,r221102a_BOC,canada,2022-11-02,Preparing for payments supervision,morrow,0,"Good morning, and thank you for inviting me to attend this year's Canadian Innovation Exchange Summit. This is an exciting event for entrepreneurs, investors and service providers who are on the cutting edge of technology innovation in Canada. Today I want to talk about how the Bank of Canada's evolving role in payments is keeping up with fast-paced advancements in how everyone pays for goods and services. Exchanging payment for these goods and services--like so much else in society--is moving more and more toward the digital universe. Consumers' use of cash at the point of sale decreased to about 22% in 2021--down from 54% in The COVID-19 pandemic has also led to greater use of debit and credit cards. About 85% of merchants now accept these electronic forms of payments, up from 60% in 2018. All that to say the payments ecosystem in Canada is evolving rapidly, with a sharp uptick in the use of mobile and digital payments. The fintech industry-- which includes a large number of payment service providers (PSPs)--has facilitated this evolution. And this industry is growing quickly--both in terms of the number of companies involved and the amount of capital invested. As the Notorious B.I.G. so aptly said: it's like the more money we come across, the more problems we see. There are new ways to pay and an abundance of new players in payments. When money changes hands electronically in these  new and different ways, we all need to make sure that consumers and the payments ecosystem are protected. So, where does the Bank of Canada fit into all of this? Well, Canadians place their trust in these PSPs every day when they tap their card to make a purchase, send money electronically to friends or family, or click the check-out button with their favourite merchant online. And under the , which was passed last summer, the government has mandated the Bank to supervise these PSPs. This legislation will safeguard the trust that Canadians place in PSPs. The Act establishes a new supervisory framework to ensure that PSPs are managing certain risks that could affect their users. The impetus behind all of this is to build confidence in the safety and reliability of payment services. Let's dig a bit deeper into what this means when the rubber hits the road. Before we get to the how and when, let's talk about the who. I'm sure there are fintech companies in the room today that may be wondering if the new framework will apply to them. Simply put, if you're in the business of helping people and companies make dayto-day payments, or store or transfer their money through electronic means, then your organization could very well be deemed a PSP that will fall under this new framework. This includes payment processers, digital wallets, money transferers and others. Banks and credit unions are already subject to a high degree of supervision at the federal and provincial levels, so they fall outside the scope of the Act. But we currently estimate there are over 2,500 entities that will come under our regulatory supervision. This includes well-established domestic and global entities that are household names when it comes to payments. It also includes a whole suite of newly established fintech companies. Domestic and foreign PSPs will be required to register with us. And we will maintain a public list of all PSPs that have signed up as well as a list of those whose registration has been refused or revoked. This is all to help us better monitor PSPs' ongoing compliance with the Act. This framework will apply to many entities, but we're not going to use a blanket supervisory approach to the task at hand. We will establish a common baseline of supervision for all PSPs, but we recognize that companies will have different business structures and operational processes. That's why we will take a risk-based approach that will focus on end-user impacts and the efficiency of payment services. Essentially, this means that both the level  of supervisory attention and the supervisory actions we take will be guided by the level of risk each PSP brings to consumers and the payments ecosystem. As a result, there is no ""one size fits all"" methodology. Moreover, PSPs can meet our expectations using many approaches. Our job is to make the objective very clear. And then PSPs can focus on reaching the destination, not necessarily following a prescriptive journey to get there. Of course, with this flexible risk-based approach comes a need to ensure industry participants truly understand their obligations. We will clearly lay out the requirements and expectations so that PSPs can adapt. The Act and forthcoming regulations will establish the mechanics of the new framework. But to truly make sure that industry players understand what's expected of them, we will supplement these documents with supervisory guidance. It's important that we promote understanding and compliance within the PSP community to make sure this Act does what it was designed to do. Equally important is everyone's understanding of the consequences of non-compliance. Under the Act, we have the power to take action if a PSP does not comply with the Act or its regulations. This starts with a compliance agreement that lays out the terms by which the PSP must rectify its operations. The next level of enforcement is a notice of violation. When we issue a notice of violation, we will publish on our website the company's name and the nature of its violations. The notice may also include a monetary penalty, which will be made public and could be as high as $10 million for a very serious violation. Finally, the Governor has the power to issue a compliance order if a PSP is committing--or is about to commit--an act that would have a significant adverse impact on consumers and other end users. Furthermore, if a situation of noncompliance becomes severe, we can pursue court enforcement, requiring the service provider to comply with the Act or an order. Now, I've talked about the new powers and responsibilities the legislation provides us. I think it's also important to be clear about some areas that remain outside our purview. We will not be supervising all aspects of risk. For example, we will require PSPs to ensure that end users' funds can and will be returned to them if a PSP becomes insolvent. Our supervision will not, however, prevent a PSP's failure or insolvency from happening in the first place. As well, customer complaints regarding fees charged by PSPs or other issues related to the fair treatment of customers are beyond the scope of our supervision. I want to be clear that our approach to supervision will change and evolve. We need to be forward-looking to assess emerging risks and practices in retail payment activities--and to keep up with the spirit of innovation that is driving changes in how Canadians pay for goods and services.  continues to guide the path forward. The committee was established in 2020 to provide us with industry expertise. The insights we're gaining from the PSPs on this committee are shaping our advice to the Department of Finance Canada regarding the forthcoming regulations. We're also engaging with industry groups, individual PSPs and associations that represent them and raising awareness of the framework more broadly. The Bank has also started outreach efforts through trade shows that we know PSPs will attend. In due course, when the draft regulations are published online, this will open the door to a formal comment process. This will give PSPs the chance to provide feedback about the new requirements. After the subsequent publication of the final regulations, we'll begin to publish our supervisory guidance. We will continue to seek feedback; it's important that we take the time to ensure we're doing this right, from the outset. In a similar vein, the Act is expected to come into force in stages. For example, PSPs will be required to register with us before they have to comply with requirements for operational risk management and safeguarding end-user funds. With these steps in mind, we expect to require payment service providers to register with the Bank starting in 2024. The initial pilot and subsequent launch of our risk monitoring and compliance work is currently scheduled for 2025. To meet this schedule, next year we will focus on finalizing the regulations and publishing our regulatory guidance. I'd like to stress that these are our current assumptions. Ultimately, the federal government will decide how and when each provision of the Act will come into force. I'm going to wrap up now, so we have time for questions. Before I open up the floor, I want to reinforce to everyone here that our goal in all of this is to support the innovation we see in the payments ecosystem while ensuring PSPs are managing their operational risks and ensuring their consumers' funds are protected.  By ensuring these key risks are well managed, we will further build and maintain Canadians' confidence that mo' ways of paying do not, in fact, create mo' problems. I'd like to thank you for your time and attention today, and I'd be happy to answer any questions you may have.","['banks', 'bank', 'fintech', 'payments', 'payment']","['payments fintech', 'bank canada', 'finance canada', 'digital payments', 'innovation payments']","['bank canada evolving', 'payments ecosystem canada', 'payments fintech industry', 'does bank canada', 'digital payments fintech']","['finance canada', 'digital payments', 'payment service providers', 'payments ecosystem', 'payment services']"
3245,r221103a_ECB,euro area,2022-11-03,Mind the step: calibrating monetary policy in a volatile environment,panetta,0,"The euro area is facing a sequence of unprecedented supply shocks resulting from the pandemic and Russia's aggression against Ukraine. These shocks have compounded each other and caused the current spike in inflation. Price pressures have broadened as firms have sought to pass higher costs on to consumers as the economy reopened. As a result, the ECB has accelerated the adjustment of monetary policy to keep inflation expectations anchored at levels consistent with its target. Across the last three Governing Council meetings, we have increased our interest rates by 200 basis points. This is the fastest rate hike in the ECB's history. Looking ahead, the medium-term inflation outlook presents clear upside risks in a general context of extraordinary uncertainty about the future evolution of the European economy. Today I will argue that, at present, the of monetary policy is clear. A further policy adjustment is warranted in order to keep inflation expectations anchored and stave off second-round effects. However, the of our stance should not rely on a one-sided view of risks - especially as we continue normalising our monetary policy in a highly uncertain economic environment. And it should remain focused on medium-term inflationary developments . We need to bring inflation back to our 2% target as soon as possible, but not sooner. We might otherwise create unintended effects, achieving little reduction of inflation in the short term, but causing excessive market volatility and a protracted economic slowdown beyond what is necessary to stabilise inflation in the medium term. Implementing the correct calibration of monetary policy will be challenging. We will need to carefully consider the resilience of our economy, the implications of global monetary spillovers, and emerging threats to financial stability. In the current situation, the direction of our monetary policy is clear. Inflation in the euro area is too high and will remain above our target for an extended period. Headline inflation reached 10.7% in October. Core inflation is around 5%. Monetary policy normalisation is necessary when repeated supply shocks drive inflation higher for longer. It signals that the central bank will not tolerate a de-anchoring of inflation expectations, reducing the likelihood of such a de-anchoring occurring. And it guards against the risk that monetary policy could exacerbate inflationary pressures by stimulating demand. But while the direction of the adjustment is clear, its calibration is not and its end point depends on the evolving medium-term economic and inflation outlook. The neutral interest rate provides limited guidance here. It is an asymptotic concept that describes the point when interest rates are neither accommodative nor contractionary in a situation where growth is around potential, inflation is not far from target and no transitory shocks are disrupting the inflation path. But that is not the world in which we find ourselves. Moreover, the neutral rate is unobservable. As I have argued elsewhere, estimates of the neutral rate are imprecise and widely dispersed. They are subject to considerable uncertainty in a post-pandemic world that has undergone structural change. Today, I find it more helpful to discuss the target-consistent terminal rate. This is the level of the policy rate that - if reached at the end of a short normalisation phase and then held constant - stabilises inflation at target by the end of the policy-relevant horizon in the absence of new shocks. I prefer the concept of the target-consistent rate to that of the neutral rate because it emphasises that we can gear our policy to a clear state-contingent reference in order to bring inflation back to target within a clearly defined period. Eurosystem staff regularly calculate estimates of the target-consistent terminal rate, which are an input into the preparation of our monetary policy meetings. But let me stress that these estimates are conditional on the economic and inflation outlook. They need to be continually reassessed in the light of incoming information. Specifically, we need to navigate a complex set of risks to medium-term inflation. On the upside, we could face the emergence of what I have called ""ugly"" inflation. This arises when above-target inflation de-anchors expectations, causing excessive wage and price-setting dynamics that eventually fuel further inflation increases (the second-round effects). At present, this risk is mostly driven by high energy prices and their pass-through to prices of other items. Annual energy inflation is running at around 42%. Energy has been the main contributor to headline inflation for the past 18 months (Chart 1). Higher energy input costs have contributed to extraordinarily high food inflation. They have been a key driver of goods and services inflation (Chart 2). And by dragging down the trade balance and weighing on the economic outlook, they are contributing to the depreciation of the euro, further reinforcing inflationary pressures (Chart 3). Contributions of components of euro area headline HICP inflation (annual percentage changes and percentage points contributions) Contributions of energy-sensitive components to goods and services inflation in the euro area (annual percentage changes and percentage point contributions) Notes: The term ""energy-sensitive component"" reflects items with a share of energy in direct costs above the average share of energy across services items (left-hand panel) and non-energy industrial goods (NEIG) items (right-hand panel).

Identification via sign and narrative restrictions, using daily data. The latest observation is for 24 October 2022. So far, inflation expectations have remained anchored and the risk of an incipient wage-price spiral in the euro area has been contained. Nominal negotiated wage growth has ticked up recently but is still far from compensating for the drop in real incomes caused by higher inflation. And the outlook for wage growth and unit labour costs remains consistent with our target overall. But we need to remain extremely vigilant in view of prolonged high inflation, which increases the likelihood of a pass-through to wage growth , especially as labour markets are now tighter than before the pandemic. But other forces may increasingly push in the opposite direction and contain the risk of second-round effects, as what I have dubbed ""bad"" inflation - the inflation resulting from supply shocks - compresses real incomes. The reduction in real wages and purchasing power is weakening domestic demand, with several leading indicators already pointing to a likely contraction in economic activity, starting from the last quarter of this year. The euro area PMI composite output index fell in October to its lowest level since November 2020, with forward-looking indicators of activity particularly weak. Consumer confidence plummeted to historical lows. And financial and credit indicators also point to significant downside risks to GDP growth (Chart 4). Downside risks to euro area real GDP growth (quarter-on-quarter change in percentage points) Notes: For each horizon, the chart shows the median of estimates of the lower quantile (10th percentile) forecast across the suite of ""GDP-at-risk"" models maintained by ECB staff, as well as the interquartile range to account for model uncertainty. These estimates are predicated mainly on developments in financial conditions, credit, risk, and the macroeconomy. Forecasts are conditional on financial data up to mid-October 2022 and real economy indicators up to the end of September 2022. These forces pushing on the downside might be reduced if supply bottlenecks continue to ease (Chart 5) and energy commodity and electricity prices continue to fall from their highs (Chart 6). But this would then also improve the inflation outlook and reduce the likelihood of ""ugly"" inflation taking hold. Easing of supply chain bottlenecks Notes: The Global Supply Shortages Index measures how many selected items have been in short supply against their long-run average for each month. The long-run average refers to value 1 of the index. The shaded minimum-maximum range refers to the 5th-95th percentile range across 20 items (e.g. chemicals, electrical items, packaging, steel and textiles). The latest observation are for September 2022 and October 2022 (Flash PMI estimates for the United Kingdom and the euro area). Spot prices of oil, gas, coal and electricity To sum up, the implementation of monetary policy presents us with a difficult trade-off. On the one hand, our need to ensure that inflation expectations remain anchored speaks for targeting the upper part of the range of estimates of the target-consistent terminal rate. And this range would move higher if upside risks to medium-term inflation materialised. But, on the other hand, in setting the monetary policy response we need to keep basing our decisions on the latest evidence and factor in downside risks to the economic outlook. In recent months, the public debate has stressed the risks of doing too little to curb inflation, since this would require a more painful future adjustment. But this should not make us underappreciate the risk of doing too much. First, we should bear in mind that it takes time before the full impact of our measures is felt in the economy. Moreover, monetary policy is transmitted to different variables with different lags. It immediately affects market expectations and financial market conditions through bond yields, equity prices and exchange rates. Since we started normalising monetary policy at the end of 2021, the one-year forward real rates have moved significantly higher across the entire term structure (Chart 7) and the one-year forward real rate one year ahead is now in positive territory. Likewise, nominal and real ten-year rates have increased by around 300 and 250 basis points respectively (Chart 8) . Change in euro area forward real interest rates Notes: Real forward rates are calculated by subtracting the inflation-linked swap forward rates from the nominal overnight index swap forward rates for each maturity. The latest observation is for 20 October 2022. Ten-year real, nominal and inflation-linked swap rates for the euro area Crucially, however, it takes longer for our decisions to be transmitted to the real economy through changes in lending conditions and, subsequently, demand and prices. The debate should thus not be distorted by an excessive focus on short-run inflationary developments, which cannot be controlled by monetary policy. The full impact of our measures will likely reach the economy when activity and inflation are already on a declining path. This implies that our tightening will need to end when inflation is still above our target. Second, we need to factor in global monetary policy spillovers when defining the domestic stance. With central banks across advanced economies adjusting their policies simultaneously (Chart 9), they could accentuate each other's policy impacts if they do not sufficiently factor in the feedback loop they create. ECB analysis finds that a tightening by the Federal Reserve System generates spillovers to euro area real activity and inflation that are comparable to its effects on the US economy. Financial conditions indices in advanced economies and emerging market economies Notes: National financial conditions indices are aggregated using GDP purchasing power parity shares. The latest observations are for 6 October 2022. It is sometimes argued that domestic inflation having a large global component should mean that domestic monetary policy needs to be tightened more forcefully to compensate for this weakened grip on prices. But if central banks across advanced economies are simultaneously tightening monetary policy - as is the case today - the opposite is true. If central banks do not fully factor in the effects of other central banks' policies, the current phase of global adjustment may give way to a more severe slowdown than anticipated. In recent decades, episodes of highly synchronised global monetary policy tightening have been associated with subsequent global recessions (Chart 10). Inflation surges, tightening synchronisation and global recessions Notes: The global ""inflation surges"" index (red dashed line) shows the share of countries which, at time t, are simultaneously experiencing: (1) year-on-year inflation that is higher than at time t-1; and (2) year-on-year inflation that is above a certain threshold. In this case, the threshold is given by the average of the year-on-year inflation in the post-Volcker period, from the first quarter of 1984 to the second quarter of 2022. The global ""tightening synchronisation"" index (blue solid line) is constructed using BIS data on the policy rates set by central banks and shows the share of countries which are tightening at time t. Global recessions are periods when: (1) annual growth of global GDP per capita is negative or close to zero; and (2) a high share of countries are in a technical recession. The latest observations are for the second quarter of 2022. Such a scenario could have particularly negative implications for the euro area. Our economy is not only more vulnerable than others to the energy crisis, it is also more open than economies such as the United States, China and Japan, and thus more exposed to a global recession. And because it is less flexible than the US economy, reversing course may be more difficult if demand and production weaken too much. Incorrectly calibrating our monetary policy could also have unintended effects for financial stability and the transmission of our monetary policy. The highly uncertain outlook has increased the sensitivity of market rates to new developments and shifts in risk sentiment. In turn, higher rates are exacerbating risk aversion, exposing the vulnerabilities of certain highly leveraged segments - such as residential property markets - and some types of non-bank financial intermediaries . These segments are vulnerable to adverse loops, with falling prices and rising rates feeding into higher debt refinancing costs, especially as falling real incomes make those costs less affordable. This market volatility is being compounded by global financial spillovers (Chart 11). These come mainly from the United States , but were also visible in the reaction of euro-denominated yields to the recent episode of market repricing in the United Kingdom. Global component in yields Correlation of sovereign bond yields in advanced economies, expectations components and term premia Notes: The sample consists of ten advanced economies (Australia, Canada, Denmark, euro area, Japan, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom and United States). The bilateral correlation coefficients are averaged across these countries and time periods. The term premia and expectations components are the average of estimates from three models (dynamic Nelson-Siegel, rotated dynamic Nelson-Siegel and dynamic Svensson-Soderlind). The latest observations are for 21 October 2022 (daily data). In the euro area, an additional source of volatility is the risk of financial fragmentation along national lines, which can impair the homogenous transmission of monetary policy throughout the euro area. The current environment therefore requires us to be prudent in adjusting our monetary policy across all instruments. There are three key considerations here. First, our decisions and communication on the pace of normalisation should avoid amplifying market volatility. There is a case for frontloading our policy adjustment given the need to keep expectations anchored, especially in view of the very accommodative stance from which normalisation started. But such frontloading should remain commensurate to the benefits and risks it creates. When it comes to managing inflation expectations, ECB staff analysis finds that the benefits of surprising markets with bigger-than-expected rate increases is limited in the euro area. And if these bigger-than-expected increases are interpreted as signalling a higher terminal rate, rather than simply frontloading the normalisation, we could have a stronger impact on financing conditions - and ultimately on economic activity - than intended. Additionally, a bigger-than-expected rate increase may heighten volatility and have a stronger impact in the current highly leveraged environment after a decade of very low rates and ample liquidity. So when calibrating our stance, we need to pay close attention to ensuring that we do not amplify the risk of a protracted recession or trigger market dislocation. Second, we must be clear about the sequencing of the normalisation process. We should avoid ""cliff effects"", continually monitor the market response to our measures and consider the feedback between our different instruments. Currently, our policy rate remains a suitable marginal instrument of normalisation. It is the instrument we know best. We have a comparatively limited understanding of the effects of reducing the size of our balance sheet. The size of our balance sheet will be significantly reduced as targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs) mature and banks likely make early repayments after the decision we took last week to adapt the TLTROs' terms and conditions to the current monetary policy context. We should take the necessary time to assess the impact of our rate hikes and of phasing out the TLTROs. As we normalise our monetary policy, we should expect bank lending conditions to tighten. What we need to avoid, though, is a sudden stop in the supply of credit to the broad economy. We should ensure that TLTRO repayments have been absorbed before we stop fully reinvesting the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under our purchase programmes. And when considering how we would then reduce the size of our bond portfolios, a controlled reduction - whereby only redemptions above a cap are not rolled over - is preferable to active sales, which may unsettle markets in an already volatile financial environment. Third, we must ensure the smooth transmission of our stance as we normalise monetary policy. Maintaining ample liquidity in the system will help ensure smooth money market functioning. This will allow us to continue tightly steering money markets through changes in our deposit facility rate. But preserving smooth transmission also means being ready to intervene in a timely manner to counter unwarranted market dysfunctions, should they arise. Our reinvestment flexibility under the pandemic emergency purchase programme - alongside the availability of the Transmission Protection Instrument, if required - protects the transmission of our monetary policy to all parts of the euro area, allowing us to set the appropriate stance. Recent months have shown that a credible ex ante commitment helps to establish a good market equilibrium, where higher yields do not drive spreads to higher levels that are disconnected from fundamentals. We also need to stand ready to address collateral issues. Collateral scarcity has recently impaired the pass-through of our policy rates to repo rates. The change in TLTRO III conditions should help alleviate tensions in the repo market , but we will continue to monitor the situation closely. As recently seen in other economies, an inconsistent policy mix can prove destabilising. So a successful normalisation process requires other policies to be consistent with monetary policy. For instance, well-designed energy and fiscal policies can make a key contribution to dampening short-term inflationary pressures, thereby helping to keep inflation expectations anchored and reducing the amount of monetary tightening necessary. To take a concrete example, the measures that have been taken to find alternatives to Russian gas, reduce gas demand and refill gas storage are likely playing an important role in bringing down gas prices. Likewise, joint initiatives at European level, common purchases and the redistribution of surplus energy sector profits can mitigate the impact of supply disruptions on energy prices. At the same time, energy policies should preserve price incentives and support energy efficiency. Fiscal policies should aim to cushion the impact on the most exposed and fragile households and firms, while not hindering the necessary trend reduction of energy demand and adding to inflationary pressures. At the same time, they should protect economic potential and ensure that the energy shock does not permanently reduce productive capacity. Just as excessively high energy demand would risk keeping inflation high for longer, so would a slump in economic potential. In response to the pandemic, Europeans acted together with consistent policies to protect productive capacity during the downturn. To tackle the energy shock effectively, we can take inspiration from some of the EU pandemic-era instruments - such as SURE - to protect jobs and businesses that may be forced to temporarily reduce their activity. Common interventions at European level would preserve a level playing field, avoiding competitive distortions that would otherwise be detrimental to economic efficiency and the integrity of the Single Market. Beyond targeted support in the short term, however, fiscal policy will need to focus on investment to reduce the European economy's exposure to supply shocks, strengthen its strategic autonomy and support potential growth. Here we could take inspiration from the Next Generation EU (NGEU) instrument and move beyond reshuffling existing funds in the financing of Repower EU, matching additional investment and reform needs with adequate resources. But we should also ensure that we are implementing, in full, the agreed investments and reforms that are tied to NGEU. This will contribute to economic resilience and debt sustainability, which are crucial in view of the prevailing interest rates and growth outlook. Let me conclude. We find ourselves in an exceptionally volatile environment, with multiple and complex risks for the inflation outlook and the appropriate monetary policy response. We are normalising our monetary policy to keep inflation expectations anchored and bring inflation back to 2% over the medium term. But we cannot ignore the sizeable challenges that we are facing. So we must calibrate our monetary policy carefully to ensure that inflation durably returns to our target, while also guiding market expectations and limiting excess volatility. Our policy stance must remain evidence-based and adapt to changes in the medium-term inflation outlook, avoiding an excessive focus on short-run developments and fully taking into account the risks emanating from the domestic and global economic and financial environment. This approach will allow us to successfully navigate the risks we face while avoiding the danger of tripping over unintended effects. Let's therefore mind the step in adjusting our monetary policy, so we can proceed steadily through the current shocks and bring the economy back to price stability and solid growth.","['inflationary', 'inflation', 'euro', 'eurosystem', 'monetary']","['inflation euro', 'risks inflation', 'risks euro', 'reinforcing inflationary', 'implications euro']","['euro reinforcing inflationary', 'risks inflation outlook', 'inflation monetary policy', 'inflation expectations ecb', 'monetary policy inflation']","['euro area headline hicp inflation', 'inflation outlook', 'term inflation outlook', 'inflationary developments', 'stabilises inflation']"
3246,r221104b_ECB,euro area,2022-11-04,The euro area economy and the energy transition,guindos,0,"I am very pleased to be taking part in this event on the important topic of the energy transition and its impact on the economy. Following the monetary policy decisions taken by the ECB's Governing Council last week, I will start by providing an overview of the euro area economic outlook that underpinned our deliberations. I will consider the impact of energy price developments on inflation before discussing the green transition and how climate change is taken into account in our monetary policy framework. Growth in the euro area is estimated to have slowed down significantly in the third quarter of this year, with real GDP growing at 0.2%. High inflation continues to dampen spending and production throughout the economy. Severe disruptions in the supply of gas have worsened the situation further, and both consumer and business confidence have fallen rapidly. Demand for services is decelerating following the strong rebound that came with the reopening of the economy over the summer, especially in tourism. The continued weakening in global demand, also in the context of tighter monetary policy in many major economies, and the worsening terms of trade mean that there is less support for the euro area economy. Inflation continued to rise, reaching 10.7% in October, driven by further increases in all its main components. Supply bottlenecks have eased but their impact is still gradually feeding through to consumer prices, as is the impact of pent-up demand in the services sector. The depreciation of the euro has also added to the build-up of inflationary pressures. Price pressures are evident in more and more sectors, in part owing to the impact of high energy costs feeding through to the whole economy. More than half of the items in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) have recorded inflation rates above 4% and measures of underlying inflation have remained at elevated levels. In particular, inflation excluding energy and food rose further, to 5%, in October. To support the timely return of inflation to our 2% medium-term target, our monetary policy aims to reduce support for demand and to ensure that inflation expectations remain anchored at our target. Last week we decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 75 basis points - the third major rate hike in a row - and we expect to raise interest rates further. We also changed the terms and conditions of the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) to ensure that its calibration is consistent with the broader monetary policy normalisation process and to reinforce the transmission of our policy rate increases to bank lending conditions. Finally, we decided to set the remuneration of minimum reserves held by credit institutions with the Eurosystem at the ECB's deposit facility rate since, in the current circumstances, it better reflects the rate at which funds can be invested in money market instruments or borrowed in money markets to fulfil minimum reserves. But let me return to inflation and its components. Energy price inflation - at 41.9% in October - remained the dominant driver of overall inflation. It caused a pronounced rise in inflation in the course of 2021 and at the beginning of 2022. While the initial rise in energy prices was driven mainly by the recovery in energy demand as lockdown measures were being eased, the subsequent price rally during 2021 was also significantly influenced by supply-side issues and later exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. European gas prices have increased particularly sharply since the summer of 2021. This reflects a combination of supply and demand factors that left European gas inventories at historically low levels and the gas market vulnerable to supply and demand uncertainty. As a result, consumer gas and electricity prices - both driven by natural gas prices - have played an increasingly important role in energy inflation dynamics. European gas spot prices have dropped strongly over recent weeks, owing to a variety of factors. These include weakening gas demand due to the mild near-term weather forecast, high storage levels, and a higher supply of liquefied natural gas and pipeline gas from Norway, as well as initiatives at national and EU level to curb gas demand, support supply and cap prices. However, the drop in gas futures prices has remained much more contained than the drop in spot prices, suggesting that the supply situation is still fragile. Looking further ahead, while supply bottlenecks are expected to ease further, the energy shock is expected to increasingly weigh on activity and inflation. Rising energy prices are expected to squeeze real disposable income and dampen production. At the same time, we may still see delayed pass-through of the past increases in wholesale energy prices to consumer prices which, together with recent geopolitical events, point to continuing upward pressures to the inflation energy component. The unprecedented energy price developments and the ensuing energy crisis are posing challenges in various ways. In fact, a trade-off between energy security, the green transition and price stability may be emerging. Despite the current monetary policy challenges, the ECB is seriously committed to doing its part to address climate change and promote the green transition, as this is necessary to fulfil our price stability objective. Climate change can have an impact on macroeconomic indicators, the stability of the financial system and the transmission of monetary policy. All these channels affect the outlook for price stability. Climate change also has a bearing on the ECB's own risk management. Our monetary policy operations have encompassed asset purchases, which now appear on the Eurosystem's balance sheet. Counterparties to our lending operations must pledge assets as collateral against the money they borrow. We need to consider the impact of climate change on the value and the risk profile of these assets to ensure that it does not jeopardise the achievement of our monetary policy objectives. Furthermore, without prejudice to our primary goal of safeguarding price stability, a secondary objective of the ECB is to support general economic policies in the EU. These include a high level of protection and improvement of the quality of the environment, in line with the EU's climate neutrality objectives. This means that if faced with a choice between two policy options that have a comparable impact on price stability, we should choose the option that better supports the secondary objective. In the strategy review we completed last year, we committed to including climate change considerations in our monetary policy operations. More concretely, we have decided to (i) adjust corporate bond holdings in our monetary policy portfolios, (ii) limit the share of assets issued by non-financial companies with a high carbon footprint that can be pledged as collateral by individual counterparties, (iii) introduce climate-related disclosure requirements in our collateral framework, and (iv) enhance our risk assessment and management. The aim is to gradually decarbonise our corporate bond holdings, on a path aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement. In practice, this involves measuring the climate performance of each eligible issuer based on its greenhouse gas emissions, carbon reduction targets and climate-related disclosures. Ultimately, this will result in the purchase of more bonds issued by companies with a good climate performance and fewer bonds from those with a poor climate performance. This tilting changes the composition of the monetary policy portfolio, but the overall purchase volume is still determined solely by monetary policy considerations - in line with our primary mandate. This process is already under way: as of 1 October we have started to tilt our reinvestment purchases towards issuers with a better climate performance. And from the first quarter of 2023, we will start to publish climate-related information on our corporate bond holdings. To enhance our risk assessment and risk management, the ECB is conducting a climate stress test on the Eurosystem's balance sheet, starting with the corporate holdings, to be finalised in the first half of 2023. The stress test builds on the methodologies developed for the previous climate stress testing exercises, in particular, the ECB's economy-wide climate stress test, which assessed the impact of physical and transition risks on the corporate loan portfolio of the euro area banking system, and the supervisory climate risk stress test, conducted with the involvement of the banks. Let me conclude. The current energy crisis has left Europe at a crossroads, presenting challenges as well as opportunities for the green transition. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent reduction of fossil fuel supplies have imposed a potential trade-off between energy security, the green transition and price stability. With inflation currently at elevated levels and expected to stay above our target for an extended period, monetary policy must remain focused on reducing support for demand and guarding against the risk of a persistent upward shift in inflation expectations. The longer inflation levels stay above our target, the greater the risk of second-round effects - through wage increases or the de-anchoring of inflation expectations. Amid the present uncertainty, future decisions on policy rates will continue to be data-dependent and follow a meeting-by-meeting approach. To keep the green transition on track, concrete policy actions are needed to make the most of the opportunities provided by the current energy crisis. Expanding the share of renewable energy supplies would reduce dependency on fossil fuels. It would also benefit price stability, given the declining prices for renewable energy observed during the past decade. In addition, to bring down energy costs sustainably over the medium term, governments should act to dismantle the regulatory barriers preventing the uptake of renewable energy, prioritise upgrading the electricity grid and foster investment in renewables. An important role for fiscal policy is to support the green transition via public green investment. To counter the sharp rise in energy prices, many governments adopted expensive and broad-based support measures for households and firms. But these measures risk diluting relative price signals that are crucial to incentivise energy saving and foster green investment. Instead, government support should be temporary and targeted towards vulnerable households and firms. This would also help to limit risks to fiscal sustainability. Fiscal policy and monetary policy need to work hand in hand. In view of the normalisation of monetary policy, it is essential to achieve a good balance between supporting energy security and ensuring price stability, while keeping the green transition on track.","['inflation', 'macroeconomic', 'inflationary', 'economy', 'euro']","['energy inflation', 'economy following', 'economy inflation', 'ecb economy', 'inflation continued']","['inflation rising energy', 'euro area economy', 'economy inflation continued', 'inflation dynamics european', 'economy following monetary']","['euro area economy', 'energy price inflation', 'current energy crisis', 'current monetary policy challenges', 'energy crisis']"
3247,r221104a_ECB,euro area,2022-11-04,Monetary policy in a high inflation environment: commitment and clarity ,lagarde,1,"Inflation in the euro area is far too high, reaching double digits for the first time in October. Here in Estonia inflation has surged as high as 25%. The combination of shocks we are facing - war, energy, disrupted supply chains, re-allocation of demand - means that inflation is likely to stay above our target for some time. In such challenging times, central banks have to rely on their inner compass - their loyalty to their mandate - to ensure price stability. They have to be prepared to take the necessary decisions, however difficult, to bring inflation back down - because the consequences of letting too-high inflation become entrenched would be much worse for everyone. So what does this imply? The answer can be found in the writing of Ragnar Nurkse, to whom this lecture series is dedicated. Though well known for his work on international financial architecture, he also made an important contribution to our understanding of inflation based on the experiences of the interwar years. In particular, he showed that fighting inflation is both complex and simple. Complex because, in times of great volatility, economies can face a series of shocks which produce rising and persistent inflation. Witness the 1920s when inflation was driven, in part, by tumbling exchange rates and acute supply bottlenecks, including for energy. But simple because, in the end, there is only one way that those shocks can lead to sustained inflation - and that is if monetary policy accommodates them and allows them to feed into inflation expectations. As Nurkse wrote, ""when a price rise goes on for some time [...] it tends to create expectations of a further rise. The point at which such expectations come to be firmly and widely held is a crucial one in the process of inflation. From that point onwards, the process is entirely changed."" Today, we are facing an extremely challenging environment where inflation is being driven by a range of different shocks. But it is monetary policy that will determine whether these shocks lead to lasting inflation. And we will not allow that to happen. We will therefore have to raise rates to levels that will deliver our 2% medium-term inflation target. The ultimate goal of our interest rate path is clear, and we are not there yet. In my remarks today, I would like to explain why we are facing such high inflation and assess the risks of it becoming embedded. But I will argue that with two ""Cs"" - commitment to our mandate and clarity about our reaction function - we can navigate the challenges successfully and bring inflation back down to our target. Since the start of the monetary union, we have not witnessed such a rapid shift in the inflation environment. Headline inflation in the euro area - which was negative as recently as December 2020 - has risen by 11 percentage points from its trough during the pandemic to its level last month. Core inflation, which excludes energy and food, has risen by 4.8 percentage points. Three interlocking factors have led to this turnaround: the fact that we are facing repeated shocks; that those shocks are passing through more strongly into inflation; and that they are proving more persistent than in the past due to structural changes in the economy. First, the euro area economy has been hit by an unprecedented series of shocks on both the demand and supply sides of the economy. This has restricted aggregate supply while also directing demand towards sectors with capacity constraints. We have faced pandemic-induced lockdowns, supply chain disruptions, energy production cuts, and Russia's unacceptable and unjustifiable invasion of Ukraine - all while demand has been shifting back and forth across sectors at speed. Recently, the reopening of the economy has led to a rapid release of pent-up demand, supported by high levels of excess savings. As a result, ECB analysis finds that demand and supply factors are currently contributing more or less equally to core inflation, with demand being more important for services and supply more important for industrial goods. The result has been a large and persistent inflationary shock. Second, we are seeing a faster and stronger pass-through of these shocks into prices. In the past, the pass-through of producer prices to industrial goods inflation typically took around two years and was often partially buffered by profit margins - i.e. firms absorbed some of the cost increases to avoid presenting consumers with large price rises. But ECB analysis finds that, recently, the pass-through to inflation has been taking place much faster, lasting only around half a year. And on average it has been more intense than in the past, with firms maintaining and, in some sectors, even increasing their profit margins. The reason is that when inflation is high everywhere and supply is constrained, firms can more easily pass on cost increases to customers without losing market share to their competitors. All this has meant that external shocks have seeped into underlying inflation - the part of inflation which is typically more ""sticky"". Even if some of the drivers can be expected to soften as bottlenecks ease, reopening effects fade out and energy prices stabilise, standard measures of underlying inflation in the euro area now range from around 4% to 8%. The third factor aggravating this situation is the persistence of the shocks due to structural changes in the economy. The shocks triggered by the pandemic and the war have created what I have previously called a ""new global map"" of economic relationships. And the economic turning points on this new global map imply that some supply constraints are likely to last longer. Two stand out. First, the cut in gas supplies caused by the Russian invasion is a major structural change which will have ramifications for several years. Futures market curves suggest that we will see higher gas prices for a time, as European countries will have to pay a premium to attract uncontracted LNG to replace Russian gas. Substitution effects will probably also increase prices for other sources of energy. Over the longer term, the war is also likely to accelerate the green transition in Europe, including the switch to renewable energy, which should ultimately lead to falling electricity prices. But we could see lower investment in oil and gas production during the transition phase, putting upward pressure on fossil fuel prices while demand for those fuels still remains high. Second, we are seeing changes in the nature of globalisation, and particularly China's role in it. The supply disruptions created by the pandemic, the vulnerabilities it has exposed and the new geopolitical landscape look set to trigger a reassessment of global value chains. While this will not lead to ""de-globalisation"", we can expect geopolitical factors to be re-introduced into supply chains. A recent survey finds that almost 90% of global firms are expecting to regionalise their production over the next three years. This is likely to reduce efficiency and increase costs, which could create inflationary pressures for some time while supply chains are adjusting. At the same time, domestic policy choices in China, as well as US export controls on key technologies, are likely to affect China's place in the global production network. This could become a profound global supply shock insofar as it leads the country to turn inwards and away from market-oriented reforms. Monetary policy cannot prevent the first-round effects of many of these shocks. But especially when the shocks are persistent, we must ensure they do not produce second-round effects that cause too-high inflation to become entrenched. Since the euro area is a net importer of energy, we are facing a large and unavoidable shock to real income owing to the deterioration in our terms of trade. This terms-of-trade ""tax"" amounted to around 2 percentage points of GDP in the second quarter of this year. The question that workers, firms and governments confront today is how this burden should be distributed within the economy and over time. Fair burden-sharing between wage income and profit margins is certainly justified. Fiscal policy can help spread the burden across different income groups. At the ECB, given our mandate of price stability, we need to ensure that this process does not lead to an inflationary dynamic. If inflation expectations become de-anchored and engrained in wage negotiations and price setting, that could lead to a wage-price spiral which in turn sustains the de-anchoring. And the result would ultimately be both lower real incomes and higher inflation over time. So how acute is the risk of second-round effects today? There are factors on the horizon which are likely to reduce demand and therefore, all else being equal, make it harder for firms to pass on cost increases into prices. As wholesale energy prices are passed through into retail bills, households are increasingly feeling the squeeze on real incomes and consumption is likely to fall. At the same time, pent-up demand from reopening is fading out. The drawdown of excess savings seems to be already largely counterbalanced by strengthening precautionary motives for saving and liquidity preference. In this context, although recent data on GDP growth have surprised on the upside, the risk of recession has increased. The same is true for Estonia, where Eesti Pank estimates growth to be -0.5% this year. This domestic slowdown might also be exacerbated by the synchronised tightening of monetary policy globally. ECB analysis finds that , since the early 1990s, US tightening has typically lowered industrial production in the euro area by as much as in the United States itself. However, historical evidence suggests that we should not expect slowing growth to make a significant dent in inflation, at least not in the near term. Looking at past euro area recessions going back to the 1970s, we see that headline inflation fell by an average of about 1.1 percentage points one year afterwards, while core inflation fell by about half that amount. Even the additional impact of foreign spillovers on demand will not necessarily lower inflation in the short term. Our analysis finds that US policy tightening tends to reduce euro area inflation in the medium term. But in the near term, inflation will rise if the euro depreciates against the US dollar and commodity prices go up in euro terms. In this context, we are likely to see wages ""catching up"" to some extent with higher inflation, since the conditions are in place for workers to try to recoup losses in their real income. The labour market has remained resilient so far, with forward-looking indicators showing little sign of weakening. Inflation expectations have been creeping up. In parallel, governments are facing pressures to increase indexation, for instance by tying pensions and public sector wages to inflation, which could add to wage pressures in the private sector too. This outlook is confirmed by evidence from the latest collective bargaining rounds and our corporate telephone survey, both of which point to a rise in negotiated wages next year of around 4%. Here in Estonia, wage growth is currently running at around 10%. These developments do not constitute excessive second-round effects so far, and at longer horizons inflation expectations remain anchored. But with inflation likely to remain high for an extended period, we need to monitor inflation expectations and wage negotiations very carefully to ensure that wage growth does not settle persistently at levels that are incompatible with our target. So how should monetary policy be calibrated in this setting to ensure price stability? In my view, two ""Cs"" are key: commitment to our mandate and clarity about our reaction function. Displaying commitment to our mandate is vital to ensure that inflation expectations remain anchored and second-round effects do not take hold. A number of recent decisions by the Governing Council underline our determination in this regard. First, we have been raising rates at our fastest pace ever - by 200 basis points in our last three policy meetings. In this way, we are signalling our resolve to deliver on our target, which should be immediately reflected in inflation expectations. Policy normalisation also withdraws support for demand at times of inelastic supply, which should lead to firms revising down their selling price expectations. Second, we decided last week to amend the terms and conditions of our targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO-III). The TLTRO addressed the need for significant stimulus during the pandemic, strengthening the transmission of rates to the economy via banks. But now the environment has changed completely - and we need to ensure that the lower cost of funding the TLTRO creates for banks does not impede monetary transmission when policy normalisation is required. This complements our previous actions to preserve the orderly transmission of rates to the economy via financial markets, notably flexible reinvestments under the pandemic emergency purchase programme and the new transmission protection instrument. While it is true that interest rates remain the most effective tool for addressing the high inflation environment, it is important to signal, as we continuously do in our monetary policy statement, that ""we stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate to ensure that inflation returns to our medium-term inflation target"". In this context, as I explained at last week's press conference, in December we will lay out the key principles for reducing the bond holdings purchased as part of our monetary policy portfolios. But we need to pair commitment with clarity about our reaction function. In view of the uncertainty we face today, it is no longer appropriate for monetary policy to give detailed forward guidance. Given the complexity of the shocks we are facing, being able to respond to the incoming data is a major advantage. But making policy meeting-by-meeting in a data-dependent way can come at a cost. In particular, market rate volatility is higher in response to news. This is why - rather than guiding markets by giving a specific target for rates - it is important to clarify our reaction function. As stated earlier, we have increased rates by 200 basis points and we expect to raise rates further. Our job is far from being completed. And withdrawing accommodation may not be enough to bring inflation back to our target. How much further we need to go, and how fast we need to get there, will be determined by the following factors. The first and most important is the inflation outlook: we will raise rates to levels that bring inflation back down to our medium-term target in a timely manner. The inflation outlook is forward-looking and incorporates all the different forces we are facing: the outlook for the economy, the persistence of the shocks and the reaction of wages and inflation expectations. Current inflation numbers are relevant insofar as they provide additional insights about the persistence of inflation. The second factor is the corresponding policy stance and its transmission lags into demand and inflation. Monetary policy is inherently forward-looking, as interest rate changes will only reach their full effect over the next year or two. As a result, while the impact of policy decisions will strengthen over time, it will be seen in the hard data only with a time lag. But this lag in transmission and the prevailing uncertainty also means that the rate path ahead will look different depending on the contingencies we face. If we were to see, for example, inflation becoming more persistent and expectations being at risk of de-anchoring, we could not wait until the full impact of the policy measures materialises. We would need to take additional actions until we are more confident that inflation will return to target in a timely manner. There is also another important dimension to clarity: providing clarity about how the intentions of other policy areas will affect the inflation outlook and thereby our policy actions. During the pandemic, the actions of fiscal and monetary policies were naturally aligned. Fiscal policy needed to prevent a catastrophic collapse of employment, and monetary policy had to prevent a steep decline in inflation. Both supported price stability. Today, however, the alignment between policies is not so automatic. With the economy slowing and real incomes falling, fiscal policy could shift towards a more expansionary stance over and above the contribution from the automatic stabilisers. But in a supply constrained environment, that can exacerbate inflationary pressures and force the central bank to tighten policy by more than would otherwise be necessary. This is why we have emphasised the need for fiscal support to be temporary, targeted and tailored. It should be temporary, so that it does not push up demand too much over the medium term. It should be targeted, so that the size of the fiscal impulse is limited and benefits those who need it most. And it should be tailored, so that it does not weaken incentives to cut energy demand. Over time, fiscal policies will have to consolidate - and it will make a difference for inflation whether this is done by reducing transfers and public consumption and raising taxes or, as has often happened in the past, by cutting public investment. As many of the sources of inflation today are on the supply side, government policies that redirect investment to where it is needed will be essential to achieve non-inflationary growth. Let me conclude. The environment we confront today is complex. We are facing shocks from various sides, while navigating a new global map that is causing those shocks to persist for longer. But what monetary policy ultimately has to achieve is simple: we must not, and will not, let high inflation become entrenched. We are committed to bringing inflation back down to our medium-term target, and we are determined to take the necessary measures to do so. The more confident the public is that inflation will return to 2% in a timely manner, the smoother the adjustment process will be. As Samuel Johnson wrote, ""great works are performed not by strength, but by perseverance"". And we will persevere until we have ensured price stability in the euro area.","['inflation', 'inflationary', 'monetary', 'recessions', 'recession']","['estonia inflation', 'exacerbate inflationary', 'inflation inflation', 'high inflation', 'inflation high']","['inflation entrenched euro', 'estonia inflation surged', 'reason inflation high', 'inflation taking place', 'high inflation entrenched']","['estonia inflation', 'high inflation', 'euro area inflation', 'higher inflation', 'underlying inflation']"
4948,r221110a_SNB,switzerland,2022-11-10,Current challenges to central banks' independence,jordan,1,"Ladies and gentlemen I am very grateful for the opportunity to give this year's O. John Olcay Lecture on Ethics and Economics. John Olcay was a remarkable person and a true gentleman. He had an exceptionally thorough understanding of politics, economics and markets, and was always willing and eager to discuss a broad range of topics. John was also a friend of mine, and a steadfast supporter of the Swiss National Bank. It is a great honour and a pleasure for me to give this lecture in his memory today. I was scheduled to give this lecture in 2020, but this had to be postponed because of the pandemic. Just two years ago, many central banks wanted inflation to nudge up closer to their targets, and there were some calls for central banks to directly finance fiscal expenditures. Since then, the political and economic context has changed dramatically. Inflation is far too high almost everywhere, and central banks are raising their policy interest rates at a time when stocks of government debt are large. In some places, central bank independence is being publicly called into question. Such explicit pressure to curb central bank independence is a fairly recent phenomenon. It was not prevalent in recent decades; on the contrary, there was a firm consensus among economists, politicians and the general public on the need for central bank independence. This consensus was based not only on theory, but also on practical experience. Price stability can only be achieved with an independent monetary policy, i.e. without political pressure on the central bank. In the absence of central bank independence, governments concerned about re-election might try to engineer an expansionary monetary policy in order to temporarily reduce debt financing costs and stimulate economic activity. Over time, this would inevitably lead to high inflation. Without central bank independence, various political groups could also force the central bank to pursue additional goals. This would lead to conflicts of interest and eventually to doubts regarding the ability or willingness of the central bank to ensure price stability. Equally important, given these conflicts of interest, if central banks pursue goals other than price stability, the legitimacy of independence can easily be questioned. This is why independent central banks have been given narrow mandates. In this lecture, I will argue that threats to central banks' independence, and thus to their ability to fulfil their monetary policy mandates, are ever present and take various forms. While some are obvious, others lurk beneath the surface. Such threats are particularly acute in the current economic environment. Taking a Swiss perspective, I will discuss the pitfalls that must be avoided in order to make certain that monetary policy is set independently and that central banks have the freedom to pursue policies that ensure price stability in the medium to long term. I will begin by discussing the need to delimit central banks' actions relative to fiscal policy. Monetary and fiscal authorities typically take their decisions separately, without coordinating between one another. This is for good reason. History teaches us that when central banks are closely tied to the fiscal authority, expansionary monetary policy is often used, directly or indirectly, to finance government deficits. Time and again, this has ended in high inflation. High inflation is undesirable for lots of reasons. It reduces consumer purchasing power, and hits low income households particularly hard. Moreover, inflation causes price distortions that lead to the misallocation of resources and therefore inefficiency. Since higher inflation also tends to go hand-in-hand with more volatile inflation, it causes investment uncertainty and raises risk premia. Furthermore, reducing high inflation can be very costly. For all these reasons, it is the mandate of central banks to ensure price stability. This typically also includes supporting economic activity. In Switzerland, the central bank has been entrusted with ensuring price stability while taking due account of economic developments. Our mandate is thus limited to the essential contribution a central bank can make to society. Furthermore, the independence of the Swiss National Bank is guaranteed by the Constitution. Safeguarding independence is crucial for central banks to be able to fulfil their mandate. If the public suspects that monetary authorities are making decisions with the objective of propping up government finances, it will anticipate that this will result in higher inflation. As such expectations have a major effect on actual inflation, through wage bargaining and price setting, inflation can quickly get out of control. It is thus important to avoid even the appearance that fiscal considerations might be dominating monetary policy. Nevertheless, it is also important to note that independent central banks cannot ignore the effects of fiscal policy when setting monetary policy in accordance with their mandate. Fiscal policy can impact on growth, inflation, interest rates and risk premia. Accounting for these effects of fiscal policy on the macroeconomy and monetary conditions is part of sensible monetary policy that aims to maintain price stability. Let me now briefly address the exceptional monetary and fiscal legacy since the global financial crisis, and the challenges that this legacy poses to central bank independence today. After the onset of the global financial crisis, many central banks decreased their policy interest rates to very low levels, and even into negative territory, in countries such as Switzerland. They also brought down longer-term interest rates by buying government and corporate bonds. This increased central banks' balance sheets and the risks they bear. Two years ago, measures taken to contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic strongly restricted business activity. Fiscal and monetary policies responded forcefully. Via social benefit schemes and stimulus packages, fiscal authorities helped stabilise the economy. Unprecedented fiscal stimulus led to a substantial rise in already high public debt in many countries. Via liquidity provision, central banks ensured that the markets continued to function, and with loose monetary policy they aimed to stabilise economic activity and avoid deflation. Moreover, an efficient response to this very unusual economic crisis required and warranted cooperation between monetary and fiscal policy. Monetary and fiscal authorities adopted coordinated policies to avoid a credit crunch that could have brought a wave of bankruptcies and massive unemployment. Many businesses were particularly hard hit by the restrictions which governments imposed to contain the spread of infection. The aim of the coordinated policies was to allow these businesses to obtain funding quickly and at favourable terms. It was crucial that illiquidity did not turn into insolvency. In Switzerland, for instance, a joint programme combining measures by the federal government, the Swiss National Bank and the private sector was set up to bridge firms' liquidity shortfalls. As a result of this effective programme, within a few weeks a fifth of all Swiss firms had obtained loans to handle the liquidity shortfall caused by the pandemic. During the coronavirus pandemic, such coordinated efforts between fiscal and monetary authorities were necessary. And they were also easy to align because fiscal and monetary policy had to move in the same expansionary direction. But central banks must now signal unequivocally that this coordination was not a first step towards letting fiscal needs dominate monetary policy. This is important for two reasons. First, such cooperation should always be limited both in time, as well to exceptional circumstances. It should not be confused with central banks giving up their independence. And second, the geopolitical and economic environment has now changed drastically. While the pandemic initially reduced both activity and inflation, multiple factors such as supply bottlenecks, pent-up demand as well as the monetary and fiscal stimulus soon began putting upward pressure on prices. The sharp increase in energy prices, driven in part by the war in Ukraine, has pushed prices up further, while at the same time slowing growth. Monetary policy now has to be tightened in an environment of high government debt. The principle that central banks should not let fiscal needs dominate monetary policy has always held true. But in the current environment, characterised by high inflation and slowing activity, as well as with the legacy of high government debt and large central bank balance sheets, sticking to this principle is particularly challenging. I will now set out two kinds of fiscal dominance, which I will refer to as misused and misguided monetary policy. Misused monetary policy consists of the central bank explicitly deciding to help government finances, and reflects a lack of good and stable governance. Misguided monetary policy occurs when central banks' judgement is altered to avoid political pressure, which leads to policy mistakes that help government finances. Let me start with misused monetary policy, which can take two forms, one obvious and one more subtle. The obvious form of fiscal dominance would be for the central bank to be pressured to directly finance the government. It could be asked to directly buy the country's public debt, which essentially means printing money to finance the government's expenditures. Or it could even more blatantly give the money as a 'present', to the detriment of its own equity. Most central bank laws forbid such direct financing, however. Nevertheless, during the coronavirus crisis, some economists advocated direct monetary financing of fiscal expenditures. Typically, these proposals involved a one-off payment tied to specific government spending, such as coronavirus-related economic costs. But this is a slippery slope. If monetary policy is used to finance one fiscal purpose, there will soon be another worthy idea, and one thereafter. In the end, monetary policy will be unable to concentrate on its price stability mandate. Allow me to briefly mention two important issues in this context: asset purchase programmes and profit distribution. In recent years, many central banks bought government debt as a way of easing monetary conditions. These purchases were directly linked to central banks' mandates and designed to lower long-term interest rates for the whole economy. The purpose of these purchases was not to support government financing, and therefore did not constitute monetary financing in disguise. Central banks' profit distribution does not represent monetary financing in disguise either. These profits stem from the monopoly of creating central bank money. Central banks usually retain a part of the profits they generate to build up their own capital and then transfer the remainder to the government. Like asset purchase programmes, profit distribution is not dictated by government finances. Of course, there is always a risk of political pressure resulting in asset purchase programmes or profit transfers being too big, thus leading to higher inflation over time. But let me come back to the risk of monetary policy being misused for fiscal purposes. In addition to direct pressure on central banks to finance government spending, a second and more subtle form of misused policy exists. It occurs if central banks are pressured or even told not to increase interest rates or not to sell assets as much or as fast as needed to fight inflation, in order to help government finances. A weaker-than-necessary monetary policy response can cause higher-than-expected inflation, which reduces the real value of government debt. In the current situation, central banks could be asked to delay or limit raising interest rates. This would keep the governments' debt financing costs low. At the same time, it would limit the losses on the central banks' longmaturity assets and thus keep profit distribution to the government artificially higher. While direct government financing would mean openly breaking the law, this indirect financing by means of deliberately adopting an overly expansionary monetary policy and tolerating increased inflation would 'only' result in the central bank failing to achieve its mandate. Fiscal dominance is, however, not limited to directly misused monetary policy. This brings me to a second pitfall that can compromise central bank independence: misguided monetary policy. This risk arises within the central bank and is much harder to detect. Determining the appropriate monetary policy stance has never been easy. In recent years, global crises and structural changes have led to substantial uncertainty in the macroeconomic outlook. For example, the equilibrium real rate of interest and the output gap are difficult to determine, and the effects of structural trends, such as globalisation, on inflation are hard to assess. Failure to appropriately account for higher equilibrium real interest rates, lower potential output or de-globalisation could lead to an overly expansionary monetary policy and higher inflation. Central bank staff try to capture structural changes in their models to formulate their recommendations to policymakers. Monetary policy decisions are then taken based on the available evidence, while taking into account model uncertainty. However, limited information and knowledge allow for wide room to manoeuvre. In the current environment, a bias towards a slightly expansionary monetary policy option can therefore result from political pressures, as the uncertainty can justify a decision that happens to help government finances. Potential political pressures can tilt monetary policy recommendations towards an expansionary bias through different channels. Let me give three examples. First, central banks may lean towards the conclusion that more expansionary monetary policy is needed when interpreting their own analyses, simply because they want to avoid political pressure in the short run. The implicit hope is that, as the central bank postpones the tightening of monetary policy, the government financing issues disappear before inflation increases. Second, at the current juncture it is difficult to identify to what extent inflation is persistent and to what extent it is transitory. Our own surveys show that Swiss firms are now able to pass on higher input prices to customers more easily than before, and workers' wage bargaining power is rising. Such structural changes, together with the fact that the monetary expansion and the fiscal stimuli from the past feed into inflation with a lag, might cause an underestimation of the persistence of inflation. As a result, central banks might respond less than they should to the observed inflation increase. They may tighten policy too slowly in order to avoid the risk of an economic slowdown and thereby putting the government in a more difficult position. Third, there is uncertainty regarding the timing and size of the price-increasing effects of deglobalisation. Policymakers might have a bias in attributing too much of the observed inflation increase to one-time adjustment effects in international supply chains, and therefore avoid tightening policy and curbing demand. Of course, that would again help government finances in the short term. Detecting misguided policy is much harder than detecting misused policy. Central bank actions are taken amid high uncertainty, and there are major debates over whether structural changes are happening and how monetary policy has to respond to them. Given the transmission lags of monetary policy, the true considerations behind accommodative biases can go undetected for a long time. And as there are several structural changes taking place at the same time, any hidden influence of fiscal dominance might never be identified. So where do we stand today? The misuse of monetary policy, with the purpose of financing the government, is becoming a real risk. Central banks have started tightening monetary policy in order to bring inflation back down, and are thus focusing on their mandates. But further tightening may not be met with enthusiasm from parts of society. With rising debt servicing costs, political pressure to postpone, slow down or limit the tightening could arise. Moreover, as inflation is persistent and higher than central banks' targets, central banks are politically more vulnerable. In some instances, politicians have already started publicly questioning central bank independence. That pressure alone could make central banks more willing to help governments in order to avoid changes to their own institutional arrangements and mandates. What about the risk of misguided policy, i.e. an expansionary monetary policy bias in the current environment? With higher government debt and structural economic uncertainty, this risk has also increased. Trying to avoid political criticism might affect central banks' judgement in the current economic situation. And this situation is tricky. To fight inflation effectively, central banks need independence - precisely at a time when such independence is at risk because of high inflation. This leads me to ask one final question: How can independence best be ensured? My answer has three elements. First of all, the dividing line between monetary and fiscal policy must remain clear. Central banks have to make sure that the cooperation between monetary and fiscal policy that was necessary during the pandemic is not perceived as a first step to fiscal dominance. Even though optimal policy coordination suggests a better macroeconomic outcome in some theoretical models where a central planner acts in the best interests of the country, central banks should stick to the principle of no coordination. For politicians facing elections, the temptation of monetary financing can simply be too large. A clear dividing line between monetary and fiscal policy is best achieved when central banks have narrow mandates focused on their core task: ensuring medium-term price stability. There is currently a tendency towards broadening central banks' mandates with goals such as tackling climate change or inequality. In Switzerland, there is the idea of financing the pension system with the profits generated by the SNB. But the responsibility for these tasks plainly lies with the government. Including such additional goals would lead to implicit coordination between monetary and fiscal policy and increase the risk of fiscal dominance. The second element to ensure central bank independence is to prevent monetary policy from being misused for government finances. Financial conditions should now be tightened with a clear focus on bringing inflation back to target. Fulfilling its mandate is the purpose of a central bank, its raison d'etre. With a return to price stability, central banks will be less vulnerable, as they can then no longer be blamed for failing to achieve their mandate. The third element to defend central bank independence is to make sure that monetary policy is not misguided and thus avoids an underlying expansionary bias. Central banks should be selfcritical in their economic analyses. They must always be aware of the political convenience of erring on the side of caution in tightening monetary policy. But the focus has to be on the available data and on the central bank mandate. When new information changes the picture, central banks must adjust their assessment, adapt their policy and communicate this clearly. By doing their job well, central banks prove that they are using their independence in the best interests of society. With this, ladies and gentlemen, let me conclude. Risks to central bank independence are real and present around the globe, also in Switzerland. It is crucial for central banks to be independent, not for independence's own sake, but as a means of fulfilling their mandate and serving society as a whole. Independence must be defended. And central banks must prove themselves worthy of the independence and the trust that they have been given.
