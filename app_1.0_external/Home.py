            Welcome to our cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) project app!  \n
            Our app is designed to scan and analyze text-based market information using the power of transformed-based language models. \n
            We have leveraged the power of the :blue[**BERT transformer**] method to analyze the :blue[**speeches given by central bank officials**]. 
            By extracting keywords from the speeches and tracing the popularity of meaningful topics over the years, we can analyze how central banks' priorities and concerns have evolved over time. \n           
            This insight is invaluable for policymakers, economists, and researchers, who need to stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the financial markets.

            Also,a keyword heat map is generated, which provides a visual representation of the central bank speech's most significant keywords.  
            This heat map is particularly useful in identifying trends and patterns in the data, allowing for easier interpretation and analysis.
